Would need to check if we can make it work with selenium (I think I checked and it can work)  \n10:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think it kills your build if it takes >10mn  \n10:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so you need to fix the build in order to use it :)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now api-xff took 5mn to build that's a lot  \n10:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah :(  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not our fault  \n10:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep I remember there is some limitation but don't remember which one, jdeb is pretty small thing to build  \n10:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well in the end it's always our fault, even if only because we picked faulty tools  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Unlimited Build Minutes\"  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://travis-ci.com/plans  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for open source)  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: not really  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't conrol the cpu they use  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*control  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and locally I'm sure it takes under 1 minute  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it has to be their fault  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think travis is shared resources so it depends how many project are building at the same time  \n10:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm last cjdns build was 23 seconds  \n10:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0https://travis-ci.org/cjdelisle/cjdns  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're right cjd: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/3849  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least in may that's what they were doing apparnetly  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0killing if no output is received within 10 minutes  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's ok  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't do that  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we send back output  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as we progress  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and I can understand the need  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they could end up with tons on ghosts otherwise  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure, it's a good thing  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I'm saying is that I don't think this would be a problem for us  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless their cpu is really slow  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe for the gwt compilation for ex  \n10:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm  \n10:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Just did a scan of c and h files in cjdns project  \n10:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0totals 5,496,395  \n10:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0lines of code  \n10:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and whitespace and comments  \n10:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a023 seconds  \n10:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0(travis builds everything from scratch)  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just did a check on my assembly code 1M lines of code and it executes in 5 seconds  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're beaten cjd!  \n10:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0where?  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's becasue you're using a slow language  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should use binary directly  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt the actual java compilation is what takes most of the time  \n10:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0where is your asm ? I wanna code-review it :P  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: please stop comparing cjdns with xwiki it makes no sense on any point  \n10:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh this morning is starting off great <trollface>  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well I understand that there are limitations which XWiki has to deal with, but on the other hand I don't want to let you off the hook saying \"not our fault, slow machine\"  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh yes we should definitely keep searching for ideas to improve our build  \n10:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0truth lies somewhere in between  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but comparing cjdns doesn't help  \n10:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I only pull that comparison when you pull the \"this is just fine, it's not our fault\" :)  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's simple  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0build api-xff locally  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it takes 5 minutes then I'll admit my mistake  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(haven't tried yet)  \n10:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0probably longer because empty maven local repo  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jean seems to have added a cache  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAICS  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but I'm no travis expert)  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it'll kick in for the next build  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed 5mn to get all deps seems a good explanation  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I didn't see that in the console logs  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex: https://travis-ci.org/xwiki-contrib/api-xff/jobs/87626547  \n10:18\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Total time: 34.740 s  \n10:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0cool  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0apparently they run it twice  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then mvn test -B  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh didn't know about this, nice :)  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://www.codacy.com/app/woshilapin/api-xff/dashboard  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very nice: \"Impact of every Commit and Pull Request\" at https://www.codacy.com/  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey nice too: sends comments in your PR  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or jenkins)  \n10:34\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you have missing documentation on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12718  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: any idea if http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/2045/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-xclass-test-tests/testReport/org.xwiki.xclass.test.ui/ClassSheetTest/createClass/ is related to your work on XClass ?  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also if you have an idea of what caused 34 failing Wysiwyg tests  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks tmortagne, I'll add doc for it in 15mn  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I looks at some of them and they seems to be caused by some wrong html rendering  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looked  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it started around 20th of October it seems  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't see any commit that could be related on that date  \n10:49\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n10:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we still have quite a few issue open for 7.3M2...  \n10:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: we keep pushing XWIKI-12165, either it's a real blocker and we should fix it or we lower it's priority  \n10:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: re class sheet, yes most probably caused by my changes. I'll handle it asap. I'm finishing with http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12430 first  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: we can lower it, even though it's a regression. Denis1: would be great to know when you can work on it :)  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: when do you plan to finish XWIKI-12605 ?  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doc fixed  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes I had forgotten about it, I should hace done it in M2  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unfortunately now I won't have time before 7.4M1  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you could push it to 7.4M1  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll do it  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n10:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: re wysiwyg tests, seems like the browser is not behaving as expected. Either we upgraded Selenium but we didn't upgrade the Firefox version on the agents, or we upgraded the Firefox version on the agents without upgrading Selenium.

Contributors loose sight of documents.  \n12:06\u00a0<helge>\u00a0I could not find anything in the .xar.
