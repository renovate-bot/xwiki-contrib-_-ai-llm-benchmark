I am OK that it is NOT visible since I don't know its purpose, I am just wondering WHY in terms or RIGHTS MANAGEMENT it is not visible (i.e. I don't see the magic/logic where it happens)  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0qwebirc80844: it's a technical space containing the code in wiki pages for the annotation feature  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a hidden space in the list of \"blacklisted\" spaces  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this list is defined in a template (.vm) file  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and can be overridden in a wiki page)  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikivars.vm  \n12:07\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0oh, thanks! there is magic in there!  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0qwebirc80844: see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/templates/xwikivars.vm  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#set ($blacklistedSpaces = ['Import', 'Panels', 'Scheduler', 'Stats', 'XAppClasses', 'XAppSheets', 'XAppTemplates', 'XWiki', 'WatchCode', 'WatchSheets', 'XApp', 'WatchAdmin', 'Watch', 'ColorThemes', 'AnnotationCode'])  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the future we'll improve this to make it less magic  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie spaces themselves will tell whether they're \"hidden\"/\"technical\" or not  \n12:10\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0yes, as an attribute of some sort, would make sense  \n12:11\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0Also, would it be risky to set \"Unregistered Users\" a negative right to VIEW at the WIKI level and ONLY enable it explicitely for the spaces I want them to be able to see?  \n12:12\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0In case somebody creates a secret space and forgets to explicitly forbids access to Unregistered Users  \n12:12\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0I'd imagine I'd need to add some explicit VIEW rights to some hidden space (templates, etc.)  \n12:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0qwebirc80844: don't give negative right unless you absolutely need too, just give the right to someone else and Guest will loose the right  \n12:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0said another way if you give a right to anyone the right loose inheritance for everyone at this level  \n12:29\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0OK, I see. That works with Groups as well? i.e. if I give a right to a GROUP, do I actually REMOVE that right for the \"Unregistered users\" or not?  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep groups and users work the same way  \n12:30\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0k  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we generally only use groups for right and then you just need to modify groups  \n12:30\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0Any idea why the \"Invitation\" space is visible to a dumb user DESPITE having explicitly negative rights set for \"XWikiAllGroup\"?  \n12:31\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0(this \"dumb\" user is part of no group outside of the implicit XWikiAllGroup)  \n12:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0right is only used when you really access the object but not when just listing them  \n12:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think there is a jira issue about that  \n12:32\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0No, I can actually click on it and it shows me the screen where I can send an invite (Invitation messenger)  \n12:33\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0While for other spaces, If I explicitly put negative rights, they don't even get listed, which is what I'd expect  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0arre you sure right is forbidden \u00a0then ?  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe there is some right at the page level  \n12:33\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0The entire line has red circles for XWikiAllGroup  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0overriding the sapce right  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0forget that  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0actually negative right as prioprity  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0priority  \n12:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't know well invitation application so I could not tell you what's wrong exactly  \n12:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what is the URL of the page you are accessing that you should not ?  \n12:35\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0http://wiki.cloudbees.com/bin/view/Invitation/WebHome  \n12:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0indeed if you gave negative right to guest on Invitation space I really don't see how you can acces this page  \n12:36\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0maybe because it is an application, it gets different treatment  \n12:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0nop  \n12:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the aapplication is a script in the page  \n12:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but the script should not even be executed since you don't have the right  \n12:37\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0indeed, strange...  \n12:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0try reconfiguring your right avoiding negative rights  \n12:39\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0same thing  \n12:40\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0I've put GREEN to ADMIN on all rights, then empty box for AllGroup and my dumb user can still see it  \n12:45\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0found: http://xwiki.markmail.org/search/?q=disable+invitation+space+list%3Aorg.xwiki.users#query:disable%20invitation%20space%20list%3Aorg.xwiki.users+page:1+mid:3hq62sm22jwwvzcq+state:results  \n12:46\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0tricky :)  \n12:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0always check the whole inheritance chain :)  \n12:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0did not looked at the details but does not sounds very nice to have custom right on theses pages to me  \n12:47\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0yes, as you said  \n12:47\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0I just want to disable it, which means unset rights on that page and we are good to go  \n12:48\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0I couldn't find the access rights for that page from the invitation page itself, had to list all pages from the space instead and do it from there  \n12:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0qwebirc80844: is you user configured as advanced user ?  \n12:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then you get a dropdown list on edit containing right editor among other things  \n12:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0edit=edit button on the top left corner of the document content  \n13:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<qwebirc80844>\u00a0yes, I am , but NOT with that screen!
