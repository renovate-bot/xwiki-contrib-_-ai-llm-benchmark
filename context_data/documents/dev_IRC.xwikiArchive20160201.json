To stop it, run the stop\\_xwiki.bat script on Windows and stop\\_xwiki.sh on Unix or Mac.

 \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah\u2026. that's different :)  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed that should lead to the user used by the bot being caught as a spammer  \n16:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0antispam system disbaled XWiki user that try to save spam ?

 \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah I don't know which one is best, could need both  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I do need the space one for sure  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the antispam files  \n16:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0maybe an xwql query to be sure to have everything ?

 \n17:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0X-Forwarded-For  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand what xwiki would do in xwiki.cfg  \n17:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0whether or not to consider that IP to be the originator  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm using httpservletrequest.getRemoteAddr()  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's independent of xwiki.cfg  \n17:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0check that it's not overridden by xwiki.cfg parameter...  \n17:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0clever method -> spot the header and change getRemoteAddr() to show the right one  \n17:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but that must be able to be disabled  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, indeed, that would require configuration  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now anyone could fake such a header I guess  \n17:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeap :)  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess the CF one would be more accurate  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless CF also updates the XFF one  \n17:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Nah, if you are behind a proxy, XFF is accurate  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that the XFF one is a list  \n17:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0how long is the list ?  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if the user has put a XFF header, I guess the proxy will only add to it  \n17:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0better lookup the spec but probably indeed it represents the proxy chain if there is one  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'd need to find the ip just before the CF one  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that means knowing the CF one  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I know their range  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still hard work...  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I just need to take the last but one  \n17:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nah  \n17:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well yeah  \n17:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0either the first IP or the last  \n17:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0because you know you are behind 1 proxy (CF) you want to use the first IP in the list because everything beyond the first (CF) is something from the user  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the complex part is that this is different for each setup...  \n17:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0unless it's backward :)  \n17:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0check xwiki.cfg, there's something about this iirc  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's nothing  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0couldn't find it at least  \n17:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and doesn't ring a bell  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"where the value is a comma+space separated list of IP addresses, the left-most being the original client\" so it's indeed the last but one  \n17:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0cool  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's in the case of CF though  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(i.e. xwiki.org)  \n18:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you're right: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/7b073b9145ed62425abd7768b43c60cce347dc57/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/web/XWikiServletRequest.java#L333-L333 and https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/f1ff5d11cb4d42f9f9ae7b7b696e8f7c4b916d20/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/user/impl/xwiki/MyPersistentLoginManager.java#L675-L675  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the implmentations are all plain wrong  \n18:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0:)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0crappy impl work...  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whoever did this didn't check the spec  \n18:32\u00a0<iphar`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0restarting xwiki.org once more  \n19:09\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:12\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok works :)  \n19:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0restarting xwiki.org (last time for today!) - this time to fix a wrong upgrade config - hibernate.cfg.xml was missing \"<mapping resource=\"mailsender.hbm.xml\"/>\"  \n19:52\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:37\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has quit  \n20:39\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:52\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:55\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n20:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:18\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has quit  \n21:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: caught one :)  \n23:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0caught several actually  \n23:24\u00a0<RalucaS>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:25\u00a0<RalucaS>\u00a0has quit  \n23:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
