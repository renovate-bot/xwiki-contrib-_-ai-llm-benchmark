 \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(on jenkins)  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I just clicked build on platform and it gets executed on agent3  \n09:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's not exactly all the time but jenkins tend to reuse always the same agent for the same job when possible  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean the last agent where it ran?  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would explain it indeed  \n09:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep I think it's the last  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0myxwiki.org just restarted it sees  \n10:13\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I have to go now, I'll be offline for the rest of the afternoon but I'll be back in the evening  \n11:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: just tried a git checkout xwiki-commons-3.2-milestone-3 and I have the same problem as yesterday  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you probably need to fetch tags  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I can see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/tree/xwiki-commons-3.2-milestone-3 is here  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i have the tag that's not the problem  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but when I check it out if I verify the top level pom it contains 3.2-SNAPSHOT  \n12:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok I tough you were talking about tag not here issue  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that said https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/blob/xwiki-commons-3.2-milestone-3/pom.xml seems ok  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it must be some refresh issue  \n12:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I did a git pull \u2014rebase  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0isn't that refreshing my whole repo?  \n12:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not sure pull deal with tags  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0prolly not apparently  \n12:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's why I told you to specifillay fetch tags  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying git fetch --tags  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed:  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vmassol@vincent-massols-macbook-pro ~/dev/xwiki/git/xwiki-commons (master) $ git fetch --tags  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0remote: Counting objects: 110, done.  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0remote: Compressing objects: 100% (28/28), done.  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0remote: Total 59 (delta 30), reused 59 (delta 30)  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Unpacking objects: 100% (59/59), done.  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0From github.com:xwiki/xwiki-commons  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0- [tag update] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0xwiki-commons-3.2-milestone-3 -> xwiki-commons-3.2-milestone-3  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n12:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cool it works since I sounds a bid weird to update a tags that is supposed to be read only thing  \n12:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but since it's just a pointer I guess git does not care and it's just a convention to not touch it like with svn  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n13:44\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have a staging repo for xwiki comons 3.2M3: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/orgxwiki-053/  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to release it in a few seconds\u2026 which means it'll get synced to maven central  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(will do the rendering 3.2M3 later if it succeeds)  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done, we're now here: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/xwiki/commons/  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the record I've had to cheat a bit...  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're currently violating a central repo rule\u20262 of our artifacts don't have a javadoc jar generated  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because they only contain internal code and we don't generate javadoc for internal code  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now the only workaround I can find is to add a build step for those modules and use the antrun plugin to create a target/apidocs directory\u2026.  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which will make the javadoc plugin gneerate an \"empty'\" javadoc jar)  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've looked at the sources of the javadoc plugin and it won't generate anything if there's no java files matching  \n14:54\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n15:10\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:57\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0in 3.1, if you're logging into the main wiki in a farm, you're logged into all the virtual wikis.  \n16:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0JuanDaugherty: not sure what you mean  \n16:03\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0but logging out of a virtual doesn't log you out of the main, at least as admin. tmortagne, just trynna get clear on what's happening with sessions in a farm, presume this is only for admin accounts  \n16:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0JuanDaugherty: it's not exactly that, when you log in main wiki you put information in a cookie to log in automatically next time  \n16:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when you go to another wiki the cookie is read and you are automatically logged in  \n16:06\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0without user approval?  \n16:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0didn't you ticked \"remember me\" ?  \n16:07\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0convention is to ask  \n16:07\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0no ??????\u2019?  \n16:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0is it a domain based wiki farm or path based ?  \n16:09\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has quit  \n16:09\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0sorry xchat fucks up like that sometimes  \n16:10\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0it is domain based  \n16:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok then I'm not sure, maybe the cookie is set anyway  \n16:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0as far as I remember I usually have to reconnect to each wiki but it's maybe new in 3.1  \n16:11\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0you mean pre 3.2 don't you  \n16:12\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0because I never heard of xwikie before 3.1  \n16:12\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0\\*xwiki  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: seems something has changed because for me too I had to reconnect when going to subwikis. I even think that's the case on myxwiki.org  \n16:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0JuanDaugherty: Cookie domains  \n16:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Check xwiki.cfg  \n16:16\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0I always have that empty  \n16:19\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0(i.e. \"xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains=\" , not commented out )  \n16:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0What do you want? To disable logging in in all wikis at once, or to keep the global login but make logout work correctly?  \n16:34\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0logout does appear to work correctly  \n16:35\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0the bad thing would be if a non admin user of a subwiki was logged into another subwiki  \n16:36\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0don't care if admin user is logged into all, which does appear to be the case (though logout is honored)  \n16:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: Failing tests on platform  \n16:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: I know I just fixed it  \n16:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0K  \n17:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0guys, if the fix for \u00a0XWIKI-6754: Flickering Javascript errors and issues due to bad initialisation \u00a0at https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/6fbd314c7c23eeb15e29b35421b3a14b8605373b \u00a0is also fixing the issue with \"environment prevented table from loading data\" in the livetables, could we backport it to 3.1 as well?  \n17:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the livetable issue is \\_really\\_ annoying  \n17:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm packager build is broken in 3.1, that's weird  \n17:19\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha found another retro-compatibility bug with context user  \n17:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:28\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0is skin editor park of the enterprise pkg?
