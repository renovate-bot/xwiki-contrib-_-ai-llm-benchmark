'jsx' for instance  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when the shortcut leads to collisions you need to use the longer URL format  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's explained on the doc I pointed to)  \n14:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sounds ok for me  \n14:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0collisions are rare  \n14:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so subwiki:Main.WebHome ?  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll still need to decide how we want to handle subwikis  \n14:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh ok  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I'm implementing it only in the reference  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so website.com/xwiki/wiki:space.page  \n14:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or if you're deploying as ROOT: website.com/wiki:space.page :)  \n14:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's nice because if xwiki is the root webapp then it's really simple  \n14:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah that  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the nice thing is that to implement this new URL scheme I've just had to write 50 lines or code or so  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/or code/of code  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's only for the parsing part\u2026. ;)  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still need to tackle the serialization part...  \n14:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah and sometimes it's 1 line of code but days to find the right way to write it :|  \n14:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n15:09\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:21\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:04\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:15\u00a0<[d\\_\\_d]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:25\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n16:26\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:01\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:39\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0hello dear community!  \n17:40\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0can someone give me a hand and help to cfg xwiki to use an external mvn repo?
