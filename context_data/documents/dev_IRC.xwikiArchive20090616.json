This is why I prefer a lighter client that uses services instead of a heavy client potentially buggy dependencies.  \nflorinciu - (16/06/2009 23:37): (with)  \nsdumitriu left at 23:43 (\"Leaving.\")  \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:43): so you would like to make services for htmlcleaner and the converter?  \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:43): or to implement some new ones  \nflorinciu - (16/06/2009 23:48): I think the platform should have these services in a new xwiki 2.0 method set and new model. And I'm going to implement them. The issue is that i'm on a 30 days leave starting next week.  \nflorinciu - (16/06/2009 23:48): so if you are in a immediate need of these apis then I can't provide them  \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:49): well i can work at the GUI to improve it   \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:49): now it's not the best one  \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:49): but i don't think that it is enough for my evaluation  \nflorinciu - (16/06/2009 23:50): am still going to handle gsoc in that time. but i'm not going to heavily contribute on xoffice or the platform.  \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:50): yes, i see ..  \nflorinciu - (16/06/2009 23:52): if can you continue without the services, even with maven dependencies, please code it so that it can be easily changed in the future  \nflorinciu - (16/06/2009 23:52): as you should always do :)  \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:52): :) i know I know   \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:53): ok .. i will code with these dependencies (that ones from openoffice).. and i change after that   \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:54): about the service with the xwiki syntax .. a can hardcode it  \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:54): i don't know .. what do you suggest?  \nflorinciu - (16/06/2009 23:56): you can hardcode the syntax for now, use settings or what you tink is best. It's not a priority.  \nmarta\\_ joined #xwiki at 23:56  \ncristinas - (16/06/2009 23:57): ok ..  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 23:57  \nflorinciu - (16/06/2009 23:57): please ask some opinions on devs before adding platform dependencies  \ntrifon left at 23:59 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))  \n\n"}
