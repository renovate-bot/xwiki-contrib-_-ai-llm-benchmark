Basically any time you update/add/delete an xobject all the plugins are re-initialized. I've pinged thomas on skype (since comes from a recent modification he did). This is what makes the watchist test flicker (because of a concurrency with plugin reinit which makes the watchlist plugin not defined under some condition)  \n10:07\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n10:54\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:14\u00a0<jamesxu>\u00a0has quit  \n12:13\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:03\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n15:04\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:51\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:57\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
