 \nvmassol - (09:25): an object should always be associated with a document  \nDenis - (09:25): I use to set its wiki anyway, since in earlier version, it happens that this was not set properly or it may have been required by another piece of code.  \nvmassol - (09:25): newObject of createXObject should always set the document  \nvmassol - (09:26): and yes now the reference is absolute  \nvmassol - (09:26): (for document reference)  \nDenis - (09:26): BaseObject.getXClass().newObject() ?  \nvmassol - (09:26): (which is normal)  \nvmassol - (09:26): was talking about XWikiDocument apis  \nvmassol - (09:26): I don't even know about the method you mentioned :)  \nvmassol - (09:26): it should probably not even exist  \nvmassol - (09:27): since it does it means the user who calls it is in charge of setting the doc reference  \nvmassol - (09:27): all I'm saying is that all code that creates object  \nvmassol - (09:27): must set the doc reference  \nvmassol - (09:27): or things will break  \nvmassol - (09:27): s/will/may/  \nDenis - (09:28): BaseClass#newObject(XWikiContext) to be clearer  \nvmassol - (09:28): so yes  \nvmassol - (09:28): but  \nvmassol - (09:28): wait  \nvmassol - (09:28): if you have an object not added to a doc  \nvmassol - (09:28): then it means it doesn't exist as a doc object yet  \nvmassol - (09:28): then you add it to a doc  \nvmassol - (09:28): and then the doc ref is set at that time  \nxenon75 left at 09:28 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmassol - (09:28): so it should be fine  \nvmassol - (09:28): what's the pb?  \nxenon75 joined #xwiki at 09:28  \nDenis - (09:29): that before, I used to set its wiki, before adding it to a doc  \nvmassol - (09:30): you still can but it'll be removed  \nDenis - (09:30): I have at least one situation where doc association is done late, if I well remerber, it is for example during user registration, where the user object does not already has a doc  \nvmassol - (09:30): since an object \u00a0must always refer to its doc  \nvmassol - (09:30): when you add it to the doc, the doc will set itself as the doc ref for the object  \nvmassol - (09:30): at least that's how I understand it  \nDenis - (09:30): not, it NPE  \nvmassol - (09:30): what's the pb?  \nvmassol - (09:31): then you need to tell me which api you use so that I can check it?  \nvmassol - (09:31): s/?//  \nDenis - (09:32): BaseElement#setWiki(String) does a getDocumentReference() to store the wiki, and the reference is still null, as well as the name  \nmflorea left at 09:32 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:34): BaseClass.newObject and BaseClass.newCustomClassInstance seem not set any document name, however the database won't bother to store the object if it has no document.  \nvmassol - (09:35): Denis: ok will check later, you could open a jira issue though to remember it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:36): Any objections with making UnknownAction alter the action in the context?  \nDenis - (09:37): I will have to check myself anyway, be aware that this code was very buggy before, so mine had try to mitigate that, may be I can made my new code ligther, so let me check that for you. deeper, and I came back later with more information  \nvmassol - (09:38): CalebJamesDeLisl: I don't know enough to answer  \nvmassol - (09:38): Denis: have you seen the new refactoring for references thomas and I have done yesterday ? :)  \nvmassol - (09:38): (it's really powerful now)  \nDenis - (09:39): not yet  \nvmassol - (09:39): all the resolver impls now support an optional parameter which is a base reference to use (if specified)  \nDenis - (09:40): cool  \nvmassol - (09:40): if a default value for a type isn't found in it  \nvmassol - (09:40): then it uses the resolver's default  \nvmassol - (09:40): (current, default, etc)  \nDenis - (09:40): nice idea  \nDenis - (09:41): regarding, object and class reference, is there anything already ?  \nlucaa1 left #xwiki at 09:41  \nvmassol - (09:41): not sure what you mean  \nvmassol - (09:41): I'm coding a XClass resovler right now but that's for backward compat  \nvmassol - (09:41): (to transform a string into a relative ref, using \"XWiki\" if the space isn't specified)  \nDenis - (09:41): I thought you there were plan for object and class reference, no ?

 \nvmassol - (09:42): (we haven't any need yet really except for annotations)  \nDenis - (09:43): maybe, I just wonder how much it could impact what I will check today regarding objects  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:45): <off topic> This is why I love postgres... http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2006-03/msg01522.php  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 09:49  \nsilviar1 joined #xwiki at 09:49  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 09:50  \nsilviar left at 09:50 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 09:57  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:02  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:05): tmortagne: Good morning, do you know of any problem with changing web.UnknownAction so that it sets the action in the context to the default action as specified in xwiki.cfg?
