I just followed this page here http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationViaAPT , to install XWiki-tomcat7-postgresql on a completely clean Debian Wheezy installation. \u00a0Tomcat is running but when trying to run XWiki I get these types of errors: javax.servlet.ServletException: com.xpn.xwiki.XWikiException: Error number 3 in 0: Could not initialize main XWiki context  \n10:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Hi altker128: will need a more complete log, could you post it on pastebin or something like this  \n10:05\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0tmortagne: Yes, one second  \n10:06\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0tmortagne: http://pastebin.com/MVNmw8rq  \n10:07\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0tmortagne: The error looks similar to the one mentioned in the FreeBSD install guide (http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Drafts/BSD\\_Install/Error.png) (http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/BSD\\_Install) , but adding to the catalina file didn't help. \u00a0The error you see now is with the default tomcat7 config  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0altker128: what version of XWiki is this ?

 \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the mapping should be before the property  \n10:12\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0tmortagne: There are several properties followed by mappings ; do I just put all the mappings first?  \n10:13\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0props, mapping, propr, mapping  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm wait  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the opposite actually sorry  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0properties first  \n10:14\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0OK, that's what I figured :)  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the last property is not in the right place  \n10:14\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0Let me fix it  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fixing the issue on my side  \n10:15\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0OK, it pops up the distribution wizard :)  \n10:17\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0tmortagne: Going through the initial UI install  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0altker128: ok at least this specific issue should be fixed then  \n10:18\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0tmortagne: It feels like it's hung...but I'll give it more time  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0altker128: it's possible it takes some time the first time since it's gathering information from http://nexus.xwiki.org/  \n10:20\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0tmortagne: It feels like it's hung  \n10:20\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0Resolving extension dependency [org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-administration-ui-5.0.1] on namespace [xwiki]  \n10:20\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0altker128: sometimes it's because http://www.xwiki.org is not in a good shape but it seems ok right now  \n10:21\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0tmortagne: I'll leave it for a bit.  \n10:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the log is still on \"Resolving extension dependency [org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-administration-ui-5.0.1] on namespace [xwiki]\" ?

I am building an application in XWiki which has several modules inside it. In the master pom they are defined each using <module>. The problem is that I have to skip tests for one of the module, but only for a specified module. Is there a way to make the master pom skip the tests automatically for that module ?  \n18:40\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0sburjan`: Why the master pom?  \n18:41\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Just specify it in the module's pom  \n18:41\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0<properties><skipTests>true</skipTests></properties>  \n18:47\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0sdumitriu: works, thanks !
