 \nsdumitriu - (14:32): In platform/core/pom.xml, why do we declare both jmock-1.2 and 2.5 as test dependencies?  \nvmassol - (14:33): no idea, probably because both are used  \nvmassol - (14:33): if it can be slimmed down please go ahead  \nvmassol - (14:34): sdumitriu: will you have committed everything for 2.6RC2 before EOF today?  \nsdumitriu - (14:35): Hopefully  \nvmassol - (14:35): I won't be able to work over the week end  \nvmassol - (14:35): so if I have to do the release tomorrow I need to start early  \nsdumitriu - (14:35): I wanted to show what I have so far, but the router here has a crappy administration UI, I can't easily forward a port  \nvmassol - (14:35): so we need to ensure everything builds fine before EOF today  \nvmassol - (14:35): (build = build + tests)  \nvmassol - (14:38): sdumitriu: just received a mail :)  \nsdumitriu - (14:38): Yep, just sent it  \nsdumitriu - (14:38): WDYT?
