 \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if you download a XE zip it takes about 5mn  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you can execute it and import your modified page for ex  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's a jar you can copy it to WEB-INF/lib  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then you always have an XE instance around to test so you usually don't need to redownload, especially to test a page change  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not as bad as 6 hours :)  \n11:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, I just have a short attention span, if something takes more than a couple minutes I switch to something else  \n11:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0cjdns was written while xwiki compiled ;)  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you prefer to take other people's time  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's why I try to avoid core dev  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your 5mn has now taken 15mn of both our time  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ the 15 you'll need more to fix the problem and the 6 hours jenkins will require to rebuild all ;)  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0overall not a good choice!  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you're saying is that you prefer to code small libs, we all do, it's much simpler  \n11:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup  \n11:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and by knitting together small libs, you can make other small libs  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes xwiki  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's made of 100 of other libs knit together  \n11:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0global variables break this a bit  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: do I need to merge in 5.3?  \n11:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: yes  \n11:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm reasonably sure this is not me  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XWiki.Registration is working fine?  \n11:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, I registered a user  \n11:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-administration-test-tests/4721/testReport/junit/org.xwiki.administration.test.ui/AdministrationTest/verifyGlobalAndSpaceSections/ is something else  \n11:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and the text it's looking for in the test does seem to exist in my instance  \n11:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the change I made is so fantastically small, the only thing I could imagine it affecting is invitation  \n11:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0just confirmed adding a user via the admin interface as well  \n11:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:09\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Is there a Role I can implement to create a component which will be started up at xwiki's initialization?  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's a bit unfortunate  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ATM the only solution is to listent to ApplicationStartedEvent  \n12:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0err  \n12:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0how do you attach the listener?  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you implement EventListener  \n12:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh and you'll be registered automatically by the annotation loader?  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all components are registered through the annotation loader yes  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at startup)  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0registered is not the same as instantiated though  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0annotation loader will register  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ObservationManager will instantiate eventlisteners by looking them up  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0OM is explicitely called in XWikiServletContextListener  \n12:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh so I can use EventListener as a @Role ?  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(called = looked up + called)  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you need to listen to events yes  \n12:39\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0@Component public Cjd implements EventListener, Initializable { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0public void initialize() { System.out.println(\"hello world\"); } }  \n12:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0works?  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll need to impement getEvnets, getName and onEvent  \n12:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh, of course  \n12:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so if I implement onEvent I will get the event even though nothing explicitly called \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0observation.registerEvent()  \n12:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*registerEventListener() ?  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you implement the EventListener role you'll get called when an event matching your getEvents() appears  \n12:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok cool  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you'll get called = your onEvent() method)  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically ATM if you need to not lazily instantiate a component you'll need to go through a kind of factory pattern, the factory being an EventListener  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0said differently, our default is to lazily instantiate components ATM  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and whenever a module requires explicit init at startup time it implements an EventListener listening to ApplicationStartedEvent  \n12:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, I'm playing with a virt.x extension idea so that websocket related stuff doesn't have to be pulling teeth  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check the source code we have several  \n12:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so virt.x needs to startup at the beginning  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a011 to be precise  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually 10  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ExtensionApplicationStartedListener is an example of a listener there just to initialize another component at startup  \n12:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: any ideea if tmortagne will be available today ?  \n12:49\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0btw: just upgraded an existing test wiki to 5.0.3, and getting lots of exceptions from the solr indexer: \"multiple values encountered for non multiValued field class\". I guess this is just me messing up my test instance, however  \n12:49\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0er, upgraded from 5.0.3 to 5.3-rc-1 :-/ sorry  \n12:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ooo thankyou very much  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: I think you need to remove your solr index  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and restart xwiki  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know what mflorea planned to do for this, we talked about a migration to remove the solr index among other things  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/planned/is planning  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: is it in the release notes ATM?  \n13:02\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0vmassol: ah, ok, thanks, I just reindexed and thought that would fix the issue, but it didnt. now trying with the remove ...  \n13:04\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, removing the index from disk fixes this :)  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n13:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol, camil7: no automatic migration (i.e. removal of solr index) for the moment (not in 5.3 for sure). See http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki53RC1#HSolrSearchIndex  \n13:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: maybe we can be more precise in the RN about \" If you upgrade from a recent version\"  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to find the first release introducing Solr right?  \n13:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so we can say:  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"if you 've been using Solr\"  \n13:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0not good  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what cases does it miss?  \n13:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0because they may switch to sorl after the upgrade and it wouldn't work  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh  \n13:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0even if they didn't use solr, the idex was created  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed solr is used even if you don't use it in the UI  \n13:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so since the first release where we had solr  \n13:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's quite a lot of releases back  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a04.x  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a04.3  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a04.3M2 precisely  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki43M2  \n13:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first time it appears in the RN I believe  \n13:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0seems so, so we can say 4.3  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: let me know if my change is ok  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better be precise  \n13:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep, thanks, look good  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n13:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:08\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:41\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:55\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:12\u00a0<jtafurth|away>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<jtafurth|away>\u00a0is now known as <jtafurth>  \n15:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n15:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:21\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:28\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:32\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n16:00\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:14\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:23\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0creating XAFORUM jira project  \n16:25\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Hello, I have maybe a stupid question. But is it possible to link two xwiki instances which are running on two different server? Or maybe something like that a special subwiki is running on a separated server?  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0interwiki links maybe  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what you mean by \"link\"  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Kaisen)  \n16:30\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Idea behind is - I have a interla xwiki and I want a second which is accassable from external. But if I use the internal it can search in the external and I have access to it. But if I use the external one I cannot go on the internal one.  \n16:35\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Or in other words. If I have for example a developer xwiki and I want to use xwiki also for other users but I don't want that it is possible that normal users have access to the developer one but also the developer should not need to jump from one to the other wiki  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you've lost me but in short, no 2 instances are separate  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but xwiki is multitenant by default  \n16:36\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Yes I know  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you can access data from one wiki to another using the REST api or using interwiki links  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Kaisen: you should use a single isntance and 2 subwikis and play with rights  \n16:38\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Nothing against your software but if something went wrong than they have access to each other.  \n16:38\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0As the data on the same server if someone hack it he have also access to the other subwiki  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but looks very overkill, in any case it doesn' exist  \n16:39\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0But it is ok. You gave me the anser I'm looking for  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we had a project called P2P wiki in the past  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0aka concerto  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://concerto.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it stayed at a research level  \n16:40\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Ok.  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also at http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XWiki+Concerto  \n16:40\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0The Background is that I want to push xwiki in our company  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's a better link actually  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0source code is still there in case you're interesting in contributing to that to bring it back to life :)  \n16:41\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Problem is that we are a small IT department with no programming skills  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then it's going to be hard indeed :)  \n16:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0XWiki has features, features make attack surface.. if you're running a public facing page for a bank, you use the fewest lines of code possible and keep the JVM as far away from it as you can ;)  \n16:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but if you need features, that's not an option  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's complete bullshot  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all banks use java  \n16:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, you're right  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i know I participated to a lot of java designs for major banks in France  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for 10 years  \n16:42\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0What I want is to start with a internal xwiki instance for all our internal stuff  \n16:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's actually the bitcoin guys who have to worry because they can't just yank back a transfer :)  \n16:43\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0but we also have a lot of customers where we could use also xwiki to collaborate with them  \n16:43\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0But I want to prevent that a customer can access our internal stuff  \n16:43\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0so the idea is to use two xwikis  \n16:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a02 JVMs on 2 real VMs  \n16:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0is how I'd approach it  \n16:44\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0but if I than search something i need to do it in both to check if there is already a page/info  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Kaisen: for search it's easy  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I should say, shoudl be easy, I've never tried it :))  \n16:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0people on the inside wiki can search the one on the outside but not vice versa?  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can configure xwiki's SOLR search to use a separate solr search instance  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure how our UI handles that though  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0( http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8442 fyi)  \n16:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh vmassol, you'll love this story.. there were some high freq trade companies who wanted to use a java based platform, they ended up putting a few hundred k into development before they actually put it under load, it worked excellently until the GC kicked in and they started violating their SLAs  \n16:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so they ended up rewriting the GC and then they rewrote all of the structures in the program so they would collect faster  \n16:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0basically they write in in c.java  \n16:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*wrote  \n16:51\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0@\bvmassol\b If I get the Jira ticket right it is already imlemented and I can use it?  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Kaisen: yes  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't thin it's been tested so you'd be the first guinea pig  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*think  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:03\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Just read the short docu. If I understood it right I can just put the search extern but not that a search give results of to xwikis.  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know but you're probably right  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ?  \n17:04\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0What I need is something like a google search internally which checks both xwiki instance and I don't give the external access to that search - only to there internal xwiki search which have no access to the other  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: build is still failing\u2026 :(  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looking at it now, too bad you couldn't help  \n17:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<jtafurth>\u00a0is now known as <jtafurth|away>  \n17:12\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has quit  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok the result is that caleb broke it  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:(  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pretty easy to see: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/c76dd5b5e84f43395a14f82b907b4508f90526c8#diff-0  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grrrr  \n17:16\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0strange, I could not reproduce the problem ... at least not in the jetty-test instance locally :-/  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he added an #if without adding an #end  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actuallty the other way around  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0removed an #if without removing the #end  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he also didn't update the comment...  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm I think he committed only on master too  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but he said it was fixed in 5.3  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll fix jira only ATM  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm the #if is not on 5.3 branch  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the #end is not there too  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't get it  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my bad  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no it's ok, it's not on 5.3  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I hope it's ok now  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to go for 30mn, bbl  \n17:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so far so good: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/4732/  \n18:46\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:47\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:23\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:05\u00a0<jigar\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:07\u00a0<jtafurth|away>\u00a0is now known as <jtafurth>  \n20:32\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:36\u00a0<maxr\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<maxr\\_>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:51\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n21:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:32\u00a0<maxr\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:33\u00a0<maxr\\_>\u00a0Hi everyone.
