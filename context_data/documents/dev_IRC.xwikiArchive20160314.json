The webapp-name is something like \"my-xwiki\". I changed the xwiki.webapppath to \"my-xwiki/\" and also added an servlet-mapping from \"/my-xwiki/\\*\" to the action servlet. With IE everything works fine. With Firefox the first request of a page works fine, but in all following request \u00a0(loading .css, .js files) the URL encoding is wrong. The dash between \"my-xwiki\" is shown as \"  \n10:42\u00a0<pbert>\u00a0... the resource can't be found. Someone got an idea?  \n10:43\u00a0<pbert>\u00a0All encodings are set to UTF-8  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: reminds me of something, what version of XWiki are you using?  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not Pbas, pbert :)  \n10:44\u00a0<pbert>\u00a06.2  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah that\"s why probably  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember fixing an issue around this  \n10:44\u00a0<pbert>\u00a0:-)  \n10:45\u00a0<pbert>\u00a0do you remember the fix? can i patch it myself on the old version, or do i have to update?  \n10:45\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found it  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11401  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it wasn't about a dash, it was about underscore...  \n10:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe the fix would help, I don't know  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case you should try upgrading to at least 6.4.8 (or 7.4.2 if you wish to benefit from Nested Spaces)  \n10:49\u00a0<pbert>\u00a0hmm... thx a lot ... i will update to the latest 6.x and have look ...

I thought the 'xwiki:'-prefix should be present for global users, at least ....  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0acotiuga: as ClemensR suggested, if the user in the group does not have the wiki part then it cannot be from main wiki anyway  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless you are checking in main wiki itself  \n14:22\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Well, I'm iterating the list of users from a group from the main wiki being in a subwiki and I get the users without wiki id like XWiki.Administrator and $xwiki.exists(XWiki.Administrator) is false while $xwiki.exists(xwiki:XWiki.Administrator)  \n14:22\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0What I'm trying to say is that I would need the second form  \n14:22\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0\\* while $xwiki.exists(xwiki:XWiki.Administrator) \u00a0is true  \n14:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, you got the group from the main wiki  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0acotiuga: set($memberReference = $services.model.resolveDocument($groupMember, $groupDocument.documentReference.wikiReference)  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that will give you the complete reference of the group member no matter what  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then you can use $xwiki.exist($memberReference)  \n14:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0actually the page author information is stored that way, i.e. by absolute path and that ... can be a problem if moving pages between wikis...  \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: you mean in the history ? because the move is supposed to update author in the current version  \n14:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(please ignore me, I am just unconstructively chattering around ;)  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0acotiuga: actually a bit simpler:  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0#set($memberReference = $services.model.resolveDocument($groupMember, $groupDocument.documentReference)  \n14:29\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0thanks  \n14:31\u00a0<jzhang>\u00a0has quit  \n15:02\u00a0<jzhang>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:04\u00a0<jzhang>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<avisser>\u00a0I want to look at your code so much, that I broke down and installed the maven plugin for IntelliJ.

Selenium is the thing that I've not played with, but can learn it.  \n17:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0sounds good  \n17:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0don`t worry, there`s plenty to choose from, unit tests or functional ones :)  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you wouldn't be interested in fixing flickering tests by any chance? :) (just kidding)  \n17:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0heh, that would be the BOSS level of the summer :)  \n17:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you`ve mentioned that you`re employed  \n17:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0will you be working during the summer, besides GSoC?  \n17:51\u00a0<lokeshw24>\u00a0Yeah. I believe I'm good at unit tests, having worked on it in gsoc last year + I've written Junit tests during my job. So I would love to have mixture of both : unit + functional(for challenge)  \n17:51\u00a0<lokeshw24>\u00a0No no. I \"was\" working. Now I'm a student - doing my masters.  \n17:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n17:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that`s good, since having both a job and doing a GSoC can be problematic  \n17:52\u00a0<lokeshw24>\u00a0yes ofcourse :)  \n17:52\u00a0<lokeshw24>\u00a0vmassol: Sorry didn't get what exactly you meant by \"flickering\" test. But sounded interesting.  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lokeshw24: don't worry I was joking  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have tests that fail from time tom time and they're becoming a pain  \n17:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0is there a technica term for flickering tests ?  \n17:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0a.k.a. \"flaky tests\" :)  \n17:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm  \n17:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok cool thanks  \n17:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, cjd, apparently \"flaky\" is the \"correct\" word to use  \n17:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0lokeshw24: so I guess you`ve read the project description  \n17:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I wrote a project proposal that says we're going to work on our flakey tests  \n17:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and you can have a look over this mail thread where I`ve already replied to a student previously asking about the same project http://markmail.org/message/fk5kqvkpjjn5bldf  \n17:54\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Hope y'all don't mind that I committed a bit of your time to that :)  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: project proposal = research project?  \n17:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n17:57\u00a0<lokeshw24>\u00a0Enygma`: Thanks, was about to ask the same thing. Now reading the mail.  \n17:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Seems the answer is just to eliminate all sources of randomness such as clocks and multi-core so that the jvm is running in a perfectly repeatable VM  \n18:03\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: that won't fully work  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because there are a lot of randmoness  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the xwiki code itself changes  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the jvm changes  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for ex when moving to java8 locally lots of tests started failing because they were wrongly written - for ex the tests expected a given order for lists and this was changed)  \n18:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you run it on a single core machine where the clock is hard-wired to the processor steps and memory access and IO is guaranteed to take a given number of processor cycles (and the processor is paused if it actually takes more)  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and jenkins changes too  \n18:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0then there is no source of randomness which can leak in to the machine  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway if you were able to remove randmon you'd have a portion of the tests always failing (and working on your machine)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you'd need to fix them anyway :)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(a flickering tests is a wrongly written test)  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I prefer to address the issue by making our test fwk less subject to flickering  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0simplelenium for example does that  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(http://blog.javabien.net/2014/04/15/simplelenium-writing-robust-tests-with-selenium/)  \n18:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well... they're a little bit bullshitting there because selenium tests are not and cannot be robust but indeed there are tricks to push the limit down  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey don't call my friend bulllshit :)  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I actually spent an hour discussing it with David and he has some good points that I've been wanting to integrate in our fwk  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so yes it's always about pushing the limit down  \n18:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't like when you take a very unstable platform, make it less unstable and then call it stable, that's all  \n18:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Can't find much literatire about time-deterministic vms  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure I follow you. Selenium is stable  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's how you use it that can be unstable)  \n18:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Ok maybe wrong word, selenium tests are prone to flakyness  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well selenium is transparent  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it does what the browser does  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0simplelenium is about helping by making the writer forced to address issue of wait  \n18:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's an api designed to force all calls to wait on something basically  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same intent as our fwk  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0execpt we should improve ours a bit  \n18:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0lokeshw24: I`m off for today.
