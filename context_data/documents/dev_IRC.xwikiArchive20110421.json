I'm just asking if it's desired behaviour that we should keep or not.

I'll try to get online to look at them (maybe before the release) but I cannot guarantee anything  \n18:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0revert my commit if needed, I will put it back when I come back  \n19:00\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<chanikag>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Can you help me with some architecture questions?  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I have an interface, which can be implemented by different classes  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0These classes need to access other components, so I'd like to use @Inject on some fields  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0At the same time, they need to be passed a certain value, ideally in their constructor  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I also have a factory that can be used to instantiate them  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So, I can see two options so far:  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a01. Make them components, and add a package-private setter which can be used by the factory  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a02. Make them simple classes (since they don't need to be components, the factory is the better way to instantiate them) and pass the required components in the constructor  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Is 2 the right approach? Do you see any other options?  \n19:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03 make the component per lookup and have a setter to set the fields  \n19:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not saying it's better)  \n19:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just listing all options)  \n19:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(3 removes the need for a factory)  \n19:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know what's best, it depends what you need to set  \n19:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I need the factory  \n19:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you really need it then 2 sounds good  \n19:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And I'd like the setter to be unaccessible to the outside code  \n19:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's similar to entity references  \n19:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just move the code in internal package  \n19:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want external code to access it  \n19:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/want/don't want/  \n19:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0(it is internal already)  \n19:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, thanks  \n19:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:31\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n21:23\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:28\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:36\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:36\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:44\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n22:17\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n22:18\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n22:56\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:25\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has quit  \n23:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
