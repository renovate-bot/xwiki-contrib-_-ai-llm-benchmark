I was going for RSS macro because from a user POV, the RSS macro is affected :) ok, modifying the desc \u00a0to colibri  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can keep it from a user POV I'm fine with that  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just pick the right jira component  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so for me it's ok to keep the same title  \n16:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I know they are in diferent modules, but I though that ifa user searches jira, he will search for RSS not for Colibri  \n16:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: opdated the component to Colibri skin  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I agree with you  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see \"http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI/component/10022\"  \n16:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0refresh :)  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ok now :)  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0perfect  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now the question is why we put this in the colibri css....  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie whether changing it will break something else)  \n16:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, so I removed the width because we shouldn't have any hardcoded width because the layout can change 1,2,3,4 columns  \n16:52\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I don't know what else could use :.rssfeed { class  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it means that now by default when you use the rss macro in a page it'll take the full width?  \n16:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0seems so, now it breaks this usecase :)  \n16:55\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0(thinking), but without adding a width param (optional) I don't see any other solution  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK in standard HTML only the width needed is used  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I'll let you work on this issue  \n16:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes but this look very bad in dashboard.  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the user can use width=100%  \n16:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so you're ok with it ? removeing that line and make user specify width fomr WYSIWYG ?  \n17:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, you're right. \u00a0I understand now  \n17:06\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone has any idea why the activity stream on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News isn't working?  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's only listing entries from the main wiki  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the code uses:  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{activity entries=\"50\" wikis=\"\"xwiki,platform,enterprise,manager,extensions,dev,watch,xeclipse,xoffice,contrib\" rss=\"true\"/}}  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I see a double suote used  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*quote  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0much better :)  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: would be nice if you had an avatar on xwiki.org ;)  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(would display better on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News )  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(same for Enygma`)  \n17:36\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: ok, I will have to find something, I have to put an avatar on a lot of places :)  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the future, would be nice to allow supporting gravatar in the AS  \n17:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0+1 for that.  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I can do that already  \n17:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0one avatar to update all :)  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can run my script  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to take a long time, I should restrict it to committers group probably initially  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm reffering to http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Gravatar+Import  \n17:39\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I guess if we want to integrate gravatar support in platform, we'll need to add a checkbox on user profile page. something like. Use my uploaded page/User my gravatar pic  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0although in the future it would be best to query gravatar and not hardcode it  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok we new have an avatar for our irc bot ;)  \n17:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0\u00a0vmassol: Did you create the IRCBot user?  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0feel free to update its avatar image if you find a better one  \n17:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0a darth vader image :D  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you see the bot negatively? :)  \n17:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0then a Yoda image ? :)  \n17:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I see that JIRA doesn;t support gravatar :)  \n17:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: you now have a nice avatar ;)  \n18:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: thanks :D I'm gonna use it on skype also :P  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0err please no  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not for skype  \n18:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0although I don't know what creature is that :D  \n18:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok got to go now, bb tomorrow  \n18:06\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0have a nice evening :)  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thks  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0is now known as <Guest76479>  \n18:55\u00a0<Guest76479>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:59\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:08\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n21:43\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:19\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:22\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:22\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan`>  \n22:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n23:06\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:08\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n23:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
