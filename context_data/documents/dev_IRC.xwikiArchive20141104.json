 \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: works well for me in myxwiki.org (6.2.2)  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you have the issue in master ?  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm on master  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds like a regression  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's confirm first  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0testing on latest 6.3-SNASHOT  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the one from this morning at least  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: no issue for me, I get my parent  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll restest a bit later, thanks  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're in wiki syntax right?  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you create a wanted link  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[[label>>somethingnotexisting]]  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I edit with wiki editor and put [[child]] as content  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then I save and click on it  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:21\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: yup, there are multiple LDAP servers, one user is member of group that is described in different LDAP server  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you using the standard LDAP authenticator ?  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(since it does not support several LDAP servers)  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I must have done something wrong because it's ok too now, sorry for the false alert  \n14:23\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0no really, a little modified one... but the main code is the same one... the only part i need is to obtain values from field \"memberOf\", which seems to return empty set when using ldaputils.searchUserAttributesByUid  \n14:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so this is a Java question on how to use XWikiLDAPUtils ?  \n14:24\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup  \n14:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you want to get the fields named \"memberOf\" of the a user entry ?  \n14:25\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yes  \n14:26\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0(because they contain the groups user is member of)  \n14:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0let me see, you will probably have to use directly XWikiLDAPConnection  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ldaputils.searchUserAttributesByUid is getting only the fields declared in the configuration for user sync I think  \n14:27\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0well, it has an extra attribute (fields to obtain), so i just might be using it wrong  \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking, long time I did not used that :)  \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed you are right that should do it  \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0how do you call it ?  \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe the you did not set the right user uid attribute  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0how did you get the XWikiLDAPUtils instance ?  \n14:29\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ha, yes, it's working correctly, damn closures in groovy :)  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n14:30\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ok, so this should solve it :) thanks  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0np, always good to explain what you did to someone who lost memory of how the API was supposed to work :)  \n14:39\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n14:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seriously, ClassSheetBinding comes from a XAR...  \n14:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we are create lots of mandatory class which contains an object of this class for most of them and it's not even generated  \n14:50\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n14:51\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:52\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:52\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n14:54\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Hi Guys, on contrib documentation we actually list two convention for naming project, which are application-\\* and macro-\\*, but we actually want to publish an extension to allow panels to be collapsed. This is neither an application, nor a macro, actually this is a JSX activated wiki wide\u2026 which naming should we follow ?  \n14:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol ?  \n15:01\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good question, looks like something real small, it's a one page app without visible UI?  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I guess what we call app is a set of wiki pages with a UI  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0macro isn't an app because it has no user UI  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the nomenclature is not very good ATM  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: would be great if you could list a few examples of the pages missing in XWIKI-11383  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I vaguely remember some discussions on thelist but I'm not sure  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0brb  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm debugging the nullpointer for now (but as I indicated the nullpointer happen after the actual import)  \n15:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: I will try to remember what I saw  \n15:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: perfectly, it is a single page, with a JMX, and I have suggested to not put it in a separate space, but in the XWiki space to benefit of the access rights given there, as a hidden document  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: does not have to be all of them but at least one so that I know were to put a breakpoint since the log does not really contains much  \n15:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: I added some stuff, but I don't remember exactly what was missin  \n15:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0g  \n15:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne, lucaa: just commented the issue  \n15:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I didn't even investigate too much to get details. The import had thrown exception so until I had the import right I would not investigate other stuff because it didn't make sense for me  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: this was done with user having admin right when it started the import, I agree that this is not a very common use case but there is no reason to get missing pages  \n15:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0if you loose the rights, it could really happen, it is not wise to cut your right under your own foot  \n15:14\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0it is by design IMO  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: the fact that you had issue could have been just because of documents author not having PR  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not missing documents  \n15:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: once the import is started it does not test any right anymore  \n15:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm not sure. aren't those docs imported with the user from the package  \n15:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0?  \n15:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0reallly  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the import is not written in Velocity  \n15:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: also, sure, for macros sure. But how about user profile?  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is a test to see if you can import and that's all  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: I don't know  \n15:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but what is sure if that you can get UI issue with document not registered with the proper rights (translations for example), no need to have missing documents for this  \n15:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0Denis: you don't know that you're cutting the branch under your feet, you're importing standard distribution from the XWiki website. also, it used to be the case before DW, this is how you'd install XWiki, it was working and you'd get a message at the end. Why change that to worse?  \n15:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: iirc it was more than translations, like missing sheets & all  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe user sheet need PR for some reason  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm not really the expert here  \n15:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: maybe, but should we try to figure that out?  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but without an actual missing document the only bug I can see is the one with the import report generation  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I will work on this one for now  \n15:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0also, community, don't forget that thjere is a beautiful class caller XWiki,RequiredRights which you can add to a document to mark that it needs programming rights...  \n15:19\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0\\*called  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: I can try to figure out a bug sure, but right now I'm not even sure there is actually missing documents  \n15:20\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n15:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: did you try the case?  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I know for sure that some document don't have the proper right like you always have when you import this big all in one XAR  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0whatever user you use  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: I did try and the only thing i'm sure is that the report fail  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again you can't have perfect UI right after all in one XAR import, there is another jira issue about that  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is because some document are imported before their author and things like this  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but when you restart it should be ok  \n15:21\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:24\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: did you used \"Import as backup package\" or not ?  \n15:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I don't remember  \n15:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Import as backup package\" use the author from the XAR  \n15:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when saving documents  \n15:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is usually what you want in a case like this  \n15:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it does not seems to be ticked by default  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you don't remember I guess you did not used it, so all wiki macros, jsx, translations, etc were saved with an author not having admin right  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that could explain the issue you had  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the graphical issues you had  \n15:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n15:41\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:43\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0https://groups.google.com/a/xwiki.com/forum/#!aboutgroup/research  \n16:24\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Wrong chat, sorry  \n16:50\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: I commented on XWIKI-11383 with info from a local test I just did  \n16:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: ok thanks, I answered one of your question  \n16:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I will change the issue title to talk about the nullpointer  \n16:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:02\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: here's an easy one for you http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11390 :)  \n17:45\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Enygma`: thx  \n18:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:38\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:48\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:28\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:55\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:07\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:16\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n21:01\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:51\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:17\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:20\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:30\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit\n"}
