 \n08:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a012!!  \n08:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which was already 1 week after the planned date  \n08:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow  \n08:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're really bad  \n08:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0what's the point of releasing today? it's almost like renaming M1 in RC1  \n08:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n08:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what' wrong with that?  \n08:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not how it works marius  \n08:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're not trying to stuff things  \n08:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're supposed to do time boxing  \n08:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the onyl reason NOT to release  \n08:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is because of a blocking issue  \n08:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the question is: how many of blocking issues do we have?  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and RC is supposed to not have anything  \n08:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, but cannot ignore the fact that we has holidays and no so much activity, so planning releases around those dates was not a good idea,  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I really don't get it  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not about maount of work  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not about holidays  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's about time boxing  \n08:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm not surprised it got postponed  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has nothing at all to do with amount of work  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0absolutely nothing  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's the opposite  \n08:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the less people the easier it is to release  \n08:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because there are less things and thus less chance to break thinfs  \n08:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0things  \n08:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0doing releases is not a goal in itself, I know we do timeboxing, but we should have something to timebox.  \n08:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it is  \n08:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's THE goal in itself  \n08:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we do have things  \n08:35\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'll send a mail to see what the rest thing. if they agree to release today, I'll do it.  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you cannot do timeboxing and feature-based releases at the same time, they are opposite  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we need to know  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is what are the blockers today  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remmeber seeing thomas and denis talking about a big issues last friday  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then we have failing tests that we need to fix too  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO we should aim to fix the blocking + tests today  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to be able to release tomorrow  \n09:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0any idea why last watchlist mail is in russian ?  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've noticed that too, no idea  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: we were discussing the RC1 release with mflorea earlier.  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we have a blocking or can we release?  \n09:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep seen that  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*blocker  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember denis raised an issue Friday  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't know the status on it  \n09:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis found an important issue with Tomcat that I have on my xwiki-debug-eclipse setup too which make XWiki unusable  \n09:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's a very weird issue  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have we been able to track what commit introduced it?  \n09:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I tough is was caused by Eclipse si I did not digged much but \u00a0since Denis have the same issue...  \n09:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not really  \n09:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0can't even tell what is the issue  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok is that something you could look at today?  \n09:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like a tomcat internal multithread issue from what I seen  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other blocker we have are functional tests. Some of us need to work on fixing them today. I can help. I'd need help from others too  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any other known blocker?  \n09:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I would like to finish XWIKI-7384, there is not much left to do (mark an imported extension as imported to display an \"update\" button, match extension authors with existing users the wiki and make the download button usable with this kind of extensions)  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the release date for RC1 was 12th of Jan. We're the 16th\u2026 IMO we need to release ASAP. We should put ourselves in release mode: fix failing tests, fix blocking issues  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ASAP = tomorow probably  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need the time to fix blocker + tests  \n09:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n09:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but the tomcat issue seems to be a tricky one, can't promise anything for tomorow  \n09:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's a blocker for sure  \n09:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea, vmassol: XWIKI-7400  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0setting fix for  \n09:48\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to find why http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News doesn't have the AS anymore  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0really weird\u2026 the content has the AS macro  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I change the content to just {{activity entries=\"50\" wikis=\"xwiki,platform,enterprise,manager,extensions,dev,xeclipse,xoffice,contrib,commons,rendering\"/}} and preview it works fine  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually even without changing the content, just clicking preview works fine  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it seems to be some view cache  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just checked, rendering cache is not enable in xwiki.properties  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bb in 10mn  \n10:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:14\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n10:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n10:50\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r09d22c0\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-rest/src/test/it/org/xwiki/test/rest/WikisResourceTest.java :\u000f Fix failing test. - http://git.io/yzEaKw  \n10:53\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Vincent Massol\u000f master\u000f \\* r1d39e75\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-test/src/main/java/org/xwiki/test/integration/XWikiTestSetup.java :\u000f XE-1088: Ensure that functional tests don't go out on the internet when going to the Extension Manager UI pages ...  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope didn't work...  \n11:05\u00a0<xipe\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<xipe\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: do we take screenshots when a selenium 2 test fails?

 \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I'm just triying that  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0btw it's better to get used to use $services.wikimanager  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok using that  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0even if both should work unless you installed it used EM  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes I know  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/used/using/  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not registered in the list of plugins in xwiki.cfg  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool works now, thanks for the help  \n19:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but since I changed all the code I could find with $xwiki.wikimanager it's not obvious  \n19:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there used to be an error displayed in wikimanager UI when the plugin was not there  \n19:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but now the error is based on $services.wikimanager  \n19:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r924bad0\u000f \u000f/ (18 files in 18 dirs):\u000f Not all the distributions have the same dependencies - http://git.io/jSdL1w  \n19:22\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r0b6cef9\u000f \u000f/ (3 files in 3 dirs):\u000f Not all the distributions require the same dependencies - http://git.io/ls7v4w  \n19:23\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n20:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:56\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:23\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r3c3bb14\u000f \u000f/ (4 files in 2 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7406: Use new install/uninstall plan in the EM UI - http://git.io/Mi\\_1EA  \n22:58\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r0a85075\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-extension/xwiki-platform-extension-repositories/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-xwiki/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-xwiki-server-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/extension/repository/xwiki/internal/resources/AbstractExtensionRESTResource.java :\u000f XWIKI-7384: Provide UI to import and synchronize an external extension ...  \n23:40\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:53\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n23:54\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
