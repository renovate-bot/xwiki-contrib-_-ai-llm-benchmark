 \n08:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: XRENDERING-297 add new feature to an already supported markdown syntax  \n08:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the table says 3.4 for markdown 1.0  \n08:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you need 3.4+  \n08:34\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I'm on 5.1, so almost md 1.1 syntax  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rebooting (yeah even on mac you reboot from time to time ;))  \n08:36\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Next question - how do I enable it?

 \n08:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0PageEditing is part of the user guide while AdminGuide.Configuration is part of the admin guide (admins decide the syntax accepted on their wikis)  \n08:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if that's what you meant)  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rebooting!  \n08:44\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0k  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n08:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:45\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0heh. rendering.xwiki.org talks about 5.2 features, but is running 5.1  \n08:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:49\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0yay. our xwiki has an uptime of 321 days.  \n08:49\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I'm tempted to update to latest version (now at 5.1) just wondering if that will cause the link between xwiki and tomcat to break again - or something else ...  \n08:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n08:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Inge-, : 5.2 is not out yet  \n08:56\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0AHA!  \n08:56\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I've been thinking I'm living in such a cave, but I'm actually on the latest production version. fair enough :)  \n08:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:00\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0When is 5.2 expected to be released?

So I'll try again now ...  \n10:20\u00a0<npst>\u00a0I have configured my server with apache, kerberos and xwiki 4.1.3  \n10:20\u00a0<npst>\u00a0all requests that xwiki sends via javascript (loading of attachment-area, displaying users ...) get's a 401:forbidden, as firebug tells me  \n10:21\u00a0<npst>\u00a0i did already try to allow localhost in the apache settings  \n10:21\u00a0<npst>\u00a0do you have any idea where i could start to solving this?  \n10:23\u00a0<npst>\u00a0(maybe requesting those contents with ht elogged-in user would be a solution. but i don't know how to do this)  \n10:24\u00a0<npst>\u00a0\\*the logged  \n10:39\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n10:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0npst: I don't understand what this has to do with localhost, javascript calls are done from the client so it's should behave exactly as if the user had entered these links himself in the browser  \n10:41\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:41\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n10:41\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n10:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the browser end up calling http://localhost... links then you issue is more about links generation than authentication  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if that's your issue it probably mean you did not properly configured apache->tomcat proxy  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(tomcat or whatever app server you are using)  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we are generally using mod ajp in apache  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you have to go through a blind HTTP proxy where XWiki can only see localhost as input you can force a domain in the main wiki descriptor (/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiServerXwiki page)  \n10:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:57\u00a0<npst>\u00a0you're right, of course, the browser is not calling localhost.  \n11:00\u00a0<npst>\u00a0but only some of the requests I see in apaches access.log contain my username, others none at all  \n11:01\u00a0<npst>\u00a0maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot. Fact is, those POST and GET requests get a 401 error  \n11:27\u00a0<npst>\u00a0ok. it seems as if the request without username is expected behaviour and always followed by a request WITH credentials.  \n11:27\u00a0<npst>\u00a0however, those requests never get a result, as opposed to when i manually try to open that link. (then i get a nice result set of i.e. xwiki users)  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0sburjan: fixed, a bit hacky but couldn't find a better solution  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n11:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: note I haven't tested on MySQL  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but this problem won't appear on mysql)  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you can get others though)  \n11:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I see the fix is quite complex  \n11:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: btw this means you guys didn't test a migration since 4.5.3  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(on postgresql/oracle)  \n11:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0maybe  \n11:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it was a long time ago  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not very good  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0migrations need to be tested before each major release  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this problem is there since 4.5.4 included  \n11:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yepp  \n11:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I'll retest migrations after RC1 is out  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0please test before  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after RC1 is too late already  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it gives us little margin to fix any issue  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think marius is working on a fix for the DW  \n11:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I'll test tomorrow  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO you should retest just after that fix  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes tomorrow is good  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks!  \n11:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes but I also need some margin to do my tests  \n11:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0np  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you've got all night and week end! :) ahahah  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(kidding)  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's hope you get enough time  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not we might want to delay the release  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since so far migrations have failed for workspaces  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we need that to work well  \n11:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well some aspects during the migration failed, indeed.
