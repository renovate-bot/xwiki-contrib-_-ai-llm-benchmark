I thought something does it intentionally  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no there is no scheduler about removing history and we really don't want to remove history anyway because we do stats on it  \n17:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0not sure about it, just wondering if there is something \"cleaning up\" intentionally, because some users asked be of a feature like this. Seems I misunderstood an accident an a feature ;)  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe there is something on extensions.xwiki.org  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like in the admin tool  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Remove old history to make room\" or something like this  \n17:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1: ok, if DocumenTree is not found in the subwiki, and only available on the main wiki, then it is somewhat a \"bug\" that it uses the document tree in edit view form the main wiki  \n17:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: there are the admin tools for the recycle bin, but they only work on mysql; nothing found to delete old versions, the closest is \u00a0\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Display+documents+having+several+versions \u00a0(which is a starting point in any case)  \n17:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0So to recap: In edit mode, I see the /XWiki/DocumentTree in my Network on firefox, but in normal mode I don't, and tree-finder.js gets error 404  \n17:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1: \u00a0maybe you can try to export the page \u00a0XWiki.DocumentTree from the main wiki and import it into the subwiki?  \n17:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and see if that fixes things?  \n17:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0How would one go about doing that?  \n17:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0go to the XWiki/DocumentTree in the main wiki (assuming you are admin there) and Use \"Export\" -> \"Export as XAR\"  \n17:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0then use the \"Import\" section of the wiki administration in the subwiki to import the page  \n17:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: agh, I see you meant: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Remove+Document+History \u00a0thanks! did use the wrong keywords for search :)  \n17:22\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0Sorry ClemensR, i'm having a bit of trouble following  \n17:22\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0Is XWiki/DocumentTree the gadget?
