A simple way to determine the reference is to look at the address (URL) of the page you want to include/display and take the part to the right of \"/bin/view/\" (.e.g \"Main/WebHome\") and replace \"/\" with \".\". Also note that if the address ends with a \"/\", you have to replace that with \".WebHome\", e.g. \"/bin/view/Main/\" -> \"Main.WebHome\"  \n17:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0while \"/bin/view/Main/SomethingElse\" translates to \"Main.SomethingElse\" (no \"/\" at the end of the address, so no need for \".WebHome\" at the end)  \n17:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it`s a bit non-intuitive for the moment and we are considering adding some easy ways in the UI to get the reference, but until then, you should be able to manage with the above process  \n17:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0additionally, if you want to reference a page that is located on another subwiki (or from a subwiki to the main wiki), you have to prefix the reference with the wiki name, e.g. \"xwiki:Main.WebHome\" (main wiki's homepage) vs \"someWiki:Main.WebHome\" (homepage of \"someWiki\").  \n17:05\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0Enygma`, thank's for your reply it's work perfectly.  \n17:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0;)  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0floflobel: there's also a FAQ entry about this: https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/How+can+I+get+the+reference+of+a+page  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@Eny  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma: you may want to update that page with the info you created above ;)  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think your answer details the second bullet point of that FAQ entry  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure since detailing will mean maintenance work when the format changes  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe the link to the standartd url format is good enough actually  \n17:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:12\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's even more complete  \n17:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n17:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: will consider that on Monday  \n17:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n17:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:31\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0Is it possible to hide a name of gadget on Dashboard ?  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0floflobel: you mean not have a title?  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you use an empty title what do you get?  \n18:13\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0vmassol, yes the title is empty, thank's :)  \n19:17\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:51\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has quit  \n20:50\u00a0<Ebere\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:50\u00a0<Ebere\\_>\u00a0hello everyone  \n20:52\u00a0<Ebere\\_>\u00a0am new here... i will like to be a contributor to the projects here... can anyone put me through???  \n20:59\u00a0<Ebere\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n21:07\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Ebere\\_: hi  \n21:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool!  \n21:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could get some ideas about the various ways to contribute by checking out http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Contributing  \n22:31\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n23:43\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
