 \n17:45\u00a0<qwebirc87138>\u00a0do you know how the space and groups are connected?  \n17:45\u00a0<qwebirc87138>\u00a0if that query would have better performances  \n17:45\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0groups are xwiki objects and spaces are \"virtual\" namespaces for documents  \n17:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:46\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0a space is just the part of the document name before the \".\", you don't need to use mkdir and rmdir to create and remove spaces.  \n17:46\u00a0<qwebirc87138>\u00a0I see  \n17:47\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0checking permissions on a space is done by checking the XWikiGlobalRights objects in the WebPreferences document in that space  \n17:47\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0if there is no such document or it has no applicable rights objects, it defers to the permissions for the whole wiki.  \n17:48\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0So if you make some assumptions like \"no deny permissions means everyone can view it\" AKA: \"all groups have permission to view on the wiki level\" then it can be simplified.  \n17:48\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Also you would want to assume that groups are not members of other groups because if they are, the query is recursive  \n17:50\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:50\u00a0<qwebirc87138>\u00a0has quit  \n17:51\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0sorry got disconnected  \n17:51\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0I'll make that assumption  \n17:51\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0so given a page  \n17:51\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0I could check for the global rights of its space  \n17:52\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0yes  \n17:52\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0but still.. could you help me by querying the group having read access to a given space ?  \n17:53\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0I was able to do it the other way around, like given the spaces, check if the user has access to it..  \n17:53\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0hmm I think there's a function for this  \n17:53\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0but I cannot retrieve the list of groups having read access to a given space  \n17:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0using the permissions system is faster than asking the database because a lot of this information is cached.  \n17:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:56\u00a0<qwebirc21732>\u00a0I'll investigate further tomorrow, but thanks for your time cjd  \n17:57\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0sure thing  \n17:58\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0pulasthi: http://178.32.188.9:8080/ <-- still very broken but running entirely on cassandra  \n17:58\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0performance results are encouraging  \n18:00\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PID USER \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PR \u00a0NI \u00a0VIRT \u00a0RES \u00a0SHR S %CPU %MEM \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME+ \u00a0COMMAND  \n18:00\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjd: cool, it loaded pretty quickly even with the fact that i am connected through my phone  \n18:00\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a022603 wikinode \u00a020 \u00a0\u00a00 1056m 388m \u00a021m S \u00a0\u00a0\u00a00 \u00a07.6 \u00a0\u00a01:05.85 java  \n18:01\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0388M of ram is not horrible, I would really like to drive it down further  \n18:01\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ofc in a lot of cases, the standard library is your enemy :(  \n18:03\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0mmm gotta setup another one so I can kill them one at a time to reinstall and cassandra will shift the data over  \n18:04\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:04\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjd: hmm its seems you've been working on this a lot :)  \n18:05\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Most of it was done over the summer, I just had to revamp the design and get a better understanding of how DN and Cassandra actually works  \n18:20\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjd: cool, it seems you will be able to finish it soon :)  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0heh porting all of the functions and features over is a one-by-one project  \n18:21\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0soon, we'll have a base to build on  \n18:23\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ahh  \n18:26\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0anyway its come a long way  \n18:26\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjd: i have to go, catch you later :)  \n18:28\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0see ya  \n18:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:49\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:43\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0hi sdumitriu :)  \n19:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi vishnu  \n19:44\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0I'm back, this time succesfully tracing out the error :D  \n19:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Any luck?
