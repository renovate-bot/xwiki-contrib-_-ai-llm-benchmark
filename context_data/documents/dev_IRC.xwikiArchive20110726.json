 \n08:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think python and ruby macros should work a lot better than php one  \n08:37\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0Gliffy has a rest api  \n08:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ruby at least, pythong one is a bit slow  \n08:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:37\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0and then two client libs to make life easier  \n08:37\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0for php and java  \n08:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so you can use java one with groovy scripting  \n08:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which is what is workking the best after velocity  \n08:39\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0right, i am trying to use, at least initially, those languages, i have some experience with, to ease the learning curve -- so java and php, would be useful,  \n08:39\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0(mostly in recent times i programmed in vb.net)  \n08:40\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i understand that velocity is associated with java -- its the templating system to decouple code from presentation -- is this right?  \n08:40\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0in an apache environment  \n08:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep velocity and groovy are highly java oriented  \n08:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki is highly java oriented :)  \n08:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's not THE templating system, just one of the many ;)  \n08:41\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i guess velocity is the scripting language of choice for xwiki  \n08:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n08:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n08:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the easiest one  \n08:41\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0is there a good velocity tutorial out there  \n08:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's mostly for security reasons actually  \n08:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just 5-10 commands to know and you're st  \n08:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/st/set/  \n08:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0groovy would be great to use but it's way too powerfull so we limit it onlty to some super admin users  \n08:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0velocity is as powerful but we run it in a sandbox (which is harder to do for groovy)  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Dan18: re tutorial yes  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to get you the url but either xwiki.org is slow or it's my connection  \n08:44\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0thanks  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yuo can check out the dev guid  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guide  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a scripting section  \n08:45\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is xwiki.org responding for you guys?

 \n14:00\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0is there a classpath dir i can just dump the in ...  \n14:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, you need to drop those in classpath (the WEB-INF/lib under your server's webapps/xwiki ), but that won't be enough to be able to access them from velocity.  \n14:03\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok ...  \n14:03\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0what else would be needed  \n14:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in order to make them accessible from velocity you need to add some of them to the velocity context. You can learn here how you can do that:  \n14:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingComponents#HFromwikipages  \n14:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0for the API of a component  \n14:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0that document explains what are the steps to take to write a component  \n14:04\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0is velocity scripting not an option?  \n14:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0wdym?  \n14:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it is, the way I see it you need to write a wrapper which is an xwiki component to expose the APIs that you need from that lib to the velocity context  \n14:06\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i cant access a client \"jar\" lib directy from a velocity script?  \n14:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0no  \n14:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0you can from a groovy script though  \n14:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0because in velocity you cannot instantiate a class nor access statics  \n14:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in groovy you can  \n14:08\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0see here more info http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \n14:10\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0btw, are you familiar with php scripting  \n14:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0Dan18: no, I'm not...  \n14:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sorry  \n14:10\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok  \n14:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:11\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0how would you approach integrating gliffy in xwiki ...  \n14:11\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0would you go the component route  \n14:11\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0and then use velocity  \n14:11\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0?  \n14:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, your component would be just a facade in this case  \n14:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so that's not really complicated  \n14:13\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0right, but i guess it would need to deal with instantiations also  \n14:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0as for integration, I need to see what the usecases are...  \n14:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(I first need to see exactly what gliffy would be used for in xwiki to see what kind of API I would create. it could also be a macro)  \n14:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0whcih can be interesting  \n14:15\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i see, i think you are right  \n14:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:15\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i was working more bottom up since i still need to learn the technology itself  \n14:15\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0-- i.e. xwiki, macro, scripting, components, etc.  \n14:16\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0but eventually i would hit the top and start thinking usecases  \n14:18\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0a macro would probably wrap most of the functionality -- including a macro would include a Gliffy diagram, which can be \"opened\" in a new browser window to work on the diagram  \n14:18\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0when the diagram is closed, then an image of the diagram is pulled back to the xwiki page  \n14:19\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0but there is more, since gliffy supports versioning as well as handling several diagrams in folders  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki

speaking  \n14:41\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and that field has never meant velocity code, ever, in xwiki, afaik  \n14:41\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean semantically speaking  \n14:41\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0has quit  \n14:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I made it with the assumption that you controlled the pretty names of all the fields in your classes.  \n14:42\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the mechanism to answer the translation need is the one that I explained above, and if it's not working it needs to be fixed not reinvented a new one which can cause other problems  \n14:42\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0that's how I see this issue  \n14:42\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so I think that evaluate in there is wrong  \n14:43\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0as for control over pretty names, you don't always  \n14:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You can propose changing it, it is an api break but if it makes enough sense with pretty name translation working.  \n14:43\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0e.g. my case was the default configurable class and a .xar of an xwiki application  \n14:44\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0they exploded together and I didn't really have control over one or the other  \n14:44\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0only because a prop pretty name was, by mistake, invalid velocity syntax  \n14:44\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(and a stupid velocity bug that fails parsing when the source ends in a # or $)  \n14:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Well, I'm sorry you ran in to trouble, it's something that could be changed I suppose, perhaps we could add a field for version number so that applications in the wold with the old version are not broken (if there are any such things)  \n14:46\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*wild  \n14:50\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has quit  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n14:58\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has
