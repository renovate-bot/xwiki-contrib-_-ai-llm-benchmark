How can I set one of them as the default one? I mean, when someone opens up my url this will be the wiki presented  \n15:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you cannot chose which one is the default one  \n16:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the default is the \"main\" wiki, that we also call the \"home\"  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0barretto: each wiki can have it's own domain name so you can assign \"www.mydomain.com\" alias to whatever wiki you want  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you set it in the wiki descriptor (look at the wiki index)  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you also need to configure your DNS on your side  \n16:05\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0well, the main problem is that after a clean install of an xwiki (without flavor extension) the Wiki Application extension, which should enable this menu (http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Wiki+Application/add-wiki.png) doesn't works at the \"main\" wiki. I have absolutely no problem on using the main one, but I need to be able to provide this menu to my wiki users...  \n16:06\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0in fact I'd rather use the main one  \n16:07\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0when I create a new wiki, the menu appears and works just fine  \n16:08\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0so, if it works properly at the main wiki, I wont need to create a second wiki at all  \n16:21\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0Just to clearify i've installed these extensions: Extension Manager (manually), Administration Application/Wiki Application (via Extension Manager)  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:25\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:32\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n16:37\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0does xwiki:WikiManager.CreateWiki exist?  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: not sure what is the quesiton  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this page exists for sure  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/044ec6f97df64f9261a0db66185f644721747fc8/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-wiki/xwiki-platform-wiki-ui/xwiki-platform-wiki-ui-mainwiki/src/main/resources/WikiManager/CreateWiki.xml#L23-L23  \n16:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0my question was for barretto  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ah sorry I guess there was a question while I was disconnected :))  \n16:44\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0yes it exists  \n16:44\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0no problem, I'll rephrase my question @vmassol  \n16:46\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0after a clean install of an xwiki instance (without flavor extension) I've installed the following extensions: Extension Manager (manually), Administration Application/Wiki Application (via Extension Manager). the Wiki Application extension, which should enable this menu (http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Wiki+Application/add-wiki.png) doesn't works at the \"main\" wiki.  \n16:46\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0When I create a new wiki, it works just fine and menu is properly provided  \n16:47\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0so, I have no problem using the main wiki as long as it properly provides the wiki application menu. I was thinking about using a new wiki and setting it as default, but as gdelhumeau stated it is not possible to override the \"main\" wiki  \n16:52\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0this is how the top right menu appears at the \"main\" wiki  \n16:52\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0http://imgur.com/a/ITX3A  \n16:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so the problem is that it's written \"create wiki\" instead of \"+ wiki\"?  \n17:07\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0no, the problem is that the other options are missing... like  \n17:08\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0http://imgur.com/a/2vDBd  \n17:13\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0looks like the navigation should look like when you are in a sub wiki; there one has the \"Delete Wiki\" option, but no \"Add wiki\" one  \n17:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0barretto: I see  \n17:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you need the user application too  \n17:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\"User Directory Application\"  \n17:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and the Index Application  \n17:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0basically you need to install all extensions that are normally bundled with the default flavor  \n17:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you might as well install the flavor  \n18:06\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0gdelhumeau: ok, I'll install those extensions. do you think that install flavor and delete all pages is better than starting with a clean one and install extensions?  \n18:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you don't need to delete all pages  \n18:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0to install the flavor  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0i mean, after installing the flavor  \n18:11\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0like blog, sandbox, etc..  \n18:11\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0that's why I'm trying a clean install  \n18:12\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0I want all functionality but no content  \n18:15\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0gdelhumeau: and for the User Directory Application (http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/User+Directory+Application) I can't find it in the Ext. Manager nor any .xar download. I presume it is installed by default, right?  \n18:16\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0sorry, I've found it under \"local extensions\" in the EM  \n18:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0then it was already installed I suppose  \n18:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0according to your needs, it seems better to do as you started  \n18:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0starting from nothing, and install only apps that you need  \n18:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but notice that subwikis are created with the default flavor for subwikis  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:23\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0yes, now it makes sense why sub-wikis had a fully working top right menu while main wiki didnt  \n18:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0barretto: yep  \n18:44\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0gdelhumeau: thanks! i'll get back soon with other questions \u00a0(mainly about URL rewrite and how-to disable RPC API)  \n18:52\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0BTW, any documentation on how to setup JNDI in hibernate.cfg?  \n19:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:56\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0has quit  \n19:58\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:26\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n23:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
