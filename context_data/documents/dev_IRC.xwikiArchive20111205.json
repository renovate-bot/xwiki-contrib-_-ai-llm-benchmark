 \n11:28\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems it's the same actuzlly  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rev2=10.1  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have 2 notifications though  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I see this in the id for the faq application: \"${defaultIdPrefix}faq-application\"  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you know who's set this? is it automatic?  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the value of \"$defaultIdPrefix\"?  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we have a rule for the ids we should use on extensions.xwiki.org?  \n11:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's a configuration but having ${defaultIdPrefix} is a bugn is it a new page ?  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not a new page  \n11:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so probably been created when there was a bug in the sheet  \n11:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can find the condiguration in the admin UI  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: so right now the id is set empty when creating a new extension, right?  \n11:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what's the default id?  \n11:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's weird, I did set one, maybe it has been reseted  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so the default id is: prefix + page name with spaces replaced by dash (\"-\") ?  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(all in lowercase)  \n11:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0prefix + cleaned name yes (don't remember exactly the applied filter)  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what are the consequences of changing an id? does it mean that locally installed extensions won't be recoegnized as installed if the id has changed on the server and you install the \"new\" extension?  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie they'll be considered as 2 different extensions)  \n11:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's the same as changing the id of a maven artifact  \n11:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's what EM use to know it's the same extensions with just a different version  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so we should be careful not to change it  \n11:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so if it's not the same extension then no upgrade etc...  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even if the page name ahs changed  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so changing the prefix in the preferences is really really dangerous  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes it's not supposed to be changed it just use the page name the first time becuase it has to use something  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I wonder if we should even allow it to be changed  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but the best is to explicitely provide it  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we need it in the admin at all?  \n11:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: how to you set it without admin ?  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you need to set it?  \n11:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0because it's XR  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n11:41\u00a0<CIA-115>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* rf90e02c\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/XWiki.java :\u000f XWIKI-7224: XWikiPreferences in view mode does no not redirect to admin mode - http://git.io/GaBOvw  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not just extensions.xwiki.org  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sevral difference repository will not have the same prefix  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where is this prefix used?  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0to not have collisions  \n11:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0EM get extensions comming form several repositories and they need to have different ids if it's no the same extensions, the repository prefix is a protection for people who never set explicitely the id  \n11:42\u00a0<CIA-115>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f stable-3.2.x\u000f \\* r4900027\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/XWiki.java :\u000f XWIKI-7224: XWikiPreferences in view mode does no not redirect to admin mode ...  \n11:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but as I said the best is to properly choose your id  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0its so important that we shouldn't let people choose it IMO  \n11:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0also you can change the prefix id if you want  \n11:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not going to break anything  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why not hardcode it to extensions.xwiki.org: when creating a new extension  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n11:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's used to generate an id when you create en extension  \n11:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: because again it's XR  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so ${defaultIdPrefix} is no longer used?  \n11:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not going to help much having it on git...  \n11:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it is  \n11:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0again it's used when you create en extension  \n11:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's the variable comming from the configuration  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after you created the extension  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what value does the id field has?  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0org.xwiki.extensions:...  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0${defaultIdPrefix}....  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n11:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0again it's not a dynamic id its generated when the extensions is age is created, as I said you just found an extension which has been created when there was a bug in the sheet that made it priint ${defaultIdPrefix} instead of its value  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok if the value is used now then good  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't see it but that's probably because it wasn't set on extensions.xwiki.org  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it might still be good to have some validation on this  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when validating an extension  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some custom validation for extensions.xwiki.org for ex  \n11:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is a integration test on this  \n11:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's actually the first thing that has been tested  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it's not working  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since on extensions.xwiki.org  \n11:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what do you want to validate ?  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have valid extensions that don't have the prefix  \n11:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0they are valid  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0verify that on extensions.xwiki.org there's not extension  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that doesn't have the \"org.xwiki.extensions:\" prefix  \n11:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the prefix is just for people not setting explicit id  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I don't think we want to allow people to choose their id completely  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's going to be a mess  \n11:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's just here to be a default id prefix and nothing elese  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least the prefix should be set  \n11:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you import an extension comming from a maven repository it's going to keep the same id  \n11:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise yo ubreak it  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n11:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n11:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it should not\\*  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if someone sets a full extension id of \"panel\" we need to know  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it's not a good id  \n11:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure it's not good id  \n11:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but that's another subject  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the subject I 'm discussing :)  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie how to have good ids and define a naming rule  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we're going to start using the EM real soon now  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and chagning ids is very important  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/very important/a major change/  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically ids are like APIs  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as important as APIs  \n11:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0naming rule is one thing, having a technically validation for them is not that easy, it's not just about some regexp  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the panel macro is currnetl set as:  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"panel-macro\"  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in a few days/weeks the panel macro will be released in the xwiki maven repo  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with a groupid of \"org.xwiki.contrib\"  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what will we do?  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is there a notion of \"id alias\"? :)  \n11:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0put the proper id  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or \"deprecated ids\")  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it means people who have it already installed will see it as available for installation  \n11:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not like the current id has been really chosen  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not hte issue  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue is for users  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they don't care about the id  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they don't even know about it  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they see it's available and they install the \"panel macro\"  \n11:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes and if you don't touch the id there is not going to be any issue with that  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we probably need some \"alias\" feature to allow id renaming  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you said the opposite  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"put the proper id\"  \n11:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0put the proper id from the start  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahah  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's funny  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's like saying: write code without bugs  \n11:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it should have never been an id like that  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the proof  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that the panel macro can already be installed  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with the id \"panel-macro\"  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex the Plover app provided by jerome  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has a strange name and I think jerome might have made a mistake and he might want to rename it in the future  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we keep the same id  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or should we allow to rename it  \n12:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure we have a beta in progress repository from which you can install stuff not fully validated as ready to be installed  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw we haven't compeltely decided yet on page names for extensions either  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0more speicficallt do we suffix with \"Applicatoin\", \"Macro\", etc  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(do we force it)  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or not  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since that's going to be used as the default id, it means that as soon as the page is saved the extension is available for use from XE installs  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we need a manual validation step  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same as what apple does with the app store ;)  \n12:11\u00a0<CIA-115>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r71e400b\u000f \u000f/ (2 files in 2 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7228: Support URL without explicit prefix in XR download link - http://git.io/SfGekQ  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: fyi just got a bug trying to install the FAQ app: http://pastebin.com/dCW7NPqu  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Caused by: class java.io.IOException: Invalid answer (201) fo the server when requesting  \n12:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I think I just got the same in the test i'm currently writing actually, the download link is an URL ?

 \n12:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm, Denis indeed you are probably right  \n12:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since we actually never had the use case in real...  \n12:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so comparing class name is probably totally useless anyway  \n12:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well that's cool, will make the CM even quicker ;)  \n12:25\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0probably, you should put that in your recent improvement  \n12:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually findbugs will even report a style violation: http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/bugDescriptions.html#EQ\\_COMPARING\\_CLASS\\_NAMES  \n12:31\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: do you know why http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-extension/ have been failing for so long?

 \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: btw it seems the LT filtering for \"plugin\" is broken: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome#|t=extensions&p=1&l=30&s=doc.creationDate&d=desc&type=plugin  \n13:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: changed its type when I made it working without the need to setup xwiki.cfg plugins variable to basically not getting plugin related installation instructions anymore  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it should be a components no?
