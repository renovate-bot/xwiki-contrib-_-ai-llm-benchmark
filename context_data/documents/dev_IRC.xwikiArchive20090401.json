(it's over this point i hesitate in my already submitted proposal)  \nxwikibot - (01/04/2009 23:54): Main.Roadmap was modified by xwiki:XWiki.fciubotaru - http://xoffice.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Roadmap  \nlucaa - (01/04/2009 23:56): tudor\\_f: the plan and milestones you made? yes, they are discussable. But what is the aspect you're not sure of?  \ntudor\\_f - (01/04/2009 23:57): if it's ok to structure my plan around 11 weeks, knowing that the pre-estimate is 8 weeks  \ntudor\\_f - (01/04/2009 23:57): but as i have mentioned, knowing this is just an approximation - and expecting the periods to shorten  \ntudor\\_f - (01/04/2009 23:58): (by pre-estimate understanding the '2 month' bit on the projects' page)  \nlucaa - (01/04/2009 23:59): tudor\\_f: if you think that you will need more, yes, it's ok.  \n\n"}
