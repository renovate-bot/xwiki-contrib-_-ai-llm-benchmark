But none for Deki. Is there an easy way for it, or would it be a manual import?  \n00:29\u00a0<qwebirc12253>\u00a0is now known as <NewAtXWiki>  \n00:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Some work has been done on mediawiki imports.  \n00:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Import+MediaWiki+To+XWiki <-- there is this  \n00:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I can't speak directly to how well it works as I have not used it.  \n00:31\u00a0<NewAtXWiki>\u00a0Yes, that's what we're planning on using for MediaWiki.  \n00:32\u00a0<NewAtXWiki>\u00a0But most of our wiki entries are in Deki.

I don't think sergiu's commit fixed the problem. I see there are 3 failing tests on platform  \n08:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that wasn't about the tests  \n08:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was about the build itself for the release  \n08:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm talking about his commit that changed project.version to rendering.version  \n08:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but I think its last commit is causing the platform test failures  \n08:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0s/its/his  \n08:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll test it locally  \n08:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0anyway, I think the problem is that maven doesn't allow you to build and use an extension in the same reactor.

So, yesterday evening we had only one issue: the linkchecker extension problem. When I saw sergiu's commit I deduce that it's related to this problem, i.e. it's a fix. But i see that it made a new problem: the failing tests  \n08:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ah, ok  \n08:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0this is good  \n08:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n08:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what else has he done?  \n08:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but this wasn't the release problem (well, it was minor, I had to manually resolve that dependency)  \n08:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see any other comit from sergiu  \n08:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0in this case, nothing, this is his only commit I think  \n08:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however I can think of an issue  \n08:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0then I don't understand why there are platform tests failing  \n08:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a02 in linkchecker module  \n08:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0package plugin IT tests require link checker which require package mojo  \n08:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll fix this one  \n08:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it'll fix the release issue  \n08:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea about the linkchecker test error ATM  \n08:51\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Vincent Massol\u000f master\u000f \\* r427e1ab\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-rendering/xwiki-platform-rendering-macros/xwiki-platform-rendering-macro-script/src/main/java/org/xwiki/rendering/macro/script/ScriptMacroParameters.java :\u000f [Misc] Try to improve description for the \"wiki\" parameter - http://git.io/ZVa2VA  \n09:06\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n09:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n09:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still need 15 mn  \n09:28\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0committing  \n09:49\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Vincent Massol\u000f master\u000f \\* r3bda347\u000f \u000f/ (10 files in 10 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7317: Add \"package\" Mojo to Packager plugin in order to create custom HSQDB/Jetty distributions ...  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: committted  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hopefully this fixes the release issue  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now going to look at the linkchecker tests  \n09:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'll try  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm works locally  \n09:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the latest platform build on CI, which is about to finish, still has those 2 failing tests  \n10:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:11\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:27\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: can we commit stuff on platform for 3.4RC1 already ?
