Essentially, the user would fill out a form with name, description of item, price, item picture and then the page would be created from that. I've looked up tutorials but I haven't found one that incorporates image uploading.  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lamium: regarding forms you should follow the FAQ tutorial on xwiki.org  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it explains how to create some structure/forms  \n12:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can also use appwithinminutes  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: the FAQ tutorial explains that  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are 2 tutorials  \n12:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n12:00\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0I tried app within minutes but there was no option for image uploading  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/FAQTutorial  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding image uploading I'm not an expert, a simple version can be to ask users to attach an image to the page but you can also create some HTML button to upload the image, would need to research it to let you know how to do it though  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here's maybe something that could help:  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/HTML5Upload  \n12:02\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0okay, that is the part I was hoping that xwiki would have an option for. I mean once I've got the image uploaded I was assuming I could maybe store the link as a variable and then pass all the variables out and build a page with the variables on the fly  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I also found this: http://xwiki.475771.n2.nabble.com/HTML5-File-Upload-td7583955.html  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0App within minute may have an image picker , let me check  \n12:03\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0I didn't notice one if there was  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if marius was here he'd know...  \n12:04\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0but thanks for the links! I can see about throwing something together with this  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/App+Within+Minutes+Application  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0It mentions an example to add a new picker  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\"External Image\"  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't see a nice picker  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah there's this too:  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Attachment+Selector+Macro  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Lamium)  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's probably the simplest  \n12:05\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0Yeah was just reading through it now  \n12:06\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0I didn't see that external image picker when I was running through it but maybe I haven't configured something right  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw you can watch this issue for the image picker: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8589  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for AWM)  \n12:07\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0Also I must say, kudos to all the folk who built this. I'm using it in a personal project for knowledge reference and it's simply amazing!  \n12:07\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0Ah yes, I'm also experienced in JIRA, I work on EU Projects as my full-time job :)  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks Lamium, would be great fi you could tweet something about it and then we/you could that reference to our testimonial page at http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/References/Testimonials  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that helps us a lot to have these testimonials :)  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gives us a boost!  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice re EU projects  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think there are several using XWiki  \n12:09\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0Yeah, I'm working on one called webinos at the moment  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks for the tweet, just saw it ;)  \n12:12\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0Yeah was about to say that I just tweeted :)  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll update the testimonial page, thanks  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done, thanks again  \n12:14\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0My only critique about the thing at the moment is there is very little documentation on very specific things. For instance when I was looking up a way to create pages using xwiki none of them had an image uploader option (which is very common throughout CMS engines). But the one thing I do see is that the repositories and JIRA are very active and that is really good news for support and so on  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we have good support, we're lacking a bit on the developer documentation  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the user one should be pretty good but the dev one can be improved  \n12:15\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0Also your JIRA base is very structured compared to some EU projects I have seen ;)  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe :)  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think the reason you didn't see any specific picker is that we come from the wiki domain and images are added as attachments nomrally  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*normally  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're getting there though  \n12:17\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0I agree, there are many things in the XWiki that I would class as being CMS stuff and I must say you are doing a good job of blending the 2 so far :)  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup the differences between CMS and wikis are slowly disappearing but we want to keep the idea of creating content collaboratively in the wiki which is not the strong point of traditional CMSes  \n12:19\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0Yeah I did notice when creating content collaboratively with my team that notices kept on popping up saying that 'X' user currently has lock on this document for editing or something along those lines  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah regarding locking we have improvements planned  \n12:20\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0excellent!  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've released a first experimental real time editor  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/RealTime+Wiki+Editor  \n12:20\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0do you have a github bramch for it?  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(wiki editor only ATM)  \n12:21\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0ah I see, that was going to be my first question, is there WYSIWYG :P  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we want to work on this too: http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Improvements/CollaborativeEditing  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have some wysiwyg one but it's really a hard topic and it's not ready for prime time yet  \n12:22\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0I can understand that  \n12:22\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0If you can manage to implement the google doc system on xwiki that would be amazing  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n12:23\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0but I understand that stuff like that is very difficult  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lamium: here's our try for that: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/wiki30/tree/master/wiki30-realtime-wysiwyg-plugin  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in case you're interested to look at the sources)  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that project (wiki 3.0) produced 2 real time editors: one wysiwyg and one wiki, we released the wiki one on http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/RealTime+Wiki+Editor  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the wysiwyg one didn't get released yet, we have some blocking issues to make it as a good, feature-wise as the current wysiwyg editor  \n12:27\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0I'm assuming it's all coded in Java yes?  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some video of that project (wiki editor though): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGdrVhATI3E  \n12:30\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0Taking a look at the video now, looks good so far  \n12:36\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0I like it!

Handle all the 3 Events in the same onEvent method or write 3 separate Listeners for each of the Event ?  \n16:57\u00a0<kstuart1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan\\_\\_: \u00a0it mostly depends on how similar the reaction on these events are going to be  \n17:00\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(there is no official best practice)  \n17:01\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, my biggest problem is that I don't know how to see inside onEvent method which Event actually triggered this.  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if these events are going to manipulate different concept then I guess the cleanest is to have difference listener, but if they do pretty much the same thing like update a cache then it should be in the same listener  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you get the event as parameter  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can use instanceof  \n17:02\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0the first param of the onEvent method is an object of type Event, but I don't know what to call on it to get my  \n17:02\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0\\*get what I need  \n17:02\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0I don't have instanceOf :(  \n17:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instanceof  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's part of java  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan\\_\\_: \u00a0where are you exactly ?  \n17:03\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0I know, but Eclipse autocomplete does not have this option  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are not in java ?  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I can assure you Eclipse knows instanceof  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0public void onEvent(Event event, Object source, Object data)  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0event.  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not a method  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a keyword  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0ah ok  \n17:05\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0so something like:  \n17:05\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0public void onEvent(Event event, Object source, Object data)  \n17:05\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//my Code  \n17:05\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}  \n17:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n17:06\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0ok, thanks :)  \n17:08\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0playing with this I found out that when XWIki starts (each start) several documents are modified, or at least they trigger the DocumentUpdatedEvent.  \n17:08\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0documents like Watchlist, etc  \n17:08\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0I didn't know this :)  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I think there is jira issues about this  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0having a document modified that often is wrong  \n17:14\u00a0<sburjan\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<Lamium1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:16\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:23\u00a0<Lamium>\u00a0has quit  \n17:23\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool marius :)  \n18:58\u00a0<Inge>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<tdelafosse\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0@jvelo1 ping  \n19:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:45\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:46\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:22\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n22:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:46\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:50\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit\n"}
