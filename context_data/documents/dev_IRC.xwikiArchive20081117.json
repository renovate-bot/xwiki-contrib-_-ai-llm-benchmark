If you've imported the default XAR then you have the blog feature in your application. See also http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/BlogApplication  \nHoffmann - (17/11/2008 10:43): i use a .war ....  \nHoffmann - (17/11/2008 10:43): there is no blog application available at the moment  \nasyd - (17/11/2008 10:44): because you need to import the default xar  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 10:48): Hoffmann: if you only have the war then you wiki is empty.

I didn't want to mention this since it wasn't easy to do but here you go since you asked ;)  \nasyd - (17/11/2008 11:04): ok :)  \nasyd - (17/11/2008 11:06): ppff, dunno if it's wordpress, but it's very difficult to paste some xml into a post  \nHoffmann - (17/11/2008 12:15): hey guys....sorry....i had to eat something...thanks for helping with xar....nice week  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 12:21): lunch time, bbiab  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 13:28): XWiki.glennms was modified by XWiki.glennms (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/glennms  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 14:32): Plugins.DocumentTreePlugin was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Rollback to version 10.1) - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Plugins/DocumentTreePlugin  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 15:57): Main.How To Update with DB Refresh was modified by xwiki:XWiki.polx (cleanup and more serious) - http://curriki.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/How+To+Update+with+DB+Refresh  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 16:06): XWiki.KhairlAnwar was modified by XWiki.KhairlAnwar (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/KhairlAnwar  \nHoffmann - (17/11/2008 16:32): cant`t handle web plan with namespace -- expekting http//....../web2.0 does anyone know why xwiki 1.5 is the only one which works with geronimo and webshphere without any changes??  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:28): hi guys  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:28): lucaa, mflorea, thomasmortagne, jvdrean and everyone interested: I'd like to discuss the UI to display errors in the rendering  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:29): vmassol: I'm here  \nasyd - (17/11/2008 17:29): oh, while I'm thinking, is there a RFE to add a default value for flat properties? (like string, date, etc.). If no, maybe I fill one? ;p  \nlucaa - (17/11/2008 17:29): vmassol: me too  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:30): ok so the idea is to display information when some part of the rendering fails. For example when a macro doesn't exist or fails to execute  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:30): We've discussed this in the past on the list and I think we agree that we want contextual information rather than fail the whole rendering, right?  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:30): yes  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:31): so one idea is to have a <span class=\"xwiki-error\"> element  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:31): with the content being the error message  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:31): such as: <span class=\"xwiki-error\">Unknown macro: something</span>  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:32): so the doc would be rendered normally except that instead of the macro result you'd see a box  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:32): with a certain style and containing the error message  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:32): we also need to display the full description of the error  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:32): (for ex the stack trace)  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:33): one idea would be to do that as tooltip but I'm not sure it's the best idea  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:33): we could also do something with JS  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:34): but we need to store the description somewhere anyway  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:34): yes, something like \"more\" and when you click you can see the entire stack trace is better, I think  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:35): (could be in alt attribute or in some <!--errordescriptionstart--> comment (provided this is available through the DOM))  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:35): yes, the text of the comment can be accessed using DOM api  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:36): from javascript  \nHoffmann - (17/11/2008 17:36): cant`t handle web plan with namespace -- expekting http//....../web2.0 does anyone know why xwiki 1.5 is the only one which works with geronimo and webshphere without any changes??  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:36): ok so the question is what is the best location for storing the description?  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:36): Hoffmann: no idea  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:36): it seems so. attribute or comment  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:38): I'm fore comment, for the sake of consistency  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:38): sure although it's a little bit different, till now comments are used for non visible metadata information  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:39): here it's for visible non-metadata information  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:39): but yes comments sounds good to me  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:39): we'll need to find it from DOM though  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:40): so this means some lightweight parsing  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:40): what about the ALT attribute?  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:40): is it good or bad that it is displayed when hovering over the error?  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:40): I see your point, but the exception message/stack trace are not really part of the data/content. I agree it's not meta data either.  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:41): could also be displayed in a box when double clicking the error message (in addition to the hover)  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:41): afaik, alt attr is not used for tooltip, but title attr  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:42): alt is used when the browser cannot render that element  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:42): I think it depends on the browser but ok  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:42): yes you're right  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:43): I think a special hovering or double clicking is important since users will want to copy paste the content  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:43): so the default browser hover is not enough for sure  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:44): another solution is to display only the error message in place and have a list of all errors displayed at the top of the document with available details when clicking on some \"more\" button  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:44): or both  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:45): so it might not be semantically right to set the alt attribute with the exception stack trace. So I guess we're lest with the comment solution. Using DOM api si really easy to get a reference to the comment. If the comment precedes the span then a simply span.previousSibling.data will retrieve the content of the comment  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:45): right, good idea with the sibling api  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:46): so displaying a summary of all errors in the page could also be done with a JS script  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:46): (I wouldn't put that in the rendering anyway)  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:46): now, regarding the UI, I agree that hovering is not enough  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:46): yes, one could iterated all the comment that preced error-spans  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:47): but I think is better to have all the info at the place where the exception occured.  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:48): on the other hand, if the document is big, then you might want to have all the error in one place  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:49): yes that was my point  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:49): I think both is probably best  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:49): (just an idea) we could have a bottom-tab for listing errors  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:49): I prefer top  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:49): it has to be visible  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:50): the user must notice  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:50): right  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:50): so here's the proposal:  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:50): <p>Unknown <span class=\"xwikierror\">Unknown macro: unknown<!--errordescription:The 'unknown' macro is not in the list of registered macros. Try checking the spelling or contact your administrator.--><!--startmacro:unknown|-||-|--><!--stopmacro--></span> macro</p>  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:50): ok  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:50): hmmm do I need a <p> inside the span?  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:51): why?  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:51): don't know  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:51): just asking  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:51): it's strange mixing text  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:51): with non text elements  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:51): (it's easier for me without p though)  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:51): span is inline so it should not contain p  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:52): right  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:52): ok this is good for you right?  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:52): lucaa: ok for you too?  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:52): yes  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:52): jvdrean: ok?  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:53): thomasmortagne: ok?  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:53): I need just one more ok and I can implement it...  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:53): come on  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:53): :)  \nthomasmortagne - (17/11/2008 17:54): yes it's ok for me  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:54): cool, starting the implementation  \nvmassol - (17/11/2008 17:54): thanks marius for the talk  \nmflorea - (17/11/2008 17:55): you're welcome vincent  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 20:12): Design.NewWysiwygEditorInterface was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvdrean - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/NewWysiwygEditorInterface  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 20:13): Design.NewWysiwygEditorInterface was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvdrean - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/NewWysiwygEditorInterface  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 20:23): XWiki.NikolayTischenko was modified by XWiki.NikolayTischenko (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/NikolayTischenko  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 20:27): view.Replication was modified by XWiki.NikolayTischenko - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/view/Replication  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 20:48): view.Replication was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol (deleted document) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/view/Replication  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 20:49): XWiki.XWikiAllGroup was modified by xwiki:XWiki.RaffaelloPelagalli - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiAllGroup  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 20:49): XWiki.NikolayTischenko was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol (deleted document) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/NikolayTischenko  \nxwikibot - (17/11/2008 21:58): Design.NewWysiwygEditorInterface was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvdrean - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/NewWysiwygEditorInterface  \n\n"}
