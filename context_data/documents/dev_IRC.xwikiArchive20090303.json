Not really, I just understand that $doc is the AdminSheet document context instead of the XWiki.Import one  \njvelociter - (03/03/2009 09:49): I think it's a hard one to cleanly fix :) several devs lost teeths trying :D  \njvelociter - (03/03/2009 09:50): I reverted Vincent's commit (the first one you proposed on JIRA) and applied the later one instead  \nDenis - (03/03/2009 10:11): jvelociter: yes, but at the same time, the patch proposed by vmassol was a better coding practice, and we do not know where was the real issue behind that and this will lead for sure to a return of the bug later, even in another application than the admin one.  \njvelociter - (03/03/2009 10:12): Denis: yes I agree, this is something that ultimetaly we'll have to solve  \njvelociter - (03/03/2009 10:12): but Vincent commit broke a feature   \njvelociter - (03/03/2009 10:13): we have to commit it when we are sure we do not break something else  \nDenis - (03/03/2009 10:13): jvelociter: may be you have to left an open issue in JIRA to followup on this  \njvelociter - (03/03/2009 10:13): I think we have one already  \njvelociter - (03/03/2009 10:13): let me check  \nDenis - (03/03/2009 10:14): jvelociter: which one ?
