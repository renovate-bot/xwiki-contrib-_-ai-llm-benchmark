I can't see the logs on nexus, but the artifact is still broken  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we should restart nexus  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the last error I get in the logs is  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02012-08-17 14:11:14 ERROR [-11860715-21066] - o.s.n.r.NexusApplic~ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Unhandled exception or error intercepted  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space  \n16:01\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has quit  \n16:01\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:01\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:17\u00a0<ries>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<coud>\u00a0Hi, I have problem using annotations. I followed FAQ tutorial and created application based on it. In resulting application I can add annotations to all class properties but annotations added to textarea are not highlighted. Here is screenshot: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/607/annotationproblem.png/  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0coud: have you enabled annotations?  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just checked the image)  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the screenshot looks ok, what's wrong?  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I know, the textarea is wrapped by an {{html}}\u00a0macro so the annotation is added for the whole block  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think this is a known limitation  \n17:04\u00a0<coud>\u00a0vmassol there should be \"some text\" highlighted in the \"Use case text\" section of the page  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me test  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I can even make that worse\u2026. :)  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tested in the blog application, trying to annotate the content of a blog post  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is a textarea similar to your use case)  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and for me the whole textarea is not even displayed when there's an annotation ;)  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I get exactly this: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-6328  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we currently have a limitation when annotating HTML content but I don't remember the details  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(anca is the one who coded this but she's not connected)  \n17:08\u00a0<coud>\u00a0vmassol thats bad.. :) I noticed this behavior (all text dissapeared) when I created application with \"app withing minute\" application.  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I agree it's bad  \n17:10\u00a0<coud>\u00a0ok, is there any workaround ? For example should I use some another data type or something ?  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes there's a workaround  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me try it first  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0coud: ok it works  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of writing:  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$doc.display(\"description\")  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for ex)  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can write:  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#set ($obj = $doc.getObject(\"Test.TestClass\"))  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$obj.getProperty(\"description\").getValue()  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$doc.display() is the code that will add the {{html}} macro around the content  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if you don't use that and instead directly put the textarea content you won't have any html macro and your annotation will work fine  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:24\u00a0<coud>\u00a0vmassol yes, it works! thank you! :)  \n17:45\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:44\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n18:55\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:05\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:06\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:09\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n19:14\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:28\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:35\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:45\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:31\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:48\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:49\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:50\u00a0<coud>\u00a0has quit  \n22:52\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:33\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
