I am a bit confused, because in the docs it says for the second entry \"Maps XWiki groups to LDAP groups\". Shouldnt it be the other way round?  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea, I've never used this feature  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe someone else on this channel can help if the doc is unclear  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if you wish to map groups it seems \"xwiki.authentication.ldap.group\\_mapping\" would be the one  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other one seems to be for mapping other fields  \n13:58\u00a0<benedict>\u00a0i will try it, thanks :)  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the master is ldap  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki is just syncing with it  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we map xwiki groups to existing ldap groups  \n14:43\u00a0<irctc601>\u00a0has quit  \n14:44\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:59\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:59\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n14:59\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:10\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n15:13\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:31\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi I'm working on creating a test fwk for writing unit tests for wiki pages  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and I'm getting close to a first version)  \n16:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Hi devs, I'm confident to find Maven guru here (but please don't judge my weird set up, I tried to avoid but I'm not alone on this project)  \n16:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I built a maven module (mvn clean install)  \n16:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Everything's ok  \n16:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Then, on another folder  \n16:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I tried also to build  \n17:00\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0The second folder depend on the JAR from the first  \n17:00\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And then, I reach a 'Failure to find artifact'  \n17:00\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0However, I checked in my ~/.m2 and the jar exists...  \n17:01\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0It seems that Maven 3 don't want to look in the local repository (for reproducability of builds)  \n17:02\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Does it look like this is this \"feature\" of Maven 3 problem? If yes, can I solve that?  \n17:03\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(just to make it clear, the 2 folders are not in the same maven project, it's NOT a subfolder in the same project)  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0woshilapin: this sounds weird actually to me but I'm not an expert, just using it a lot  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what happen with -o ?  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0woshilapin: maybe you have an error in the dep  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you think it goes to the first artifact but it's different  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(like not specifying the type and it lookts for a jar when it's actually a xar)  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it still does not look in the local repository with -o then it's definitely a bug since the point of -o is to force Maven to look only in the local repository  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep could be a <type> issue  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what error do you get exactly ?  \n17:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0<type> is a jar, I checked  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep we need gist/pastebin or both builds  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/or/of  \n17:09\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Ah  \n17:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I should do a mvn clean install to install in local, right?  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0clean no but install yes  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what do yo do?  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just test? or package?  \n17:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0mvn package would not work ?  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it wouldn't  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0package just builds reh jar  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't install it in the local repo  \n17:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, this is maybe my problem then (and my eyes are not that good because, there was file in .m2 but not the JAR)  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's install)  \n17:11\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(only jar.lastUpdated and other files)  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0woshilapin: jar.lastUpdated actually been created by maven more or less to indicate it did not found it  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and not retry again)  \n17:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, now the JAR is in .m2 and I have another (weird) error  \n17:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0[WARNING] Rule 0: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.BannedDependencies failed with message:  \n17:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0XWiki uses SLF4J for logging.
