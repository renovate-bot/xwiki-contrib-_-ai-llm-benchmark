Enjoying GSoC and XWiki?  \n07:12\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0Learning a lot. Little hectic but enjoying..  \n07:12\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0took a while to get comfortable with things.  \n07:13\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0By the sergiu, The API list is growing too big. It is so cluttered in the design page.  \n07:13\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0So thought of generating javadocs as I got access to my gihub contrib today  \n07:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep, nothing's better than code itself  \n07:19\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0sdumitriu: I went through XWiki architecture the other day. \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Architecture . Do you any links for the detailed documentation of this? By the way XWiki has moved completely to component based?  \n07:20\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0Do you have you any links for the detailed documentation of this \\*  \n07:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, the Architecture page is getting deprecated...  \n07:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Not everything is a component yet, but we're moving towards that goal  \n07:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The rule is that no new code should be non-component  \n07:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Detailed documentation, unfortunately no  \n07:32\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0sdumitriu: If it doesn't take much of your time, I'm inquisitive to know why XWiki's architecture is moved from plug in based architecture to component based  \n07:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:38\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n07:40\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:50\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0sdumitriu: If I'm not taking much of your time, could you please tell me why XWiki moved from plugin based to component based architecture?  \n07:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep  \n07:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Basically, XWiki \"plugins\" had very limited power  \n07:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0A component is a new interface that can do any thing it wants  \n07:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0A plugin had to implement an interface that contained just a few methods  \n07:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And most of them were tied to the old rendering engine (Radeox) and old syntax (xwiki/1.0)  \n07:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So it was a big core with a few spikes plugged into it  \n07:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Now components form a free-form graph, connecting between each other as they need  \n07:58\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0sdumitriu: I understand to some extent. When I start exploring more, I think i'll get a better hang of XWiki's architecture.

Does anyone have some time to review my pull request about exclude failing tests on IE9 ? https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/pull/23  \n14:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0there is something odd at the lastest snapshot on trunk, it seems XE is not included, it's like an empty platform only  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to review the build since I've noticed lots of jenkins errors sent by mail  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: hi, what's the status re the 4.1M2 release?  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when do we start the release?  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are we all ready?  \n14:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0odd, I never saw such a build .. with platform only  \n14:53\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I'm ready when the developers are  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so never  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:53\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0well...  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you want me to play the role of RM?  \n14:54\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Maybe I'm not understanding it properly?  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie ask the question)  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's about gathering everyone around the planned release date  \n14:54\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Should I go around and bust people to get their stuff in order?  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could do this:  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- start by asking here to people online whether they are ready and if not when, mentioning the planned release date  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- then send a mail on the list saying that you're going to cut the release at that date  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0people who have important stuff to do on 4.1:  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Roadmap  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0namely: marius/thomas for EM, jeanvincent for Hiding tehc content, Sergiu for app generation module  \n14:57\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Well I can send mail to the list saying I'll release tomorrow if nobody objects, or perhaps I should say friday so people have longer to object?  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can do that too  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can say tomorrow since we're already late  \n14:57\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I don't like nagging people directly  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's about asking  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not really directly  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're all here  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example:  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea/tmortagne: are you done for 4.1M2 on EM? Is it ok to release tomorrow?  \n14:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, I'm working for RC1 now  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(taking into account that the planned release date was 28th of May so we're already late)  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ok thanks  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne is having lunch; he'll be back soon  \n14:59\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0there seem to be a few problems with this design (or maybe it's problems with me since I'm the only one who has trouble).. \u00a0I see #1 the RM can't release until everyone is ok, #2 lots of commits come in at the last minute making it wowefully unstable when the release comes..  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: yep  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#1 is not fully correct  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order for the RM to respect the release date  \n15:01\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0so the date is basicly just a number..  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he needs to ask devs beforehand  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here's the situation  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have a roadmap  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and a date  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our goal is to do the max defined in the roadmap for the date  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if someone requires one more day to have his important stuff in the release  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I would find it a pity to not include his stuff for 1 day  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now if that same dev says he needs 1 week more  \n15:02\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0IMO that's not true because committing just before release damages stability.  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then that's too much and he shoudl wait for the next release  \n15:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjd/vmassol: I don't work on anything blocker for M2  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok thanks  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ping  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: ping  \n15:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(working on generic 3-ways merge before merging the diff module)  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: that's why we have milestones and RCs  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and automated tests)  \n15:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and me :)  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: but if you want me to say that's it's bad practice to commit on the last day then yes it definitely is  \n15:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it's also to test when others still commit. glad we';; lahve stagning for RC's  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and sburjan too  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I test today, and tomorrow just before you start the release someone commits something that is a blocker, and I won't be able to get it on time :)  \n15:05\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0If we do things which are bad practice, that's ok IMO, everyone has flaws. If we document the way things really work then we can work on improving the process.. As long as we are honest and don't smooth over the rough edges in documenting it.  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: I'm all for testing a different strategy but please propose that strategy on the list first and let's all agreee before changing in mid step  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the current strategy is far from perfect  \n15:06\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ok, my problem has been that I think I have has a \"rose colored glasses\" view of how the release process works.. that's all.  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the best we have ATM  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe :)  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's an interest'ing topic  \n15:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: btw, when I checked this morning, the CI failures were pointing to your commit  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I fixed them this morning AFAIK,  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n15:07\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0My thinking had been that you pick a time when nobody is committing and everything is nice and stable somewhere on or after the announced date and you release, giving the best possible version.  \n15:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: ok, all tests are still failing  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking now  \n15:09\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0My ammended thinking is you announce your intent to release and then ask if anyone has anything to commit, if delay is necessary then you delay, then after everyone is satisfied that you have committed you start trying to improve the stability of the build until the tests are all either fixed or understood.  \n15:09\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Is this accurate?  \n15:09\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0vmassol, cjd: pong, nothing to commit on my side except a small fix  \n15:10\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0So there is a \"slip under the door\" period, followed by a stabilizing period, then the release.  \n15:10\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0And it makes sense that nobody can slip anything under the door during the stabilization period, otherwise it would be endless.  \n15:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0cjd: I believe we have milestone and rc for that  \n15:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't say the release shouldn't be stable, but we shouldn't spend 1 week to stabilize a milestone  \n15:12\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0by stabilization I mean broken tests which have not been investigated/understood  \n15:13\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0whatever we really do I would like to put down in some notes just so poor saps like me don't come along thinking this is easy ;)  \n15:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:) we should definitely look more often at the state of CI (check it a few times per day)  \n15:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0otherwise you commit and then with 1 day before the release you release tests are failing on CI because of your commits  \n15:16\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0well.. ideally commits would trickle in over time and releases would be purely timeboxed but I'm not interested in changing the approach but rather understanding it.  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on my side I'm also ready  \n15:16\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0If in the process of understanding, we decide that change is necessary then that's step 2.  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we just need sdumitriu's status....  \n15:17\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0vmassol: am I right re \"My ammended thinking\" above?  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: yes it's correct with the goal of slipping the less possible ofc so the RM should start \"early\" in this process and refuse if the devs ask for too much delay compared to the release date  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too much being something we debate between ourselves here  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/too much/\"too much\"/  \n15:19\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0It seems like the RM should be basicly just a bearucrat and if the community wants to hold the release for 3 weeks then the RM does as the community asks...  \n15:20\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I mean if it's agreed to on the list then it's the community's decisions..  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that doesn't quite work out  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since that means lagging a lot  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the RM should try to observe the planned date as much as possible  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie gather eveyrone around that date  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ideally he shouldn't have to do this  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we don't live in an ideal world...  \n15:21\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0IMO we (I) need to understand exactly how it works before talking about how to improve it..  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all devs are focused on their dev work  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0while the RM has the release as an objective  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the difference  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0said harshly, the RM should consider it's his failure if the planned date is not met  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well let me rephrase that :)  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's not just about date  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also about content  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie planned roadmap  \n15:23\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I was coming from that understanding but given any developer can hold the release, that requirement becomes a little silly  \n15:23\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0but if that's how it works, lets just write it down...  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we can write it down and then improve it  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(after the release is done so that we don't mix the two)  \n15:23\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0yeap  \n15:24\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0that's my thinking, once we come to a clear understanding we can think about how to improve  \n15:24\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0trying to sweep unplesentries under the carpet makes it impossible to improve  \n15:28\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0mail sent re releasing early tomorrow.  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok
