 \n10:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you`d need to have a look over XWiki's dev guide http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/ to help you on understanding what developing in XWiki means.  \n10:25\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0How can I increase my chances of selection?

If you plan to write java components, then yes, get eclipse and read dev.xwiki.org. If you only want to focus on the UI (like the blame view project requires), all you need is an XWiki instance installed and running and a browser.  \n10:54\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0Enygma`, I am focussing on the blame view project  \n10:54\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0can you give me some relevant bugs.  \n11:12\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0pakhandibaba: you could also have a look at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/PaperCut  \n11:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0might be a place to start  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR noticed a bug with my @unstable check  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I commit some new code with @Unstable 6.4.8, 7.4.3, 8.0RC1 , it tells me that the unstable anno shoudl be removed because 6.4.8 is old now  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the rule is based on versions, not time...  \n11:54\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0has quit  \n11:55\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"the rule is based on versions, not time...\" yes but introducing a new unstable API in a x.y.8 is not exactly a best practice :)  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right\u2026  \n11:56\u00a0<Nanduni\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I put it only in 7.4.x in the end because of this  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and master ofc)  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even though I'm sure xwiki users of 6.4.8 would have loved to have it  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/would have loved/may have a need for it  \n11:57\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0has quit  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes it's a good safeguard  \n11:58\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:02\u00a0<Nanduni\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n13:31\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0Enygma`, How to set up the dev env needed for the project?  \n13:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0pakhandibaba: you`d have to be a bit more specific, as I`ve previously mentioned.  \n13:38\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0I am interested in the blame view project .
