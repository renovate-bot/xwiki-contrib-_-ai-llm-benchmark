The question is whether so set the \"typed\" field to true or false. For xwiki/2.0 I was setting this field based on the \"type\" field. From what you're saying now, for 2.1 syntax I should always set \"typed\" to true.  \n17:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: the real issue is that the WYSIWYG is putting wiki syntax in the html, this will be fixed with generic markers based on xdom+xml syntax  \n17:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we just need to move on this, putting xwiki syntax in the html always been a temporary hack  \n17:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't understand, where is the editor putting wiki syntax in html?  \n17:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: in the marker  \n17:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0no  \n17:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the marker is generic  \n17:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if it's generic then \u00a0you don't have issue...  \n17:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0false|-|url|-|http://www.xwiki.org  \n17:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I have, the first param of the marker, can be false or true  \n17:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0again if you know it's a URL you should set it to true  \n17:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the first param controls the \"typed\" field of the resource reference  \n17:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0this has nothing to do with xwiki/2.0 or 2.1 syntax this is reference informations  \n17:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, but what I'm saying is that it wasn't like this for 2.0 syntax and I need to have the same behavior for both syntaxes, ideally  \n17:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the fact that xwiki/2.0 syntax does not support explicit type is just a limitation of it  \n17:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0at you level you are supposed to generate a proper XDOM/event not wiki syntax  \n17:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's xwiki/2.0 renderer job to take care of how to write a reference  \n17:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the realy issue IMO is not what you should put in the marker but what the syntax supports or not  \n17:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and there is lots of things not supported by xwiki/2.0 syntax  \n17:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: About the empty dashboard displayed when creating a new space, I think that we need to add a \"save and view\" action for templates; right now there's edit or save and edit  \n17:56\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0y'all don't every say \"your\" I take it. Might be the effective way.  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok. mflorea was looking at it this morning, don't know what he found  \n17:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: until now we had only one syntax really editable with the WYSIWYG because we did not have either renderer or parser for others but configuring WYSIWYG feature depending on the source syntax is becoming needed  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0JuanDaugherty: you lost me\u2026 :)  \n17:57\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0<tmortagne> at you level, the typo on the front page, second slide, etc.  \n17:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: The problem would be fixed right now if we use \"save and edit\" as the template action, the WYSIWYG would find the right data in the document  \n17:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0JuanDaugherty: It's a frenchmen problem  \n17:58\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0no doubt  \n17:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not it's just a writing too quickly issue  \n18:00\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0(effective way to avoid your vs. you're, etc. just only use one uninflected word for every form of English second person)  \n18:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0JuanDaugherty: \"Your\" right  \n18:01\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0you should figure out some way to embed documentation in your product  \n18:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Anyway, I'll see if I have rights to edit the xwikicom site  \n18:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0JuanDaugherty: Working on it  \n18:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Will probably be on the roadmap for 4.x  \n18:03\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: the fact is that I have this in my code:  \n18:03\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0destination.setTyped(destination.getType() != ResourceType.URL);  \n18:03\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and I'm trying to remember why I put it for 2.0 syntax..
