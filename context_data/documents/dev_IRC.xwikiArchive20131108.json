\n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: btw you forgot to update http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/InternationalizingApplications  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm doing it now

\n09:21\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n09:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'd like to release XWiki 5.2.1 tomorrow since it contains lots of  \n09:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0important regressions... <-- nice wording  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regressions are always important?  \n09:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I want to push out a release which contains ... regressions  \n09:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0;)  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0important regression \\*fixes\\*  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or \"it fixes lots of important regressions\"  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice catch  \n09:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeap  \n09:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I just saw it and laughed  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it might actually be true :)  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0future will tell  \n09:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n09:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh re what we were talking about the other day, I think the best way to do modularity via .jar files is to have them register a single \"point of entry\" object when they are loaded  \n09:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that object can have methods for constructing all of the other parts which are available in that .jar module  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we almost do that with our components  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0each module usually provides a main component that does this module's job  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we also provide another one for scripting access)  \n09:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0perhaps instead of the annotation loader automatically knitting things together it could create the facade object  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we want that automatic wiring :)  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why we took pain to develop it  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0>global variables  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what this facade object generates are your singeltons  \n09:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the difference is that the configuration script is in charge  \n09:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so technically they are not singletons  \n09:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and when that \"init script\" becomes ugly and large, it is very obvious that refactoring is needed  \n09:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0whereas the DI method causes the mess to be spread around and hidden  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think if you wish to change things in xwiki the best is that you write a proposal and take an existing example of oode from xwiki and show us how you would write it  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0take some \"clean\" module ofc  \n09:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't think a proposal would get traction at the moment, I just want to talk about the general ideas until clean design is in the air ;)  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's always in the air :)  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but right now you're the only one seeing some big pain with what you have I think  \n09:33\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/what you/what we  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you need to convince others, hard job :)  \n09:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think this is a problem which plagues most java projects though  \n09:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0global variables cause trouble  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first you need to express the problem  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0saying global variables cause trouble is not enough  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if you feel strongly I'd write a blog post if I were you  \n09:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I actually did but it's only available in hyperboria  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I was planning on forwarding it to the list but I feel I need a conclusion  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should use scala cjd, I'm sure you'd love it  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just saw this tweet: \"As a Java programmer, Scala has thought me the value of functional programming, that is to strive to avoid state and mutable data.\"  \n09:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Actually I like the general syntax and ideals but the compile time is scary  \n09:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0we need a scala compiler in C  \n09:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Fabio told me the same thing  \n09:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0(that I should use it, not that we need a GCC frontend)  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could contribute a scala macro for xwiki ;)  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there might be a JSR232 impl somewhere  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0223  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5654888/how-do-i-set-up-jsr223-scripting-with-scala-as-scripting-language  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-874  \n09:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nice  \n09:47\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n09:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n09:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:53\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n10:59\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: hi, do you know if this test failure is a flicker: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-5.2.x/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/32/testReport/org.xwiki.test.ui.appwithinminutes/ClassEditorTest/testRenameWithSaveAndContinue/  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to start releasing 5.2.1  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I see that http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9622 is not fixed yet  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I remember a discussion between Anca and you on skype  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you made some fix for 5.3M1 AFAIR  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you think you could backport it to 5.2.1?  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not the whole thing but just the part that fixes it  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since I think you said the whole thing is too dangerous)  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: no I did not do a fix for that, I did some clean that made this bug desappear as a side effect but the conclusion of the discussion with Anca was that we needed a different fix for 5.2  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: the fix for 5.2 according to anca is to revert your commit basically as explaining in the comment she wrote  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have to move, back in 1/2h  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I need to check my commit because I don't remember working on anythin in this domain  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's something you did for auth without cookie  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's only part of your commit(s) on the subject  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only the change in MyFormAuthenticator  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah tool ate  \n11:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: from the screenshot it seems the test timed out while waiting for a long Save & Continue. I haven't seen this test failing before, but I think it's a flicker, maybe the CI was very busy/slow when the test run.  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks mflorea  \n11:28\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:47\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n11:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Hello. Seems we have some issues with out blog app from xwiki.org http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News?page=2&ipp=3 Clicking on older post deosn't work  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you try to fix it sburjan?  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm releasing 5.2.1 now and fixing some bugs first)  \n12:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I don't have the time, sorry  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then report it  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XINFRA  \n12:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: done  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thx  \n12:15\u00a0<npst>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:16\u00a0<npst>\u00a0smee again :)  \n12:16\u00a0<npst>\u00a0this time, i'm looking for a way to replace umlauts in links.  \n12:17\u00a0<npst>\u00a0i stumbled over the radeox replacement thing, but am wondering if there's a different way to do it  \n12:20\u00a0<npst>\u00a0like .. basically i want to prevent users to create wiki-pages with umlauts in the title. so maybe the page-creation is a place to look?  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0why should users not create pages with umlauts in the page name ?  \n12:25\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0aside of that one need to fix it in page rename, page copy, etc pp \u00a0... or do it on a \"low level\", which I guess means patching the core  \n12:27\u00a0<npst>\u00a0well, we've set everything from os over software up to the db to utf-8 and are still experiencing encoding problems with urls. so the replacing seemed to be a way to solve that  \n12:47\u00a0<npst>\u00a0is there a list of all those /XWiki/ pages (templates?) that contain logic and layout of certain sections of the site?  \n12:47\u00a0<npst>\u00a0like /XWiki/XWikiUserProfileSheet  \n12:54\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has quit  \n12:54\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:17\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0npst: the create page stuff actually lives on the file system, in webapps/xwiki/templates/create.vm \u00a0and createinline.vm ... I think one can override them by attaching a file with the same name to XWiki.DefaultSkin, but maybe some javascript hooks to prevent things in the UI is a bit smaller a change  \n13:18\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0aside if that umlauts should be working; it is a bug if they do not, imo  \n13:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that several pages on xwiki.org are now broken due to the move of the XEM jira project  \n13:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we renamed it to \"{RETIRED} XWiki Enterprise Manager\"  \n13:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess ideally we should have used its id  \n13:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also some RN are wrong now since we used \"category = top level projects\"  \n13:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and XEM was moved from top level to retired  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0several jira filters are also broken because of this  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess using dynamic content for release notes is an issue...  \n13:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n13:59\u00a0<npst>\u00a0thanks, camil7: in what file would i place that js, tho?  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne, mflorea: any idea if there's a risk for me to update the translations for 5.2.1?  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie some keys removed for example)  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I didn't want to take any risk I think I shouldn't update translations  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I think we probably shouldn't update translations for bug fix releases\u2026. wdyt?  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: we are never supposed to remove translations  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that would be a bug  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but it can happen  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it usually don't happen or we fix it  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we know about it  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here we wouldn't know  \n14:01\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0npst: I thought about javascript emedded in xwiki, as explained there: \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/SkinExtensionsTutorial#HMinimalJavaScripteXtension \u00a0\u00a0... not sure if it is the ideal solution, would have to \"smell\" on every pag if there is an add/copy/rename form with a page name input field  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nobody has tested 5.2.1SNAP  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: then how can we answer you :)  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex if you know for sure you removed some key  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for some reason  \n14:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I think there are some translation changes that work only in 5.3M1+  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep that too  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie some parameter changed  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if that's the case it's wrong too  \n14:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when changing paramater we are supposed to add new jey  \n14:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0key  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is why I think it's always sangerous to update translations for bug fix releases  \n14:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Edy or Louis-Marie have removed wiki syntax from translation values and update the Velocity code in 5.3M1 so they won't work in 5.2.1  \n14:03\u00a0<npst>\u00a0well, i guess i  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: there's a big difference between we shouldn't do it and we have no tool to check it  \n14:03\u00a0<npst>\u00a0'll try some different approaches. maybe even some apache reqrite would suffice :D  \n14:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for WorkspaceManager  \n14:03\u00a0<npst>\u00a0thanks again, great channel :>  \n14:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: I'm pretty sure guillaume did not break translation keys  \n14:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I talking with him about it several times  \n14:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0then Edy, let me find the commit  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: would you be confident enough to do a 5.2.2 release in case something is broken? :)  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/talking/talked/  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we need to develop some build time tool to check breakages in translation keys  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/we need/we might need  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: if you don't want to update translation don't  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some kind of \"CLIRR for translations\"  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's hte problem  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't have some fixed rule for tht  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*that  \n14:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we do have rules, now people should follow them  \n14:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfe91d79e7b6c91c688353e213ac78d9fcf39b33  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we?

I hope you'll be able to release it on contrib and on e.x.o once it's ready :)  \n14:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: there are lots of things I want to do :) especially make it even nicer. Right now I'm trying to fix the pages and go over them (I know it mayeb was not needed, but I will have a sense or organization over them). After I need to finish and import also incubator.  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: btw in case you don't know, the parents are wrong, but this can be fixed easily with a script to fix them all at once  \n14:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0they are not wrong \u2026  \n14:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I mean there are the old parents set to Design.WebHome  \n14:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and I will mark manually parent for pages that I know relate to one another  \n14:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and after we can fix them if we want them to be marked on Main.WebHome or Proposal.WebHome  \n14:39\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: anyway the parents are needed for Feature's pages in order to display a meaningful livetable for the requirements | design | implementation related pages  \n14:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: Do you know why we have a DesignArchive space? http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SpaceIndex?space=DesignArchive Who created it and what was the purpose? For example OfficeImporter exists in both spaces Design and DesignArchive http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DesignArchive/OfficeImporter  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: I created it  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0initially it was containing all finished designs  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but then I improved the design app  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and decide to have a status field  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*decided  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I've moved them back to the design space  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm surprised that the DesignArchivr still exist, let me check  \n14:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ok - since the page is a duplicate I will delete and when I'll find the other I'll see what do to with it.  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah only 2 pages  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know, probably a leftover  \n15:00\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I'm letting you check out the status and after I will delete the pages I found duplicate or move them manually.
