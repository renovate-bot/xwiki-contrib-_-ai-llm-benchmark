I working on building a extension. I wanted to know how xwiki is different from Media wiki ?  \n16:02\u00a0<sagarhani>\u00a0I'm interested in Realtime collaborative editor extension.  \n16:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0sagarhani: there are many differences :) I tried to see if I find some kind of comparison. There is http://www.xwiki.com/en/comparisons/xwiki-vs-mediawiki but I guess you should test XWiki to see the differences for yourself better.  \n16:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0sagarhani: wikimatrix again has some details http://www.wikimatrix.org/compare/MediaWiki+XWiki :) you I'm sure you can find this info yourself  \n16:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0we don't have such comparison on the xwiki.org website - maybe we should, if others think is important.  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:55\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:57\u00a0<sagarhani>\u00a0evalica: Cool.
