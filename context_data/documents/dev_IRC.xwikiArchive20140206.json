It runs well so far (instead of 5.3) As you improve the Subwiki feature I'll tried it again. Now it seems also to work in standard as I expect. Beside one point. If I remove view rights from unregisterd users in my subwiki I also cannot access my \"parent\" wiki without login.  \n11:33\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0In the \"parent\" Wiki the unregisterd users have the right to view the wiki  \n11:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0really?  \n11:38\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0I just did it once. I will now double check wiht a vanilla 5.4 Installation. Just will take some time.  \n11:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I am checking too  \n11:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0damn your are right  \n11:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Denis: do you have an idea?  \n11:43\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:53\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0gdelhumeau, kaisen: I reproduce, and it does not look to be a cache issue, I am digging\u2026  \n11:54\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Thanks, I just want to mention it as maybe others already using subwikis  \n11:55\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0seems an issue with the way we remove the rights, since I do not see the right anymore at the main wiki after a restart !  \n11:56\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0forgive me  \n11:56\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I got again confused by the new interface, it going to make crazy  \n11:56\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0+me  \n11:58\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Not shure what you mean with it removes after a restart.  \n11:59\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0If I restart the tomcat the settings are like before the restart  \n12:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I just said you should forgive me, I had been tricked by the new interface  \n12:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I really do not like that new interface, it is far too easy to confuse the main and the subwiki admin  \n12:01\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0No Problem, I can't fix it anyway so I will never be sad with someone that can :)  \n12:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0it happen to me all the time, which means there is a ergonomic issue  \n12:02\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0You mean the top menu to administrate the wiki and subwiki?

 \n14:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0then everytime you add a metadata in the xml file, it will be a problem too  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: of course  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you break backward compat if you do this  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: all we do is sending the content as it is and whatever stax writer triggered write it  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we should check stax config options for serialization  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the default stax writer changed at least for you or you used to never have \\r in your contents  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not just me tmortagne  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nothing to do with configuration, there is no configuration for this  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see any \\r in any of our xml files  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: we use DOM4J or jdom and they do have config options for serialiing xml  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I expect stax to be the same  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not for this and no we don't use dom4j or jdom for stax  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no configuration saying \"please don't escape \\r\"  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's certainly not what changed  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds more like a new dependency ovewriting the default stax writer  \n14:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: what api are you using for serializing the xml?  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: stax  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has 2 apis AFICS  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cursor api and another one  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have an event based and a call based interfaces but I doubt they use different way of serializing XML...  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you point me to our code?  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XAR module use XMLStreamWriter  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: public void setNewLine(String newLine) {  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on IndentingXMLStreamWriter  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0org.xwiki.wikistream.xar.internal.output.XAROutputWikiStream  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah that's when format is true and I guess it's false for export xar  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nothing to do with what we are talking about  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IndentingXMLStreamWriter as its name suggest is about formatting  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and it handles newlines  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even if it was true  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not the point  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not used for the content inside an element  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed it's the content element  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0here we are not really talking about newline  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the writer just what what you ask  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes since it's not done on the xml element it means it's not coming from the serializer  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and in the content you have the characters \\r and \\n  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course the \\r does not come for the serializer  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're sure you didn't change anything in our code on master reagrding new lines?  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I keep repeating that document content have \\r\\n  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, the question is why  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the XAR export does not touch in any way the content  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's not coming from my browser  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you mean why ?  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's like that since forever  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the only thiing that changed here is that \\r is escaped  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're saying that all our other docs ahve \\r but I just don't see it becuase my ide doesn't show it?  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are mixing several things, of course your browser send a \\r, that's the standard  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then the XML writer write aither \\r or &#xd;  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but then if it's \\r git remove it automatically because it's inconsistent AFAIK  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's probably possible to find some with it in very old documents  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when it's &#xd; git does not treat it as a line ending  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because it does not really know it's XML  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're saying that the change is that now stax replaces \\r with &#xd;  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK be have several dependencies that overwrite the standard stax writer but I don't know what makes one win over the others  \n14:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example as gdelhumeau told you he does had &#xd; sometimes  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but only now not before, right gdelhumeau?  \n14:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0note that I don't have then when I use Admin.Export from the admin tools  \n14:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: for a few weeks  \n14:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I can not remember when it started exactly  \n14:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0-then+them  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well since we use wikistream probabmy  \n14:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I perfectly remember that we used to have it some time ago too, not just now  \n14:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0if Admin.Export does not use wikistream, then yes, probably  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: the change of format is a pain since it means too many diffs. I guess one solution is to run all our xml through it and commit before making any change  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: there is no reason xar:format does not work with it, if it was reading properly the XML it would \"fix\" it  \n14:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0my diff tool allows me to replace all &#xd; so it is a pain but not dramaticaly  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xar:format does not use stax AFAIK so it should write \\r directly  \n14:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0or maybe you are talking about the git diff?  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I really don't see why xar:format does not support it  \n14:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because I personnaly always export the xar in a temp folder and do the diff manually, before committing  \n14:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*I do the merge manually actually  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: formatmojo is using dom4j  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would it remove the encoded \\r?  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0encoded chars are valid xml  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't understand, it supposed to parse it and end up with a \\r in a String  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no way in XML API to tell that something is escaped  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so there is absolutely no reason that when xar:format rewrite the XML it keep it escaped  \n14:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n14:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: so running mvn xar:format does not fix the issue  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it means xar:format escape \\r too  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but vmassol say that xar:format does not work at all with it so which one it is ?  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just fixed a bug in formatmojo, just retesting  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you're right  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xar:format fixes the issue  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0stax implementation is a jungle, I don't know if there is any way to force making one implementation the default  \n15:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying to find which one is escaping \\r, I guess at least we can report them that it's not fun  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that if we apply XWIKI-1543 then we don't care since content won't contain \\r anymore  \n15:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like the one that escape \\r is woodstox  \n15:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0woodstox?

 \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so technically any parser tool would now need to check the version  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to know the format  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not have anything to do with 1.1 version  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a01.1 version just indicate that the order is stable  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is just optimization that's all  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it needs to be fxied  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no spec change here  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's a backward comat bug  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0compat  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we still allow it knowing that there aren't probably lots of users doing parsing of XAR files  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and knowing that the reference implement does not have any issue with missing comment element...  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and never did  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any other changes like this you did?  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0default language maybe?  \n17:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is the default language missing in your XAR ?  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so you prefer for me to have some digging fun and discover stuff, \u2026. did you document this somewhere? the format?  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you were looking at a XAR with a missing comment element so it's a lot quicker for you to look  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't remember if the default language is optimized or not  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't really see how that was diffing  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0digging  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no exhaustive documentation simply because this change is not related to XAR  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I just keep discovering changes to the format  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the module that parse the database which does not send event for the comment because it's empty and empty string is the default for a document  \n18:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: the XAR write write the <language> and <defaultLanguage> no matter what as far as I can see  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks I've put a safeguard for defaultlanguage anyway in verify  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(verifymojo)  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/XAR write/XAR writer/  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what's the logic then  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and why we remove just comment  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when it's empty)  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not just comment  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but language is a critical element since it's part of the document unique id  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is actually few elements that are not \"optimized\"  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0only what is critical for database plumbing  \n18:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0default language and translation are important too to differentiate documents  \n18:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and translation is a boolean anyway do it's never really empty)  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the first goal of the optimization was to make easier to read test (concentrate on tested values and not systematically getting tons of default values)  \n18:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0kaisen: thanks for your help, the issue has been reported and fixed: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10021  \n18:28\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@gdelhumeau WoW that was fast, great !  \n18:28\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Will it be in the next relese?

 \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I code the same thing as AS in my own page  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would it work?  \n18:38\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because we don't use checkAccess in other places  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I call checkAccess myself in a wiki page  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can do that  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would it work?
