I don't get the upgrade button anymore. obviously, using org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-ircbot will fail because that is a pom as you said  \n11:42\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so tehre must be something about the local repo cache  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: when using advanced seach the UI calls resolve(String id, String version), right ?  \n11:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think so yes  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0asking because it does seems to call it here  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not stops on my breakpoint  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm trying to understand from where the UI find that this extension is already installed  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe getInstalledExtension() first  \n11:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep that's it, still don't understand how it can know it's a 4.2-RC-3 without asking to resolveExtension but anyway  \n11:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a04.3-rc-1 sorry  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok I think I found the issue, it's indeed related to the installed extensions repository cache  \n12:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I've reported some blockers for IE8.

It's just that if you just click continue without looking too much at the conflict then it will keep the current XWikiPreference by default which is the situation you have when you do upgrade by hand and skip XWikiPreferences by the way so it's not worst  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: can you verify what I've put in the RN  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?
