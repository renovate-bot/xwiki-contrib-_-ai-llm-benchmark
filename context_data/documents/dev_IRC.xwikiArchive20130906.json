Didn't know it was you :)  \n10:57\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0at least considering the bad English of some of the folks they are certainly native German speakers :D  \n10:57\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0and yeah, I should not use that much different nicknames, so people better know who I am ...  \n10:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0So if the translations are not reviewed, they won't be in the released version ? This is actually a question for vmassol  \n11:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: they don't need to be reviewed to be included (we skipped that part since we don't have official reviewer and most translations are not really tagged as such)  \n11:01\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0to my experience they are in the release .... it is just that it would be better if someone else has a look  \n11:02\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, tmortagne, beat me to it with a better qualified answer  \n11:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0camil7. well IMO they can always be improved. I'd say it's better to have a full german translation (even with mistakes) than having .. none  \n11:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: well it all depends how bad is the translation ;)  \n11:03\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0anyway, my post on the list was more an attempt to invite more people, considering a review for typos\" easier than making the translation ...  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I'm sure if there is mistake here it will be small mistakes  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and yes it's always better to have several people looking at translations  \n11:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, since camil7 is native german, he can't be that wrong about what he is doing  \n11:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0and indeed, the more pair of eyes, the better, but we have to deal with what we have and still try to make progress  \n11:05\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, you never know ;) \u00a0... for example in the DW I really thing the name of the buttons and the text explaining then should be better in sync  \n11:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0camil7: nobody is stopping you to improve it. I'd help but my German skills are close to 0  \n11:06\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, I hope I come to the DW this evening ... unless I hang around too much in chat ;)  \n11:06\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but now to something completely different: \u00a0a colleague of mine has a small pull request https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/145  \n11:07\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0that is for the following Solr improvment \u00a0\u00a0XWIKI-9413  \n11:07\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0we tried to add a test for that, but it came out very clumsy  \n11:07\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but maybe someone can look at it any? maybe tmortagne ?  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: sorry I totally skipped your mail, I will look at it ASAP  \n11:10\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0would be not me but \"mkresse\" in that case ... maybe I can try to drag him into chat if there is somethign to discuss  \n11:10\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but thanks for looking into it!  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: it's good to see you guys from espresto becoming active in the xwiki project :)  \n11:12\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0\u00a0yes, I hope we can keep it up at least for some while - high time we finally got to do something  \n11:12\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0btw using git to send patches helps a lot, making contributions much easier  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm sure some of you guys could become committers if you keep it up for a while :)  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/145 looks good, just one little suggestion  \n11:13\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0we will try to send more patches, it partially depends on with what our customers threaten us next  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:14\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0support for Arrays as been a bit painful, we thought  \n11:15\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but ... yes, we can add that ... me going over to mkresse to see what he says  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what you're referring to  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(re arrays)  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah you're replying to tmortagne...  \n11:16\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0sorry, me commenting on the patch 145 comment of tmortagne  \n11:16\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, maybe should comment in github instaed \u00a0... channel confusion ;)  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or just prefix your mesage with tmortagne:  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want to talk just to tmortagne  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: java.lang.reflect.Array should help with arrays  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(provide methods manipulate an array that you don't know)  \n11:23\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, we just have not been sure of we should add yet another if-branch for arrays. \u00a0mkresse is busy with some urgent mail and will look into it instantly after that  \n11:23\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0s/of/if/  \n11:25\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: if mkresse does not have time it's OK, it was just a suggestion  \n11:36\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0he should have time today ... at least for the Iterable, that is just a single word change :)  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n11:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:42\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:11\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:11\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n13:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:36\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:14\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0Hi all...
