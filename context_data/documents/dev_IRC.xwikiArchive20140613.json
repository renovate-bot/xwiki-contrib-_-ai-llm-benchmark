I saved few pages as admin and not sure if they went insecure.  \n12:45\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Or they are checked for use of protected api?  \n12:49\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0or it is just the name of \u00a0the user that last modified it?  \n12:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is the last \"contentAuthor\" of the document  \n12:56\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0So I am safe from other users?  \n12:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0in plain SQL it is something like select XWD\\_FULLNAME from xwikidoc \u00a0where XWD\\_CONTENT\\_AUTHOR='XWiki.Admin';  \n12:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you know it is only the admin who changed things  \n12:56\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0If someone else did then the content author changes and page loses rights, am I right?  \n12:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have to admit that an SQL query that checks which users have programming rights .... is a bit too mindboggeling to me  \n12:57\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0:D  \n12:57\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I am actually just trying to check if I'm safe  \n12:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, is another user \u00a0(without programming rights) \u00a0edits the content of the page, it no longer works  \n12:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0s/is/if/  \n12:58\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Okay. The query is not needed then if that works in that way.  \n12:59\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0btwm is XWiki scripting reference doc up to date?  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there are some kind of \"secure scripts\" coming up, where normal users can edit the page, as long as they leave the \"programing rights scripts\" alone  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but for now it just fails if someone changes anything on the page, to be on the safe side  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0SRD is still 5.0 , so it is not exactly up to date  \n13:01\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0So how to check the usage of things? I can get classes from javadoc, but I do not have any access to up to date object list for velocity  \n13:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have to admit I am a bit afraid of updating the thing there ...  \n13:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there have not been any big chnages to the API, especially there should not have been any removals, so it is still ok unelss you want to use someing brand new  \n13:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: We're ready to make the move  \n13:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from contrib to platform  \n13:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/xwiki-platform-mail  \n13:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you think you help me perform this move to keep the history?

 \n13:11\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0blog should not remove the search :(  \n13:22\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0ClemensR: my colleague deleted the Main space in fact...  \n13:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, thats why  \n13:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I recommend http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/RestoreSpace \u00a0\u00a0unsurprisingly  \n13:23\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0ClemensR: what a mess...  \n13:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0to get the \"Main\" space back  \n13:24\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0we restored it with the default ui but a lot of macro re missing now  \n13:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and I should get XWIKI-8320 \u00a0done some day :/  \n13:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, who restored the default ui and how ?  \n13:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0ClemensR: do you have any advice to set up a light xwiki for documentation, we want our customer to access xwiki and only see a minimal UI (custom side panel, etc)? before we break xwiki completely  \n13:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0restored from the previous revision or something  \n13:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0there was no custom macro, I'm missing the defaults ones like: \"Unknown macro: spaces\"  \n13:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, if they are not admins, they should not be able to delete too much  \n13:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0well at the moment we are trying to set up xwiki like we want  \n13:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, the macro is not listed on the XWiki.WikiMacros space ?

 \n13:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0um, I thought these cannot be trashed ... but I guess these are not listed by an xwiki page, but you need to check with the corresponding service ...  \n13:33\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0so what happened is that when you go to a space that doesn't exist anymore, if you try to delete it, it deletes the \"Main\" space  \n13:33\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0he tried to delete a space already deleted  \n13:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, that should not happen, if you can reproduce that I think this is a bug .... people would just need to double click in the remove button for that to happen  \n13:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0btw: Skin creation guide found: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Skins  \n13:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0can we delete the \"sandbox\" space without a cataclysm?
