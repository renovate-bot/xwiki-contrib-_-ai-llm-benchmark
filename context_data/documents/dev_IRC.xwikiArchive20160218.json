This is the case of the Forum Application which has Forums space, one space per created forum, one space per created topic. Now I'm working on adding support for Nested Spaces which will solve this problem, but for Pre Nested Spaces versions on XE this should be also fixed. A raised issue with a certain use case can be seen   \n09:45\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Hello!  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi alex  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the question?  \n09:49\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Some custom scripts may be run at Forum initialization and as migrator to define the rights on Forum, Topic, Answer inheriting them from Forums space.  \n09:49\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0WDYT?  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is forum init?  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how is this triggered?  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i think this mecanism of running an upgrade scirpt for a given version of an extension is sometihng that would benefit from being discussed on the list with a proposal. Maybe you could start with your idea on how you want to achieve this? unles you don't have any idea in which case you could ask the question there?  \n09:53\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0There is a #initForum macro where a WebPreferences page is created for each forum.  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: Hi  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like there is an issue with your merge for XCOMMONS-917 on 7.1  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acotiuga: how is this triggered?  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you navigate to the forum home page?  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the check is always done, even when it's not needed? I don't think know if we have a way to run some post upgrade script with EM, tmortagne?  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well you could have a listener in your XAR  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but that require PR  \n09:58\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0listening to extension installed event with the id of your extension)  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's java  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wiki component  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki component sure  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what require PR  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n09:59\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I can see there it happens on $xcontext.action == 'view' while maybe it should happen only once as its name says  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so not very good  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends if the check s expensive or not  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that over time you add more and more upgrade checks  \n10:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's about checking something in a document you would have loaded anyway then it's ok I guess  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other issue  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is if it takes some time to perform the migration  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it would be nice that the user got a progress bar  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of wondering why the home doesn't load  \n10:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n10:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n10:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone familiar with yourkit who could explain this to me: https://www.evernote.com/l/AHc0yJ9DRrdIMLcSePJpaomSL3-clegAkfg ?  \n10:16\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: looks like a local variable, not something stored anywhere so bound to the current thread  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0probably the exported pdf if it's about XWIKI-13108  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's about that issue and my comment there  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0big pdf if that's it  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very small pdf  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just one line of exported content  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0shouldn't be that big normally  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think you can see where a local variable was used but not sure where exactly  \n10:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I can click info  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it seems it retaining 16 objects  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for 67MB of total  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a015 byte[] objects  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which are ArrayList which are BAOS which are Thread objects  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there are 15 Thread objects totalling 67MB  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can see each object if i click selected objects  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0biggest is 33MB and next big one is 16MB and then the others are smaller  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I was not reading it properly. Each Theasd is holding a BAOS which is holding an ArrayList which is holding a byte[]  \n10:27\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the biggest thread is holding 33MB in byte[]  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so not much to do with PDF (or at least 13 of those threads don't have anything to do with PDF)  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*14  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what those byte[] are holding..  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the names of the threads might help  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and their stack  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok foudn another view with the threads  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the big one is the export one ofc  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a033M is still big for a PDF  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's probably before compression  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it has a BAOS of 66MB which has 15 elements from an ArrayList (totalling 66MB)  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a022 byte[] arrays, the biggest one being 33MB  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't go deeper  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the 2 issues here are:  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- hsqldb uses a lot of memory with 10 wikis  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(110MB roughly)  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure we can do anything about this one  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- the export itself seems to take a lot of memory even with some small content  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0combined, they make the JVM go beyong 512MB at some point  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*beyond  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even though in the memory dump I get 350MB used only  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm going to documet this issue with hsqldb since we're not mentioning it in the doc on xwiki.org  \n10:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe 350 is just the heap (so without the local variables)  \n10:36\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0local variable content is stored in the heap but I mean maybe it's giving the size without temporary stuff  \n10:38\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:40\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah something like that maybe  \n10:42\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:56\u00a0<lynxt\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:57\u00a0<tillo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n10:58\u00a0<lynxt\\_>\u00a0is now known as <lynxt>  \n11:00\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:00\u00a0<tillo\\_>\u00a0is now known as <tillo>  \n11:06\u00a0<KwootAtWork>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:37\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:39\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0hi folks, i am using xwiki 7.2 and i got a question regarding the watchlist. if i watch a page and there are changes made, i get notifications via rss, but not via mail. Do i have to configure it or should it work by default?  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0flashdel: you have to enable it in your user profile  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by choosing the frequency of the summary mails  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(you also need to make sure XWiki can send mail :))  \n11:41\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0oh ok, i see :) Is it possible to tell xwiki to send an email every time changes are made?

 \n14:01\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0considering that i will upgrade to 7.4.1  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0flashdel: can't really tell you sorry, not a office import expert  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria1: any idea which is the best version of libreoffice to use with XWiki ?  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0flashdel: there are version information on the office importer app page  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the answer depends on your OS too, check the info there  \n14:23\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0tmortagne: I don't know about the best version, but I would recommend 4.2, mostly because of http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11611  \n14:23\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0is now known as <msmeria>  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: have you added this info on the importer office app compat section?

 \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't fully remember our rule regarding hidden. Our Java API should honor the hidden flag right?or is it just the scripting APIs?  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see that the search API in the store doesn't honor hidden  \n16:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hidden is a filter you are supposed to use enable in your script  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/use//  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but not only  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example getSpaces() in XWiki honors hidden too AFAIK  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's an old API  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and same for lots of apis  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I wasn't sure about our rule  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those use to apply hidden all the time (was even impossible to disable the filtering)  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but getSpaces() should be deprecated for query module like other document related search APIs in XWiki if not already the case I think  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the rule is that the Java API should allow the caller to decide if hidden should be filtered or not  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0corredct?  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*correct  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the direction we took for documents  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so right now xwiki.searchAttachments() doesn't allow to pass a filter/boolean for that  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I have several choices  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- introduce a new signature  \n16:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWiki#search\\* are all very old APIs  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- add the filter in it anyway  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- modify the caller code to not use searchAttachment and redo the full HQL  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and use the query manager)  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0an alternative to \"full HQL\" is a named query  \n16:08\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now I don't think we have a hidden filter that will work with attachment, I guess it request attachment table  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so would also need to introduce an attachment filter  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*attachment hidden filter  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm good point  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0flashdel: no you should not need to do anything  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe something went wrong during xwiki.cfg upgrade  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should probably check it  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@tmortagne: actually it should work  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the query is \"\"select attach.filename, doc.fullName from XWikiAttachment attach, XWikiDocument doc where doc.id = attach.docId and \"  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the hidden doc filter adds: \"(doc.hidden <> true or doc.hidden is null)  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll try the named query direction....  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right should be ok with document filter indeed  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm it won't work with named queries since it doesn't allow to pass arbitrary where clause  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it?  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean filter won't work with a named query ?  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's possible, not sure how it's working exactly  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually we have a AbstractWhereQueryFilter  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it means adding a new filter  \n16:15\u00a0<KwootAtWork>\u00a0has quit  \n16:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't thin we have a solution for passing where clauses for named queries  \n16:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*think  \n16:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0generic solution that is  \n16:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but would be easy to add a filter for this  \n16:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could be interesting to add  \n16:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not too hard  \n16:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll try that\u2026 see if I can get one to work quickly...  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well what a filter do is adding where clause to the query, not sure we really support named queries in filters  \n16:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n16:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least what AbstractWhereQueryFilter won't work with a named query  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should work  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/3f1bf727d7834dcbf955015671030f3d77250c7f/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/store/hibernate/query/HqlQueryExecutor.java#L210-L210  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see we apply filters even when we have named queries  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we create a new query when we have filters apparently ;)  \n16:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok then, so it's not really named queries anymore but it's ok from user point of view  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only issue is passing the custom where into a QueryFilter...  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a custom query property  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like Solr does  \n17:27\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0hello  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0please, can I ask you something about user customisation and skins ?  \n17:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes xwiki\\_finstern  \n17:37\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0hello guillaume  \n17:38\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0thank you, here is my question : I received the request from some user to be able to change the app' skin  \n17:38\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so I'm looking into docs and all to find a way to allow user to select the skin of his choice without having to manually change it as an admin  \n17:39\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0but so far I havn't found any option for such a feature  \n17:39\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0Am I not looking at the right place ?  \n17:40\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0or the feature isn't avaiable ?  \n17:40\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0(namely : letting user select his favorite skin for himself, like we can find on some php forums)  \n17:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0This feature is not available out of the box  \n17:41\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok  \n17:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but  \n17:41\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so I have either to find a mods that add it (if it exist) or code it myself  \n17:41\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0but ?  \n17:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I think that you can edit the XWiki.XWikiUsers class  \n17:42\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0yes, I saw in the doc how to change the skin for individual account  \n17:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0add a String property named \"skin\" (and I suggest you also to add a \"colorTheme\" property)  \n17:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and then edit your profile with the object editor  \n17:42\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0oh you mean adding a rollover string property  \n17:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0if it works (which I suppose), then you need to add it on the UserSheet, which is the more complicated thing  \n17:43\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0modification of usersheet, ok  \n17:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0rollover?  \n17:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the user sheet is XWiki.XWikiUserSheet  \n17:44\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so if you are right, I could add the option to the user profile without having to script it or code it ?  \n17:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0actually you should change XWiki.XWikiUserPreferencesSheet  \n17:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0modifying the user sheet is a bit like coding it :)  \n17:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0that would be awesome, I will try your solution, thank you  \n17:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you could also create a JIRA issue  \n17:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0err .. yeah well you must admit it's a bit easier than going down to java code, right ? :)  \n17:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0we have never put this in our roadmap, but this is something that we always wanted to have  \n17:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0(an issue might already exist)  \n17:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's more like doing some HTML, and a bit of velocity  \n17:46\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I will try to add it to Jira issue (but as I never did this, I will need to learn)  \n17:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0directly inside the wiki  \n17:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it does not even need a restart :)  \n17:47\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok  \n17:47\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I will compile your suggestions and have a try  \n17:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0good luck :)  \n17:48\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0btw, for security matter, I used the root wiki as an administrative wiki (only avaiable for admin accounts), and my \"app\" is a subwiki  \n17:49\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0is there a way to get rid (for non admin accounts) of the \"Accueil\" button ?  \n17:49\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0it's misleading since the users don't have the right to go up to root wiki, but still have a \"home\" button  \n17:49\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I havn't found how to tweak this part  \n17:50\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0(and yes sorry it's a totally unrelated matter)  \n17:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0for your color theme thing (since I suppose you don't really want to change the skin), you could do something like:  \n17:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0<dt class=\"label\"><label>$services.localization.render('colorTheme')</label></dt>  \n17:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0in XWiki.XWikiUserPreferencesSheet  \n17:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0where are stored your users xwiki\\_finstern?  \n17:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0in the main wiki or in the subwiki?  \n17:54\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0(you are right, I don't need to change the skin already avaiable, they are nice .. I just need to let user the choice of dark or light skin, for readable comfort purpose, some people favor a white background, other want dark background, difficult to find a middleground on those matters so better give them the choice)  \n17:55\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0user are stored in the main wiki  \n17:56\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I did it this way to be able to have multiple subwiki if later on I'm asked new application, the users won't change in either case  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: regarding https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13083 is this hard to implement? Is that why it wasn't done as part of the WebHome hiding for wiki links?  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm wondering if we should have if for 7.4.2  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WDYT?  \n18:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: there are a couple of things to consider and discuss  \n18:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for example tmortagne (or mflorea, don`t remember exactly) was saying at some point that we should not generate an untyped link in wysiwyg if the user already explicitly selected the document (with the wizard), since the untyped link's behavior is pretty unpredictable right now and the user might not get what he asked for  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(don't know if it was me but I agree with that)  \n18:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the alternative (to using untyped links) would be to use the space: link type, thus avoiding \"WebHome\", but I`m not sure what we gain by that in terms of usability  \n18:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0plus that the space: link type does not work with relative links, so it would always be absolute space: links, which is not that user friendly  \n18:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0in the current implementation, wysiwyg translates everything to doc: links when editing existing or creating new links.  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes using \"space:\" for NP would already be an improvement IMO  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since WebHome would be hidden and it would correspond more to what the user would type)  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0remving \"space:\" altogether would be the best though  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie untyped link)  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to know more with examples about the pitfalls with untyped links  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not here, best is to comment on the issue to keep a trace of the issues  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0hey  \n18:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0good night here  \n18:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0thank you gdelhumeau \u00a0for your solution and assistance  \n18:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:46\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:58\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:40\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:03\u00a0<tdi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:03\u00a0<tdi>\u00a0hi, is there a way to delete faq item that is with '/' in the title?  \n23:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:38\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:46\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n23:53\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
