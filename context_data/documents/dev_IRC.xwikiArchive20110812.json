I could have sworn I had to do something with its config last time.  \n04:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, let's start with the xwiki war  \n04:47\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay, I brought it down with wget last time.  \n04:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a03.1 is OK?  \n04:48\u00a0<amon>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wget http://download.forge.objectweb.org/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise-web-3.1.war  \n04:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I use our maven repo usually  \n04:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But it should be the same  \n04:49\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Doesn't matter to me, that's just the one I happened to hit first  \n04:50\u00a0<amon>\u00a0we may also need to apt-get install unzip  \n04:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Right  \n04:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, that was bad  \n04:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Should have used:  \n04:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0unzip -d xwiki xwiki-enterprise-web-3.1.war  \n04:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Next, the mysql connector  \n04:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0From http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/  \n04:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ah, doesn't work with wget  \n04:54\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I ran across that as well. I had to move it another way to get it there  \n04:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Works with links  \n04:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, got it there  \n04:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Now let's change the hibernate configuration  \n04:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Commented the default hsql section, uncommented mysql, removed the sessionvariables parameter from the connection URL  \n04:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Let's see if it works so far  \n04:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ha, would you look at that  \n04:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0An error  \n04:58\u00a0<amon>\u00a0interesting. Those are the same errors I had.  \n04:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So it's not you, it's a real problem  \n04:58\u00a0<amon>\u00a0And most of what we've done so far maps pretty close what I did  \n04:59\u00a0<amon>\u00a0So I was not tearing my hair out in vain!  \n05:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That line from the log looks promising  \n05:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, there's an empty line at the start of this file  \n05:01\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I have seen in some documents a suggestion of setting TOMCAT6\\_SECURITY=NO  \n05:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I wonder how it got there  \n05:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, the error is different  \n05:03\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Still the same basic error I could not get rid of though.  \n05:03\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Ah, binary file viewing!  \n05:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, the file is corrupt  \n05:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think we should transfer it somehow else, since links failed to get it properly  \n05:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Can you sftp it from your computer?  \n05:04\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I will take a look. I think I have a copy around.  \n05:05\u00a0<amon>\u00a0yep, I will rsync it over.  \n05:06\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay, I dropped it in /root  \n05:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, let's try again  \n05:07\u00a0<amon>\u00a0let me just get it straight what you did. You unzip'd that file into the lib?  \n05:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No, just listed its contents  \n05:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0unzip -l  \n05:07\u00a0<amon>\u00a0ah, it went by too fast for me to see  \n05:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Error, again  \n05:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0What, again?  \n05:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Cannot load JDBC driver class 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'  \n05:10\u00a0<amon>\u00a0yep.

Your going to end up banning me for asking so many questions sorry. but how can i add the output of velocity to a table, from this: #foreach($prop in $class.properties) \u00a0\u00a0; \u00a0$prop.prettyName: $doc.display($prop.getName()) \u00a0#end  \n19:00\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0i thought that would be simple, but im struggling slightly  \n19:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't mind the questions, I'm just visiting my mom this week so I'm in and out. Forgive me for the slow answers sometimes.  \n19:02\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0not a problem at all, family always comes first anyways :)  \n19:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think $doc.display() gets the \"selected object\" from the document (which is a bad concept IMO)  \n19:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0getObject(String classname) <-- that will get the first object of the given class  \n19:06\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0#set($obj = $doc.getObject('MyClass'))  \n19:06\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0$obj.getProperty($prop.getName()) <-- try that  \n19:14\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0ahh wait. im doing something wrong because thats not working. the last line you sent goes inside the foreach right?  \n19:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0correct, the last line inside of it and the other line before the #foreach  \n19:17\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0all the fields look like this: com.xpn.xwiki.api.Property@dfb948  \n19:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh  \n19:18\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0lol thats what i said.  \n19:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh sorry  \n19:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0$obj.get($prop.getName()) <-- try that  \n19:19\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0okay yes that works. \u00a0nice.  \n19:20\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0so how can i get each one of those properties into a table?  \n19:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0just use your script to generate the syntax for a table  \n19:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax#HTables  \n19:24\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0i tried that yesterday, just adding in either the \"|\" or <tr> etc and it wouldnt work. i wasnt sure if it was bc it was in the velocity tags?  \n19:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0After the velocity is finished parsing, the XWiki rendering engine will render what comes out of the velocity macro.  \n19:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0you can put it inside of a literal block so that you see the raw syntax by putting a {{{ above it and a }}} beloc it.  \n19:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*below  \n19:33\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0:(  \n19:34\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0sorry, the braces above and below what, just the | ?  \n19:35\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0its not processing it if i do {{{ | }}}, just puts the bar in front of the property  \n19:39\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0what the {{{ and }}} do is make the XWiki rendering engine not parse the content inside of it  \n19:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that way you can diagnose whatever issue you are having making a table.  \n19:41\u00a0<qwebirc77569>\u00a0okay i see what your saying then  \n20:10\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0hi sdumitriu  \n20:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi  \n20:11\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0I see there is no support at all for some kind of parameters with the new event stream API  \n20:12\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0is this something you didn't want on purpose ?  \n20:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No  \n20:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's something that I didn't want to go into right away  \n20:13\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0OK  \n20:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I didn't like the param1 -> param5 way of doing it  \n20:13\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yes...  \n20:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So I just mapped what I needed to some of those params  \n20:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Trying to make each one stand for the same thing  \n20:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Do you have a specific need at the moment?  \n20:13\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0wouldn't just a setParameters(List<String>) make sense ?  \n20:14\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yes, I do, but as a platform consumer  \n20:14\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0not for the platform itself  \n20:14\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0so \"business\" parameters  \n20:15\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0I think the event API ultimately will need this ability to store \"free form\" params  \n20:16\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0the activtystream APIs with setParam1 setParam2 etc. are bad I agree  \n20:16\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0but the need is real  \n20:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I agree  \n20:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0How many params do you need?  \n20:17\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0hehe...  \n20:18\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0If I say more than 3, it's going to be harder to fit in the AS  \n20:18\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0:P  \n20:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n20:18\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0honestly I don't know yet  \n20:18\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0but 3 would be good enough I think  \n20:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Note that there's also the event body and related entity that you can use, if the semantic fits  \n20:19\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0related entity has to be an entity though ?  \n20:19\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yes  \n20:20\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0so I would like to add Event#setParameters(List<String>) and store parameters from param3 to param5, WDYT ?  \n20:20\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0and log a warning if there are more than 3 ?

Got it working at links http:localhost:8080/xwiki but not getting the vhost showing up remotely. Can you pop into the test machine and take a look?  \n22:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sure  \n22:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Same address?  \n22:49\u00a0<amon>\u00a0yep, if I got your ssh key transferred correctly...  \n22:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Asks for password  \n22:49\u00a0<amon>\u00a0hmmm... let me check again.  \n22:51\u00a0<amon>\u00a0try again...  \n22:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Same  \n22:54\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay, it was truncated. try now  \n22:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm in  \n22:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Works on 8080  \n22:55\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay. I should have everything set up that we went through last night unless you slipped a command through on me when I wasn't looking... which you did seem to have done on an 'a2enmod proxy' that I had to do to get apache2 to load the vhost file  \n22:57\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I have tried to compress the procedure as much as possible, ie I apt-get everything need right at the start of the HowTo  \n22:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think you forgot to enable proxy\\_ajp  \n22:58\u00a0<amon>\u00a0where is that?  \n22:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0a2enmod proxy\\_ajp  \n22:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep, works now  \n22:59\u00a0<amon>\u00a0ah, so is that instead of a2enmod proxy or in addtion to it?  \n22:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Addition  \n22:59\u00a0<amon>\u00a0You slipped that one right by me...  \n23:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+ you need to disable the default site, since otherwise it takes precedence and tries to respond for /xwiki/ as well  \n23:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or lower its priority  \n23:00\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I disabled it on my first test. I had not yet done it here. I will add that note as well.  \n23:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0a2dissite default  \n23:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So you were missing two commands:  \n23:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0a2dissite default  \n23:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0a2enmod proxy\\_ajp  \n23:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay, I'll continue with the next part of the how to then, the initial set up of the XWiki with the xar file install. And then I'll make a nice clean document and send it to you.  \n23:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Although I might try one more run through on a virgin copy of the VM, just to be sure to be sure.  \n23:11\u00a0<amon>\u00a0according to my notes I logged in as Admin/admin, but it seems not to accept it. Did you set something specific that I didn't notice?  \n23:11\u00a0<amon>\u00a0http://wiki.immortaldata.net/xwiki/bin/loginsubmit/XWiki/XWikiLogin  \n23:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Don't login  \n23:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Just click on wiki -> administer  \n23:15\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay, I might note that on my screen the colors make the print almost unreadable.  \n23:17\u00a0<amon>\u00a0got it. we were both working the web browser at the same time last night and my notes got a bit confused.  \n23:18\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n23:18\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:30\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Okay, success. I have a full set of instructions start to finish. I'll have to run through fresh one more time but I think I've captured all the steps this time. Thanks again.  \n23:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You're welcome  \n23:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It would be good to put the end notes on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationOnUbuntu  \n23:38\u00a0<amon>\u00a0hmmm... doesn't seem at all obvious how to change the Admin user password to something safe...  \n23:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0amon: just go to that user page and click \"change password\" :)  \n23:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you'll need to have the rights of course)  \n23:42\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Administration \u00bb Users & Groups \u00bb Users and then I select the only existing user, Admin for 'Manage' and I see no password option.  \n23:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Click on your username in the upper right corner  \n23:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Administrator  \n23:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0amon: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/User+Management#HChangingauser27spassword  \n23:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:47\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Thanks. will look. Have to run now, only 15m before a telecon, then followed by a scheduled server maint... will be a few hours before I can get back to it.  \n23:49\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Biggest problem is the white text on light grey on the tool bar is totally unreadable on my screen.  \n23:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Click refresh  \n23:56\u00a0<amon>\u00a0So why did a refresh make it change color?  \n23:56\u00a0<amon>\u00a0That will have to go in the HowTo as well!  \n23:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Normally, it shouldn't have been needed  \n23:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Let me think a bit  \n23:57\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Ok. I have to go dial in on my telecon. Will check back in an hour.  \n23:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No idea, probably because you had an older version in the cache from the previous installation  \n\n"}
