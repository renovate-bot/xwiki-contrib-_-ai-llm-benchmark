First I'm not able to reproduce the query problem today, the only problem remaining on my computer is the unexecuted (not found) velocity macro, but of course it doesn't happen when I execute xwiki in debug mode (would be too easy)  \njvdrean - (12:12): I really could use suggestions here because I'm running out of ideas  \njvdrean - (12:13): note that the macro problem also appear on Main.WebHome (recent changes) when tests are executed, but not when I try by hand on the same distrib, and not when I execute tests on xwiki started in debug mode  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 12:20  \nsdumitriu - (12:21): jvdrean: Logging  \nsdumitriu - (12:22): Add lots of logs in the velocity related class and see what's not right  \nmariusbutuc - (12:54): What is the XWiki Syntax 1.0 version of the Include Macro?  \nmariusbutuc - (12:54): {{include document=\"SpaceOf.DocumentToInclude\"/}}  \nsdumitriu - (12:54): #includeTopic(\"SpaceOf.DocumentToInclude\")  \nmariusbutuc - (12:54): thanks sdumitriu  \nmariusbutuc - (13:00): If I have #includeTopic('Code.Macros')  \nmariusbutuc - (13:01): yet Code.Macros is written in syntax 2.0, the macros inside will not work, right?  \nmariusbutuc - (13:01): they will not be accessible in the initial document, that made the include?  \nsdumitriu - (13:09): If you have macros in that document, use #includeMacros(\"Code.Macros\")  \nsdumitriu - (13:09): You must use double quotes on #includeMacros to work  \nsdumitriu - (13:10): I'm not sure it will work, though, combining 1.0, 2.0 and macros is very tricky  \nsdumitriu - (13:18): Hm, I've been working on a test for XWIKI-5317, but I can't make it work, there's no way to forget the session  \nsdumitriu - (13:19): Ah, there is  \nsdumitriu - (13:20): getDriver().manage().deleteCookieNamed(arg0)  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 13:44  \nsdumitriu - (13:58): Hehe, wrote a new ui-test  \nsdumitriu - (13:58): It's nice  \nsdumitriu - (13:59): Lot of work needed first to fill in all the different Page implementations  \nsburjan - (14:06): shouldn't we create some internal standard for writing tests ?  \nsburjan - (14:06): I mean so tests on the same module/functionality to have some degree of uniformity  \nsburjan - (14:27): hello guys.
