Supporting themes should work OOB. For templates it's more complex since we need to replace static calls with dynamic ones  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that correct?  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0templates == skin for us  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whereas theme == theme  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIU  \n18:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0This is what we should achieve indeed  \n18:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0actually, the way I see theme is a set of variables that are used when we compile the style.css with the bootstrap support  \n18:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0if a reseller sell a custom CSS files, it does not match my set of variables system  \n18:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but it should be quite easy to define a new theme and to put it on extensions.org  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the point of using bootstrap was to standardize on HTML id/class, no?  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so these should be fixed and the CSS should work OOB  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex for a label I see bootstrap uses:  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<span class=\"label label-default\">Default</span>  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so \"label\" and \"label-default\" are known classes  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and any boostrap theme should know about those and style them  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that shouldn't require any adaptation  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: what am I missing?  \n18:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't think it is abouit standardize our HTML  \n18:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0to me it is just a good CSS framework  \n18:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0that provdes good component  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not what we discussed when we decided to adopt it  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and with the help of LESS (or SASS) you can bind our own class to the bootstrap classes  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's just a bridge and shouldn't change anything  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the point is in supporting bootstrap classes  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either directly or through LESS/SAAS  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why do you say that a bootstrap CSS theme will not match?  \n18:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because a bootsrap css will never have all xwiki specific classes and bugfix we need  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it shouldn' thave xwiki classes!  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should have bootstrap classes  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and xwiki should use the bootstrap classes)  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(directly or with the bridge)  \n18:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and when boostrap release a vcersion 4, we rewrite everything?  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and yes we need to be careful to use existing bootstrap classes instead of having our own)  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it's either a new skin or we use LESS/SASS to bridge the gap  \n18:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0then we should rewrite all our applications  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't understand what I mean  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't matter if we have:  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki-layout  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as a class)  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it maps to default-layout in bootstrap  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a 1 to 1 mapping  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if we have xwiki-layout and NO mapping then it's an issue  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is if we have complex CSS that don't map to existing bootstrap classes  \n18:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but the theme reseller needs to give his overrided bootstrap sources  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if this happens we need to discuss it and possibly simply it  \n18:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0if not, we cannot map to his work  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and possibly rewrite the part of those apps yet  \n18:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0if he distributes only the generated CSS files, we are dead  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n18:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok, 2 sec  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me CSS != content  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0CSS = style  \n18:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Let immagine  \n18:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have \u00a0a class called xwikicomment  \n18:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0With Less, I do this thing: .xwikicomment{ .make-xs-column(12); }  \n18:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0.make-xs-column is a bootstrap mixin so my style.less file is a Mapping file  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0make-xs-column is a bootstrap class?  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it is a mix-in, not a class  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what a mix in is for bootstrap but ok\u2026 :)  \n18:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's more like a parametrizable class  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so if the reseller sell me a bootstrap.css file, I'm dead  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why?  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still don't understand the problem  \n18:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because I don't know how we would interpret make-xs-column(12);  \n18:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*he  \n18:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0-we+he  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you said this was a bootstrap thing  \n18:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but he can have ovverided it  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I fail to understand everything but you are saying that bootstrap themes are useless  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because there's no standatrd  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you can't swap one theme for another  \n18:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it seems there's no product using bootstrap where you can swtich the thee  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*theme  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with a button click)  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I find this strange  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because for me that was the promise of bootstrap  \n18:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I do not know them  \n18:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I know a bit Wordpress, and they have their own theme mechanism  \n18:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0well, as soon as you don't use LESS  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example when I go to bootstrap theme creator  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can change the value and I see the result in WYSIWYG for some of them  \n18:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you can change your website look just by changing the CSS, yes  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it works  \n18:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and the \"standardized\" classes will help  \n18:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but then we will not have the mapping for old code  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought LESS would take care of that  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to convert our classes in bootstrap classes  \n18:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0hmm  \n18:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it takes the content of the bootstrap class and it put it in our own class  \n18:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but they also offer mixins: ie a class with a parameter  \n18:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and we need the less source for handle them  \n18:57\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Pong  \n19:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: it was about the prototype upgrade which caused a lot of stuff to fail in the build thereafter.
