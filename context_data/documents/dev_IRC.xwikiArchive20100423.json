 \nvmassol - (09:21): yes thomas mentioned it on the list yesterday  \nDenis - (09:21): I could make the merge, but the release is still out of my reach  \nvmassol - (09:21): what merge?  \nvmassol - (09:21): it's already merged  \nDenis - (09:22): do not have receive the commit ?  \nvmassol - (09:22): (haven't checked the last fix from CalebJamesDeLisl though)  \nDenis - (09:22): let me check svn...  \nvmassol - (09:22): but what I mean is that 2.2.6 in general already contains some merge  \nDenis - (09:23): yes but not the last one  \nDenis - (09:23): do you want me to merge it ?  \nvmassol - (09:23): the release is not out of your reach  \nvmassol - (09:23): since we have a release process as I mentioned yesterday  \nvmassol - (09:23): it's documented  \nDenis - (09:23): yes but I need to be used to it  \nvmassol - (09:23): yes  \nvmassol - (09:23): but that means trying to do it :)  \nDenis - (09:24): I know, I have even quickly read it already :)  \nvmassol - (09:24): let's see what thoma think  \nDenis - (09:24): but is it really time for a try ?  \nvmassol - (09:24): either he wants to do it  \nvmassol - (09:24): yes  \nvmassol - (09:24): or you do it with our help  \ngvallarelli joined #xwiki at 09:36  \ngvallarelli - (09:36): 'morning  \nDenis - (09:37): vmassol: selenium test seems to be pending, this probably why caleb has not merged already  \ntmortagne - (09:38): vmassol, Denis: i'm ok with helping Denis to do the 2.2.6 if he wants to do it  \ntmortagne - (09:43): [ANN]: Denis is 2.2.6 release manager  \nvmassol - (09:45): cool, thanks denis  \nDenis - (09:45): vmassol: I am not use to Hudson, why all jobs is pending on agent-1 and agent-2 does nothing ?  \nvmassol - (09:46): agent-2 is reserved for our functional tests only I think  \nvmassol - (09:46): ah no  \nvmassol - (09:46): it'es the opposite  \nvmassol - (09:46): I'll stop the build  \nDenis - (09:46): ok, so it is very long, since the 2.3 test is not passed since caled commit  \nDenis - (09:47): vmassol: should I create an account on hudson ?  \nvmassol - (09:48): done  \nvmassol - (09:48): Denis: if you want, but you won't need it for the release i think  \nDenis - (09:49): if I do not need it, I dont  \nDenis - (09:50): vmassol: it is the 2.3 branch we need to test  \nDenis - (09:51): could you shedule that first ?

Something like binding the RESTful API URIs to v1/... v2/... etc.  \nfmancinelli - (13:40): It's alway the same problem with changing APIs. This applies to REST as well  \njvdrean1 - (13:42): jvelociter: +0  \njvelociter - (13:42): fmancinelli: I'm going to comment it with \"since 2.3\"  \njvelociter - (13:43): but that would be an idea to discus  \ntmortagne - (13:43): jvelociter: +0  \nsdumitriu - (13:46): fmancinelli: This is an optional addition, it's not mandatory, so no APIs break; thus, we don't need to create a new version  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 13:47  \nfmancinelli - (13:47): sdumitriu: Yes. Actually I was talking in general... eventually we will break the API :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:50): Just reverted 4755 patch, still no livetable in tests. Maybe tmortagne should look at it?  \nvmassol1 - (13:51): jvelociter: +0 provided it's not pushing back the release  \nvmassol1 is now known as vmassol ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \ntmortagne - (13:53): CalebJamesDeLisl: did not looked what you are talking about but i will certainly not have time to look at anything today  \ntmortagne - (13:53): have to go now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:53): Ok. I'm reverting your patches from yesterday to test again.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:53): (locally)  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 13:58  \nDenis - (14:13): CalebJamesDeLisl: I am about to commit the merge of your changes for 4755 onto 2.2 branche, anything against ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:14): Go ahead, I was going to do that myself, also I didn't get the trunk yet (went backwards this time).  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:14): I'm trying to hunt down the source of this missing livetable  \nsdumitriu - (14:14): RT @alexanderhanff \u00a0preparing a criminal complaint against Canonical over privacy concerns \u00a0raised by logging/publishing of online chatrooms  \nsdumitriu - (14:15): I don't see the problem with publishing IRC logs, as long as we mention this. WDYT?  \nlucaa - (14:16): +1. Is there a way to put a longer welcome message where to tell them that if they don't agree they should get out et all?  \nsdumitriu - (14:17): I don't that's needed, it's their choice to stay  \nsdumitriu - (14:17): We did mention it's logged, it's their problem if they don't understand what that means  \nlucaa - (14:17): yes, but we need to make sure they know it. However, it;s also written at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/IRC that it's logged and public so they should read stuff carefully  \nlucaa - (14:18): (like, make sure there is a way to know that it's logged before you actually join it -- logging your join can be a privacy issue too)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:19): Hahahaha... If it's an issue I'll log the chat. In USA the test is \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" I don't expect this guy's argument will hold water though.  \nfmancinelli - (14:27): lucaa: Actually a join \"welcome message\" with the warning should be enough I think.  \nlucaa - (14:27): (the chat topic says it's logged, which works as a welcome message, so it could be enough)  \nfmancinelli - (14:29): lucaa: Yes, but it might be hidden if the window is not too large, or simply overlooked. A direct, private message sent to the user each time she joins the channel would solve any problem  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:31): The most important question IMO is \"is what we do wrong?\" If we are doing what we believe to be right and lawful then we get a protection under the doctrine of \"color of right\".  \nfmancinelli - (14:46): CalebJamesDeLisl: Maybe nothing, but since segiu raised the question... I think that being more explicit on the logging policy with a direct message doesn't cost anything and, imho, it's a better way to communicate this policy than using a chat topic or some disclaimer in a wiki document on the web.  \nCiprian joined #xwiki at 14:48  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:48): If you want to change it because you think it should be clearer, I see no problem with that but if you are afraid of somebody hacking the law and using it to attack us then I don't think there is anything which is enough to satisfy them.  \nfmancinelli - (14:48): CalebJamesDeLisl: At least you can make it harder for him :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:49): eg: if we make if a welcome message, they may argue that they forget and need reminders.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:50): Give them reminders and they argue that they should have a popup asking them if they really want to post since it's logged. It never ends.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:56): I say do what you believe is right even if you are the only one. You will feel good about yourself and if a litigious person wishes to complain you are in a good situation. see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color\\_%28law%29  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:57): That is just one man's opinion ;)  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 15:08  \nflorinciu left at 15:31 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 15:39  \nmflorea - (15:40): vmassol: what's the easiest way to get document/attachment reference when I have the wiki, space, page, fileName parts?  \nmflorea - (15:40): get=create a doc/attachment reference object  \njvelociter - (15:41): Is is just me or we have an issue with SVN ?  \njvelociter - (15:41): Jerome-Velociters-iMac:trunks jvelociter$ svn up  \njvelociter - (15:41): svn: OPTIONS of 'https://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/trunks': could not connect to server (https://svn.xwiki.org)  \njvelociter - (15:42): (though I can browse the SVN from web)  \njvelociter - (15:42): ah wait  \njvelociter - (15:42): it's probably just me :)  \njvdrean1 - (15:51): jvelociter: have you added/removed containers for the livetable lately ?  \njvelociter - (15:51): not since the last one we've talked  \njvelociter - (15:52): is there an issue ?  \njvdrean1 - (15:52): ok, no modification since the discussion with Denis about filters ?  \njvelociter - (15:52): modifications yes, but no container changes  \njvelociter - (15:52): is there an issue with the livetable ?  \njvdrean1 - (15:53): jvelociter: func tests doesn't seem to find the livetable anymore, CalebJamesDeLisl should be able to tell you more about this  \njvelociter - (15:53): maybe I can help, I'm done with the REST commit now  \njvelociter - (15:53): which test is failing CalebJamesDeLisl ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:54): 6 tests. It waits forever and shows no table. Testing now with 28540 reverted.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:54): Failing tests are in CommentTest  \njvelociter - (15:55): ok. it's selenium1 test ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:56): Yes. Strange thing is it works in practice with postgres and hsql. Just not in test.  \nplunden left #xwiki at 15:56  \njvdrean1 - (15:57): CalebJamesDeLisl: you tried the jetty+hsqld distrib from tests target/ dir >  \njvdrean1 - (15:57): ?  \njvelociter - (15:57): CalebJamesDeLisl: have you tried to run it in debug mode ?  \njvelociter - (15:57): to see what happen ?  \njvelociter - (15:57): (just building 2.3 XE now)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:58): jvdrean1: No I have been testing from distribution-test/selenium-tests/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:59): I havn't tried debug mode, can I pass it as a parameter to jetty?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:59): Removing r28540 has fixed the tests.  \njvdrean1 - (15:59): yes but did you try distribution-test/selenium-tests/target/xwiki-enterprise-\\*/start\\_xwiki.sh manually to see if you were able to reproduce ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:00): I have not. First I have to rebuild web...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:02): hmm must remember this start\\_xwiki.sh. I have only been playing with tests by hanging selenium with a sleep statement inside an infinite loop ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:04): while(2!=3){try{Thread.sleep(10000);}catch(Exception e){}}  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:05): Nice trick because you can stop the test in a particular state.  \njvelociter - (16:05): ok it seens to timeout on the right editor  \njvelociter - (16:08): CalebJamesDeLisl: jvdrean1 the issue is real, not only in selenium tests  \njvelociter - (16:08): there's a JS error when displaying the right editor on a page  \njvelociter - (16:08): I'll handle it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:10): Anyone know why jobs are bound to hudson slaves? This might have been caught earlier if these tests had run faster.  \njvelociter - (16:14): my bad for the right editor issue. It was a typo in my last refactoring :(  \njvdrean1 - (16:16): CalebJamesDeLisl: we did this to avoid bottlenecks, if the jobs were not tied we'd often have tests executing on both agents (which means no module builds for approx 1h)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:17): I see. Of course the other problem is that when a build hangs, the other builds stop until someone with enough privilege sees it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:18): \"typo in my last refactoring\" my most common mistake I think.  \njvelociter - (16:18): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:19): \"oops I'll just change this, commit, done.\"  \njvdrean1 - (16:19): CalebJamesDeLisl: well we'd probably end up with builds hang on all the agents :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:20): Maybe so. When I get a bigger computer I might be able to volunteer it to do builds.
