 \n13:51\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I didn't do a full test for 5.1  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no no  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm defintiely not talking about full test  \n13:52\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I only looked at the jira issues and also tested Solr  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you did that for RC1 already  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as usual you need to l ook at the release notes  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and test the new stuff specficially  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki51  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0menu app is new in 5.1  \n13:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I see  \n13:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'll look at it now  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n13:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0np  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw guys, I wonder if we shouldn't put back the \"resolved\" state in the jira workflow with the rule that devs mark issues as resolved and someone else than the assignee put it as closed only after he's tested it to work  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: note that I was wrong and the menu app is there since RC1  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(see http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki51RC1)  \n14:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0it's the first I hear about it, but from now on I'll look closer at the RN :)  \n14:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0usually I only looked at the Jira issued fixed for that version  \n14:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0but new features must work also  \n14:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0issues\\*  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes RN is the most important to look at  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it contains everything to be tested usually  \n14:12\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0istn the Application.properties with the translations generated from i10n.xwiki.org ?  \n14:13\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0er, I meant http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/L10N/  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, except for the English version AFAIK  \n14:13\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, I see :)  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I may we wrong...  \n14:14\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0no, english is actually missing, I only see now ... should have checked before  \n14:18\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the english is the reference one and is not exported from l10n wiki yes  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which means that we need PR for english translations  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0technically it's not really the english version but the default version  \n14:22\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:26\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, it is even mentioned ion l10n, I was just no lazy to read :-/ \u00a0.... to have an en-translation one would need to have an Application\\_en.properties ... and then that would be redundant to the default version.  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we could have english variants (but that means we would need to be clear on which variant is the default one)  \n14:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I get the DW each time I create a new wiki on XEM  \n14:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0on 5.2-snap  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: do you have the snapshot repository in your xwiki.properties ?  \n14:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least did you have it when you created the template  \n14:33\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: no and no  \n14:33\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I didn't modify any file in the zip  \n14:33\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'm on jetty/hsqldb/manager  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is a jira issue about that already, the issue is that the template is created from a xar so if XWiki cannot find the corresponding extension on any repository when it's imported it does not register it as extension  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which mean DW thing you don't have any installed extension in your new wiki  \n14:34\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok. just wanted to let you know  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9194  \n14:37\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0yes, that's exactly my issue too  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<Guest81988>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n14:53\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n14:53\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n14:53\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n14:55\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:11\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n15:12\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:14\u00a0<Guest81988>\u00a0has quit  \n15:14\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n15:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:14\u00a0<Guest81988>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:19\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:21\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:27\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:29\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n15:30\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:39\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n15:49\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:12\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0it seems the l10n.wiki.org \u00a0has no page for the translation of 'no' \u00a0(while it has one for 'yes')  \n16:13\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0just wondering, because most of the dialogs (\"do you really want to ....\") are using them, and the translations are missing at least for 'de'  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: there is a key named \"no\" ?  \n16:14\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, e.g. used in templates/resubmit.vm: \u00a0$services.localization.render('no')  \n16:15\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0also in templates/delete.vm  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right there is one in ApplicationResources.properties  \n16:19\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, it is not in the search, but one can \"guess\" is ... \"Yes\" document is here: http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/inline/Platform/PlatformXWikiCoreResources\\_119527\\_yes\\_de  \n16:20\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0so \"no\" document might be here: http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/inline/Platform/PlatformXWikiCoreResources\\_119528\\_no\\_de \u00a0... ah, no, it is not  \n16:21\u00a0<Guest81988>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0page seems to exist, but has no L10NCode.TranslationClass object  \n16:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looking  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there seems to be something weird with this key indeed, even the yes one actually, can't find it on default side  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying to understand what is the issue, good catch  \n16:30\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0maybe the mechanism creating the pages on l10n from the Application.properties does not really like such short keys  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see why but yes for some reason theses keys have not been created  \n16:39\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n16:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not seems to be a short key issue since I can find keys like http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/inline/Platform/PlatformXWikiCoreResources\\_3707\\_to\\_en  \n16:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0might be more by move from XE to Platform that broke some pages...  \n16:47\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, ok, seems I just found one my accident  \n16:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: just imported them  \n16:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was about to say It :)  \n16:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no I need to find why the scheduler that is supposed to do this import every night obviously does not work anymore  \n16:58\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, ok, so \"sort by last modified\" helps to find them ?  \n16:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/no/now/  \n16:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did not really fixed anything actually  \n16:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just forced what is supposed to be done every night  \n16:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which imported the missing keys  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and yes you should find them by looking at latest modified documents  \n17:01\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0tmortagne: ah, now I see the 'no' document, thanks!  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there was actually quite a few missing keys...  \n17:01\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0even in the \"normal\" i10n search ...  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lets see that scheduler now...  \n17:02\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0sometimes even a scheduler needs a bit personal attention from time to time ;)  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea, what is really missing is an isolated log of what happen during the last scheduler execution, like we have for extensions install and all stuff based on new job module  \n17:05\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0btw as we are at strange things I see on the start page on www.xwiki.org a reference to \"Mavenbook\" by Mavenbook.org \u00a0which links to a \"Main/No longer available\" page  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed, no idea what it was supposed to link to  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol ?  \n17:08\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0maybe the \"random selection\" of the \"Powered by XWiki\" widget also select outdated references  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0catching up  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that was my book  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't exist any longer  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the book still exists but not the web site ;))  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok broken links should be fixed now  \n17:22\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, I see (or more precise I do no longer see them)  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yah I had to refresh the cache  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're seeing another ref for now  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if you go to http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/References/Mavenbook there's no broken links any longer  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: maybe you can help us understand the email from Matthias Schoeppe?  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he says  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"What is with your page  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/References/WebHome ?  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't understand what is the question  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any idea?  \n17:25\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0reading ...  \n17:27\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, two possible explanations: \u00a0when he looked at th references, maybe the page was broken (might just been a glitch in his browser, or a timeout when getting ajax results from the livetable due to a perturbation in the force)  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll ask anyway thought maybe it's was a bad german translation :)  \n17:28\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0or he just did not like the first references, or even missed the \"paging\" buttoin in the lower rigth, assuming it is only 15 refs there  \n17:29\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0or it was something completely else - maybe he really things 127 references are not many ;)  \n17:30\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0anyway, even if one assumes this is German English, I still understand it as \"looks like there are only very little references\"  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I just replied  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thzanks  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0it seems the extension manager in the Wiki Admin UI is not much useful for users without programming rights; i.e. they cannot install or update anything  \n17:54\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0would it be better not to hide this part to all uses except users with programming rights ?  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: You mean hiding the EM UI for admin users without PR?  \n17:57\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0vmassol: yes, something like that  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's not already the case then yes we should do this  \n17:59\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0as users who only exists in virtual wikis have no programming rights it seems this is not yet these case  \n18:00\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0then I can think of a few people who would like to have programming rights for \"virtual wiki\" only admins ....  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok it's a good idea, would be great if you could create a jira issue  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(camil7)  \n18:03\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, ok, taking a note to do so tomorrow  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just sent a mail about the 5.2 roadmap on the devs list if you have stuff you guys want to work on during 5.2 and want to make that visible ;)  \n18:06\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0just managed to scrap my local dev instance - I guess this wants to tell me to stop for today \u00a0;)  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n18:23\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:31\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0a quick question: is there any way to retain the CREATION date of a page after an import ?
