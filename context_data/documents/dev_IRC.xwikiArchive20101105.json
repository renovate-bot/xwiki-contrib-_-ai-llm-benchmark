because it looks rather ugly...  \ncjdelisle - (09:48): I don't know but I do know that html tables are strange and you might find the correct css foo on a blog if you google hard enough.  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:49  \nStulle - (09:49): hmmm, not a bad idea, indeed.  \nStulle - (09:50): do you know id sdumitru is coming in today?  \nStulle - (09:50): he seemed to be on good terms with the whole css stuff  \ncjdelisle - (09:51): I think he'll be here.  \nStulle - (09:51): okay, thanks  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 09:54  \nStulle - (09:56): speaking of him :-D  \nsdumitriu - (09:56): Me?

 \nsdumitriu - (09:57): Denis: Ping  \nStulle - (09:57): they got some additional spacing on top and bottom  \nStulle - (09:57): which looks rather shitty  \nDenis - (09:57): sdumitriu: \u00a0Hello  \nStulle - (09:57): i am trying to figure out how to remove that spacing.  \nStulle - (09:57): note the spacing is only applied if i use the ((( ))) group syntax to make cells with manual breaks  \nsdumitriu - (09:57): Hi Denis, I wanted to ask you if you're planning on releasing 2.2.7  \nStulle - (09:58): any ideas or hints?  \nsdumitriu - (09:58): Stulle: Those are the margins for a paragraph  \nDenis - (09:58): sdumitriu: No, never, doesn't Thomas already remove it from JIRA ?  \nsdumitriu - (09:58): Denis: No  \nsdumitriu - (09:58): I'll do it now, OK?  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 09:58  \nDenis - (09:58): sdumitriu: he ask me however, yes you can  \nStulle - (09:59): ah, i see. so any way of removing that for tables? or add it for all cells all together?  \nsdumitriu - (10:00): Can you give the syntax you used?  \nStulle - (10:00): |cell1|cell2|(((  \nStulle - (10:00): cell3-1  \nStulle - (10:00): cell3-2  \nStulle - (10:00): )))  \nStulle - (10:00): and so forth for the other lines, if they have multiple lines  \nsdumitriu - (10:01): K, thanks  \nStulle - (10:01): and you are of course right, there is in fact a <p> </p> statement in the html... didn't think this would be the cause. incidentally it's only there for multi line cells  \nsdumitriu - (10:03): Stulle: You can add this to CSS:  \nsdumitriu - (10:03): table p { margin: 0; }  \nStulle - (10:03): will try, thanks a bunch!  \nStulle - (10:04): whoa, you're awesome! :-D  \nsdumitriu - (10:07): I'm not sure if this should make it into the default skin  \nsdumitriu - (10:07): evalica: WDYT?  \nStulle - (10:08): imo yes... it gives consistency in the layout  \nevalica - (10:08): ... that p is autogenerated with?  \nStulle - (10:08): no matter how many lines a cell has  \nevalica - (10:09): Stulle are you sure you couldn't just remove the p, by taking extra spaces in the table?  \nevalica - (10:09): taking off = remove  \nStulle - (10:10): what do you mean by extra spaces?  \nStulle - (10:10): like the line breaks after ((( and before )))?  \nevalica - (10:11): I think maybe .. there is a ....|(space)S@ndy...|  \nStulle - (10:11): no there is not  \nStulle - (10:11): no leading spaces for any of the lines  \nsdumitriu - (10:11): We could do something like: table p:first-child { margin-top: 0;} table p:last-child { margin-bottom: 0; }  \nsdumitriu - (10:12): evalica: I tried without any whitespaces, it's the same  \nsdumitriu - (10:12): It could be a bug in the rendering engine  \nsdumitriu - (10:12): Perhaps it considers that a table cell is a block level container  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 10:12  \nStulle - (10:13): sdumitriu: your suggestion would only remove the margins at the bottom or the top, am i understanding you right there?

 \nvmassol - (10:14): sdumitriu: I'll send an internal mail first about it to you to see what you think  \nStulle - (10:14): well, it'd still work for me, we use IE7 and above here :)  \nevalica - (10:15): sdumitriu: I can't replicate that p - I only get <br/> ... and I think we should allow p in tables  \nevalica - (10:16): sdumitriu: I think that space is because of <span class=\"wikiexternallink\"><a href  \ncjdelisle - (10:18): all of the XE distribution tests are still <version>2.6-SNAPSHOT</version>, am I ok to change them to 2.7-SNAPSHOT?

AFTER A MONTH!  \ncjdelisle - (11:06): connecting to smtp isn't that hard, if the server won't talk to you, you can use an external server where you have an account.  \ncjdelisle - (11:06): wireshark > \\*  \nStulle - (11:06): yeah but there is a smtp server in the network and the smtp group told me the problem is somewhere on the way  \nStulle - (11:07): but it's not my firewall, i confirmed it  \nStulle - (11:07): anyway, regarding the IE7 problem i was talking about earlier  \nStulle - (11:07): stackoverflow suggests using a java script to fix the inherit trouble on IE7  \nfm - (11:08): does anyone know where named queries are defined?
