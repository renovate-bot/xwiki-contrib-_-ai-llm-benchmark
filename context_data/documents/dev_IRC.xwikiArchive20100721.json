Now just debugging because it isn't producing the same output as the reference implementation.  \nabusenius - (14:31): great  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:32): There was no salsa8 implementation, so I needed that. There was no PBKCS2-SHA256 implementation so I needed that too.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:35): The reference implementation encrypts files and is indeed written for the truly paranoid. It takes 200MB 5 seconds to hash a password. Fortunately the time/space parameters are configurable.  \njvelociter - (14:35): hello all  \nlucaa - (14:35): hello jvelociter  \njvelociter - (14:36): xwiki.url.protocol in xwiki.cfg is still supported ?  \njvelociter - (14:36): (thinking about all the URL factories refactoring done more or less recently by thomas and others)  \nlucaa left at 15:18 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nflorinciu1 joined #xwiki at 15:59  \nevalica1 joined #xwiki at 15:59  \nEnygma` left at 16:01 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nsilviar1 joined #xwiki at 16:02  \nflorinciu left at 16:02 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nevalica left at 16:02 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nsilviar left at 16:02 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:09  \nlpereira left at 17:13 (Quit: Leaving.  \nevalica1 left #xwiki at 17:16  \nsilviar1 left at 17:30 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsdumitriu - (18:20): I can't believe how long it takes to make a release  \nKermitTheFragger left at 18:27 (Quit: Leaving  \nfmancinelli left at 18:28 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \njvdrean - (18:35): it is very long indeed  \nabusenius left at 18:37 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nbblfish1 joined #xwiki at 18:55  \nbblfish1 - (18:56): hello  \nbblfish1 - (18:56): I have a number of interfaces with @ComponentRole annotations  \nbblfish1 - (18:57): I would like to extract some of that code to reuse in other projects, but not have it depend on xwiki  \nbblfish1 - (18:57): any ideas on how to do that, without just having two copies of the code?  \nbblfish1 - (18:57): Or is this something one can do in Scala  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 19:01  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:04): bblfish1: Hi. I think you can just use the same code other places and the annotations will be ignored.  \nbblfish1 - (19:04): well I still have to import the annotations  \nlucaa - (19:04): bblfish1: one idea is to build the code independent and then wrap it with @componentRole interfaces for xwiki  \nbblfish1 - (19:05): yes, that's where I was thinking Scala could perhaps come in really handy  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:05): I see. We have been working on cert creation re foafssl. http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/contrib/sandbox/xwiki-crypto/src/main/java/org/xwiki/crypto/x509/  \nbblfish1 - (19:05): but not sure if it is possible at all  \nbblfish1 - (19:05): in Scala  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:06): I got signText to work as long as the user imports a CA cert when they sign up.  \nlucaa - (19:07): ( bblfish1: I would \u00a0need to google for Scala a bit... )  \nbblfish1 - (19:07): don't worry. I'll ask on #scala  \nflorinciu1 left at 19:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbblfish1 - (19:12): nice CalebJamesDeLisl on X509  \nbblfish1 - (19:12): what are you working on there?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:13): I wrote the x509 key maker. (it's derived from yours) I also wrote signText and pkcs12 storage for server side certs.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:14): I wrote another part for password based encryption. Right now I'm trying to implement a password based key derivation function.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:14): The only implementation is in C. fun fun fun.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:15): This KDF is really cool because you can tune how much cpu and how much memory it should take to hash a password.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:16): The default implementation uses like 200MB and 5 seconds to hash one password. It makes brute force not so attractive.  \nbblfish1 - (19:16): ah ok. Do you really need to be that efficient? Are you preparing for 10 thousand people to sign up to xwiki a second ?  \nbblfish1 - (19:16): oh!  \nsburjan left at 19:16 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nlucaa left at 19:16 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:17): I'm thinking maybe 1MB and 100ms is fine.  \nbblfish1 - (19:17): 200MB for one password?  \nbblfish1 is now known as bblfish ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:17): Yup. Imagine trying to run a password guesser on that function.  \nbblfish - (19:18): heh, but even better is not to have a password at all  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:18): I definitely agree.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:19): Of course RSA depends entirely on there being no efficient way to take a number to the 65537th root.  \nbblfish - (19:20): you can change the exponent  \nbblfish - (19:20): can be anything  \nbblfish - (19:21): for some reason most implementations use that number  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:21): Oh. Snother thing is since I am doing PKCS#7 for signText compatibility, we have added to the interface encryptText so the user can encrypt text and send it as an email to the mail client with the private key.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:22): AKA send bank information (encrypted in database) to billing department.  \nbblfish - (19:22): ah ok. But why not create a seperate framework for that? I mean why put it as part of the key generation piece  \nbblfish - (19:23): then we can share code I mean\u2026  \nbblfish - (19:23): btw, we did an implementation of foaf+ssl for Clerezza in Scala last month  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:23): It is Seperate from the keymaker. It is in the X509 section which I'm thinking of renaming CMS since it's so PKCS7 oriented.  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 19:23  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:24): Hmm. I seem to be capitalizing all of my s's  \nbblfish - (19:24): ah ok. Cool  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:24): The certs \\_should\\_ still be foafssl compatible.  \nbblfish - (19:24): btw, one interesting thing about the clerezza code is that we placed the code inside the SSL library  \nbblfish - (19:25): well it is very easy to make the certs foaf+ssl compatible :-)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:26): One goal in my mind is to allow permissions to be granted between wikis.  \nbblfish - (19:26): well that is the whole point of foaf+ssl  \nbblfish - (19:26): you should aim higher, permissions between any site  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:27): I think one of the limitations of foafssl will be that many site opperators don't want to interopperate, they want to be king of their kingdom.  \nbblfish - (19:28): let us start working together. Then the network effect takes over  \nbblfish - (19:28): at a certain size those who are outside loose out, and become insiders  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:29): I think the right approach is to make it easy to run a site on multiple computers in a \"loose cluster\" and make it easy for people just starting a site to have traffic by joining. Then there will be some users.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:30): \\*by joining a group.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:31): I think the model to follow is fidonet. A bunch of small bbs's with no real content or user base could become a great network by joining forces.  \nbblfish - (19:31): I am in Fontainbleau again, btw, so we could meet to let you know how you can do that with WebID  \nbblfish - (19:31): the thing is to do that using web architecture  \nbblfish - (19:31): anyway here is the scala code http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/clerezza/trunk/org.apache.clerezza.parent/org.apache.clerezza.platform.security.foafssl/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/clerezza/foafssl/ssl/X509TrustManagerWrapperService.scala  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:32): Mmm linq queries I like.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:33): \"meet\" I'm on the east coast of the USA :)  \nbblfish - (19:33): ah ok  \nbblfish - (19:33): forgot  \nbblfish - (19:34): well, once someone auths into xwiki with foaf+ssl - you could use the above code- then you can crete groups of WebIDs  \nbblfish - (19:34): very easy  \nbblfish - (19:34): nd since they are global, two xwiki users \u00a0from different xwikis can access a resource  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:34): I think the real target audience is not the established sited but the newcomers who need to unite to get a foothold in the web.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:36): The big problem is trust. Who do you trust? do you trust who they trust? What happens when somebody starts spamming? Every decentralized network has the risk of becoming usenet.  \nbblfish - (19:37): that is the next level of problem  \nbblfish - (19:37): but you do it on a case by case basis  \nbblfish - (19:37): it's completley open  \nbblfish - (19:38): if you own a resource, you decide who to trust, or what rules for trust  \nbblfish - (19:38): so if you have a blog, it can be friends of friends  \nbblfish - (19:38): if you are a company: colleagues of colleagues  \nbblfish - (19:38): whatever  \nbblfish - (19:38): you work that out through relations in the linked data network  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:39): I really like also the possibility for a number of sites to unite for strength (think wikileaks) They have a group of sites which periodically mirror one another and that seems like a perfect use case.  \nvmassol left at 19:45 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:52): Side note: Never ever rely on PKCS#12 password protection. It is far worse than it's predecessor PKCS#5.  \nfmancinelli left at 20:05 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nmflorea left at 20:08 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 20:21  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 20:21  \nfmancinelli left at 20:30 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nlpereira joined #xwiki at 21:37  \nlpereira left at 21:41 (Client Quit  \nbblfish1 joined #xwiki at 21:42  \nbblfish left at 21:45 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nlucaa left at 22:38 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \njvdrean left at 23:55 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 23:55  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 23:55  \njvdrean left at 23:56 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \n\n"}
