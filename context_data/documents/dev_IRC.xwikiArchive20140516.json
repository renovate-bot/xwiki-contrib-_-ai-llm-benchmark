 \n11:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh re our previous discussion about svn vs. git, I have noticed that my contributors gravitate toward the svn model  \n11:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so I have this huge dir called contrib and most pull reqs go there  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: I've documented the steps to create a jira project  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: let me know when you've finished the jira project creation so that I can check if my instructions were good enough :)  \n11:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh I'm basically clicking in random places which have similar words to what you wrote  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you don't know what you're doing maybe you shouldn't be doing it\u2026 why are you a jira admin in this case? that seems dangerous to me if you're clicking at random...  \n11:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0``Make sure that the default assignee is \"Unassigned\" and that it's not the Project Lead by default'' <-- this is default so it should be good  \n11:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0err that is to say, you should be able to remove this line  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've fixed about 15 projects that were wreong yesterday  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so don't underestimate people's power to change things ;)  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I say 15, I really mean 15  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0possibly 17  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this was leading to lots of issues that are wrongly assigned to people that are never going to fix them  \n11:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, jira is an incredible tool for keeping people employed :D  \n11:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok I think I'm finished  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not correect :(  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/NODEXMODEL/workflows  \n11:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0can't believe it's not possible to create a single push-button to do all of that  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0check my doc I put a note about that  \n11:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0right, I'm quite sure I clicked on XWiki Workflow Scheme  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could also write a script that will do all that after the project is created  \n11:18\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n11:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0just did now  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is wrong too: http://jira.xwiki.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/NODEXMODEL/fields  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this too: http://jira.xwiki.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/NODEXMODEL/versions  \n11:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh yeah, if I go into my history and figure out when I pushed out versions, I'll \u00a0be busy all day  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no much point in having ajira project  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you don't set any version  \n11:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well it's a nice place to say when something is broken  \n11:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and if I do releases in the future I'll create a version for them  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at the very least you need to have the version you're going to release next  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you won't be able to assign if you have no version  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(assign to a release)  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nor report properly  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I were to create a jira issue today  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0=i wouldn't be abler to do so  \n11:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0just added 0.6  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I woudn't be able to tell against which version to report  \n11:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh right, I should also put 0.5 since that's what's in the master branch  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless you consider there's been no version released  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in which case it's not bugs but new features ;)  \n11:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm... trying to think about why none of this was ever necessary w/ github issues  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the same with ggithub  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly the same  \n11:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nope  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and jira is not forcing you to use versions  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works without  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's our best practices  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want to do shitty work you don't need much  \n11:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I guess in github people report against versions by using tags  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or work alone  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can indicate milestones in github too  \n11:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't work alone :)  \n11:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I just second-guess everything  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see https://github.com/tcurdt/jdeb/issues/milestones  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know how github issues works cjd. I told you have versions too  \n11:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0my workflow for my project is when something is merged to master, that's effectively a release  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: if you want to change things, propose them on the list, not just to me, I don't have any power. They need to be discussed/agreed by all committers  \n11:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I can just tell you is how things are done so far  \n11:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I just want to understand the costs/benefits first  \n11:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0note that I'm not really complaining as much as I am drilling for unformation  \n11:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*information  \n11:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if I see an obvious benefit to a different model, then I will be able to make a coherent proposal  \n11:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0<musing> jira is lacking proper source integration because I should be able to copy a jira.conf file into my repo and have the jira issue manager created automatically  \n11:34\u00a0<PappingPeter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:34\u00a0<PappingPeter>\u00a0Hi there!
