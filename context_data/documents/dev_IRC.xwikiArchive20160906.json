 \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: almost but not fully yet  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we started working on one but it's not 100% ready yet but you could try it  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's available here:  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/docker-xwiki  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've put the latets version on a branch actually  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: here: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/docker-xwiki/tree/VERSION2  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note to self: continue the work\u2026 :)  \n10:03\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, thanks  \n10:04\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0indeed that could be very great to have a fully functional docker image in docker hub ;)  \n10:04\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I mean useful ;)  \n10:05\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0(until then there's always the zip package)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's better than that  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have the debian distirbution too  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationViaAPT)  \n10:08\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, yes, but what I like with zip/manual install \u00a0is you can install several instances on the same node easily ;)  \n10:08\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0but for one-time testing the debian packaging is great indeed  \n10:11\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0(vmassol, unless I miss a power step that allow multiple instances with debian packaging :D)  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: maybe, I don't know, I've never used it :)  \n10:11\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0lol  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the zip distribution is not for production  \n10:11\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0yes, of course  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just for testing  \n10:12\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, btw I like the new download page, very clear  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool :)  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks for the feedback  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica will be pleased!  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(she did the new design)  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: the debian packages like most debian packages is not designed to have several instances yes  \n10:13\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, that's it  \n10:15\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I have no idea how it could be feasible with debian packages but sure thing : it would be so cool for production env...  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in prod environment, I doubt you want to run several wikis side by side, do you?  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(usually you'd use containers / vms to isolate them)  \n10:17\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0well I run several tomcat instances as different users  \n10:17\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n10:18\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:19\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, but I agree it's not a top of the line practice...  \n10:21\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I may have to talk with Fabio about this...  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n10:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol, sice we forked the jodconverter repo https://github.com/xwiki/jodconverter I guess we should also create a jira repo for it so that we can log the issues we fix  \n10:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0WDYT?  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you want me to do it ?  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or are you doing it?)  \n10:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sure, go ahead, I guess it needs to be a top level module, XJODC, or JODC  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah but I don't like too much as a \u00a0top level  \n10:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't like it either but we forked it on xwiki repo not on contrib..  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep because it's used by the core  \n10:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0maybe we should move it to contrib  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then we would need to move the office import feature to contrib too  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we cannot have a core module use a contrib module  \n10:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, then I don't see any alternative to the top level module  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(s/cannot/shouldn't)  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: sure sure I'm just wondering if we shouldn't create a new category for tools or something  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n10:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0a new category sounds good, but I don't know what else we could \"move\" there  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xinfra  \n10:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Miscellaneous\" category? \"Others\"?  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we don't care and I just add it to teh top levels for now and we hope it's not going to confuse users  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway creating it for now  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, let's start with a top level module  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what are the versions released btw so that I create the versions in jira?  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's another option  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we create a component in the XWiki Platform jira project for it and we sync the version with platform  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a bit hacky though  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yet another option is to move the code to platform  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems better to keep it outside though, wdyt?  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm ready to create the new jira project, should I go ahead mflorea?  \n10:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@tmortagne any opinion?  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok creating in 30 seconds  \n10:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: reading  \n10:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0outside is better IMO  \n10:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0keep the code outside  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n10:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I wouldn  \n10:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so I wouldn't use a component in platform  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: can you find me the versions in the meantime?  \n11:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a03.0-beta-4-xwiki-20110822  \n11:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0+1 for outside and we could imagine an \"Externals\" category to follow http://maven.xwiki.org/externals/ naming  \n11:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed, an Externals category shoulds good  \n11:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sounds good  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sounds good even though there'd be only one ATM  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok doing it  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: found it: http://maven.xwiki.org/externals/org/artofsolving/jodconverter/jodconverter-core/  \n11:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there would be only one because I'm too lazy to have done proper git repository for a few things like pygments jar packaging :)  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on your machine ATM?  \n11:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but this one is not exactly an external since I publish it on Maven central anyway  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but we have other externals  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I agree anyway  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing it  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like jython or oauth  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@mflorea: done  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XJOD  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'lll let you create the new version  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since I don't know what it'll be)  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ANN: e.x.o now has a new home page :)  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: when you click on login under contrib you are then redirected to http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Carousel/Section1  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should change the text under \"All Extensions\" since it's not accurate anymore  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a pity the tag cloud is so big for no much tags in practice  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok fiing  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*fixing  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for the rest it looks good  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes login and register are wrong  \n11:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0hello, FYI tag cloud is like this https://snag.gy/xgPDd9.jpg for me (FF + debian)  \n11:26\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0most of tags are grey (quiet invisible)  \n11:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0Pbas: could you try to refresh the cache? since I haven't seen that ever  \n11:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0+ I did not changed anything on the tagcloud/livetable styling  \n11:27\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0already done!  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: you hilighted with your mouse right?  \n11:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yep  \n11:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0and grey tags are not hyper link  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:29\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0(I'm not login)  \n11:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ok - so that is on mouse highlight, not on view \u2026 so in this case not sure what the problem is or what you would have expected  \n11:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0register and login should be fixed now  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed there's a problem with the tags because we're filtienr the LT  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it displays all the tags for non recommended extensions too  \n11:32\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I just started VM machine with XP Pro + firefox 33: same things (but I use same proxy)  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is why you can't click on them  \n11:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm not sure what version to use for the forked JOD converter. I don't think we have a convention. I'm thinking of using the -xwiki suffix, e.g. 3.1-xwiki-SNAPSHOT, 3.1-xwiki. I'm wondering if EM may have issues with such a versioning scheme  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is something we should improve in this tag cloud  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie the tag cloud of hte LT)  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be an option  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: -xwiki is pretty much our de factor standard if not official  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what I always use  \n11:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, good  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no such thing as invalid version for EM  \n11:35\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Grey tags are not grey but white (very difficult to see) , no?  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it needs to be the right order though for upgrades  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: they're grey or you woudn't know they're there ;) but as I said that's not the problem  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that we should not show them in the recommended LT  \n11:35\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok np :)  \n11:36\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0we can not filtering none recommended extension then?  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: when it get 3.1-xwiki it will cut it in 3, 1, xwiki and compare each element one by one so 3.1-xwiki will be higher than 3.1 (because it does not now \"xwiki\", things likes \"SNAPSHOT\" or \"beta\" or something else it knows will produce the opposite: 3.1-SNAPSHOT is lower than 3.1) but lower then 3.2  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/now/know/  \n11:40\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0On the page http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ExtensionCode/RecommendedExtensions/RecommendedDefinition/ the link is \"You can also check the full list of all Extensions.\" but this link goto \"Recommended Extension\"  \n11:41\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok sorry (I found the link on my screen on the front of my eyes http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ExtensionCode/AllExtensions/)  \n11:43\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Anyway I resolve my jmx message \"There's already a JMX MBean instance type=CacheManager,name=\"xwiki\" already registered under 'org.xwiki.infinispan' JMX domain.
