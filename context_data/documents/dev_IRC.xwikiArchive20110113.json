 \n12:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The rule I have been going by thus far.  \n12:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's easier for me to just follow a protocol than to have to make a judgement call each time \"is this big enough to warrant an issue?\"  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a lot of work for not much that's all  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have more bureaucracy work than real production thing in this case  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then the release manager also has more work  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since he needs to sort out important things to put in the release notes (ie he needs to exclude stuff from them)  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but again it's ok, just don't expect others to do it too :)  \n12:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I can skip issues just as well, but I need to know when to skip and when to create them.  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we use to skip jira at least for: javadoc improvements, internal reafctoring, checkstyle fixes  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm sure there are more  \n12:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I can follow any rule you'd like, what I have a hard time with is guessing.  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again it's ok  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was just commenting on jira to help you avoid unnecessary work that's all  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in case you wanted to avoid it)  \n12:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Unnecessary work > unnecessary thinking & worrying if I got it right  \n12:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\"don't expect others to do it too\" A lot of things I'm rather strict about I do them so I give everyone else the benefit of assuming they are strict about how they do thngs too.  \n12:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*there was an \"the way\" which went in there somewhere.  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah we shouldn't be too strict  \n12:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That is to say, I'm strict with myself.  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our rules should either be unanimous or should allow liberty if there's no way to define them strictly  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally what I'm trying to do in general is balance  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the paperwork vs the benfits of them regarding prodcution of runtime code  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so minimal paperwork required to get the runtime code we need  \n12:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Stuff like using \"final\", often it has no real benefit other than making the compiler enforce that the code does what I intend it to do. I'd never ask other people to do that.  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re final I've always been ambivalent  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've read severzl things about it  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in places htey recommend using it  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in other they strictly say you shouldn't use it  \n12:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0^never heard that one.  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the compiler will do it by itself (AFAIR)  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they call it overoptimization  \n12:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I do it because it declares that I don't intend to change that variable. It is self documenting.  \n12:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Perfect exmple of the sort of thing I'd never ask someone else to do.  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's the good point\u2026 the bad point is what happens with the String class for ex and several other from the JDK that you cannot extend  \n12:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Oh I never ever declare a class final unless there is a compelling security reason.  \n12:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0^that I would complain about if I saw it ;)  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're talking only about final params?  \n12:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0final parameters, local variables and fields.  \n12:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You see one non final local variable in a mess of final ones, you ar alerted that it will be changed.  \n12:58\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0OTOH, final everything makes the jvm allow you to do horrible things with inner classes.  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well for me java should all be final  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw AFAIR final doesn't prevent a param from being modified  \n12:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if it's an object passed - only the ref is final)  \n12:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes, that is indeed a gotcha.  \n12:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0final != const  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case findbugs reports when code modified params  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as a major viomation  \n13:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Another gotcha is there's a bug in the sun jvm where final local primitives sometimes are reset to 0.  \n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://nemo.sonarsource.org/plugins/resource/207147?page=org.sonar.plugins.core.hotspots.GwtHotspots is interesting  \n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow we have a unit test method that takes 5mn  \n13:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0javascript:;  \n13:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow 10 minutes in security unit tests  \n13:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0xwiki-crypto?  \n13:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n13:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0IIRC there was a bit of key generation there.

Nothing really changes in the crypto module.  \n13:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0As soon as this database I'm writing is done, I can put all my effort into a macro which allows the contentAuthor to change if the content inside of it is signed.  \n13:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what is that supposed to do?  \n13:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Basically, anything which has no signature runs with almost no permissions.  \n13:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So if I have programming permission, I can write script anywhere from a comment to a document to an object.  \n13:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0All I have to do is sign it.  \n13:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0And if I don't want to give it that power, I just don't sign.  \n13:24\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so you mean you want to create a macro which would grant a document a certain set of rights regardless of who the last author of the page is? am i getting what you are saying?  \n13:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Only what is inside of the macro.  \n13:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, still sounds like a neat idea. however, what i wonder about, wouldn't that allow users to make use of other users permissions? or will it be validated upon saving for the first time?  \n13:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So I can be like: {{signed}} {{groovy}} println('hello world'); {{/groovy}} {{signature}}WFHfahsDDhfFdktuTaEgfFasFsfh.....{{/signed}}  \n13:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i imagine it this will require rather extensive changes  \n13:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it can be patched in to the current system pretty easy, for best security we should make everythign ask the \"notary\" before doing anythign requiring permissions though.  \n13:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm  \n13:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0And every time that code is rendered, it will be validated. If it fails validation, it will not run.  \n13:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sounds like you love thinking about millions of possibilities when coding stuff ;)  \n13:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If anyone changes anything between {{signed}} and {{/signed}} the it won't run.  \n13:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But! you can just splice that snippet into any page, limiting that has to be enforced by the code inside of it.  \n13:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\"millions of possibilities\" :) \u00a0I like security when there is a small well reviewed well understood piece of code onwhich all security depends.  \n13:31\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sounds all pretty nice.  \n13:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah. i mean the idea is great but it will remain an \"advanced\" feature, imo  \n13:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0AKA every time you attack the system, you end up staring at that signature validating code.  \n13:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Like a bottle neck.  \n13:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mhmm  \n13:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0We can do \"one click signing\" easy enough.  \n13:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, the signing is also something to be considered in detail... i mean using private and public key won't very well work, i guess  \n13:34\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the crypto module actually supports validating signatures made by firefox with a key in the ff key store.  \n13:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so you're stuck with only a public key which needs to be validated upon initial save, i think  \n13:34\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0AKA you could root the server and you still wouldn't be able to sign stuff lol  \n13:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that may be but what about people using other browsers...  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's not very wiki in the spirit  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you sign something and nobody else can change it  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(needs to be resigned)  \n13:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0True enough, but for PR code, noone should be able to change it.  \n13:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, if it's code i don't think it's very objectionable because whoever should be able to change it should also have enough rights to sign himself  \n13:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0^that  \n13:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0What it means to the world though is I can introduce a groovy script which presents an api and anyone can paste that script into myxwiki.org and use the api which I presented.  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0question: do we need a jira issue when we remove deprecated method? \u2026 hmmm\u2026. I'm tempted towards no  \n13:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe you're call ;)  \n13:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*your  \n13:37\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i can definately think this is a nice addition for coders, like running shell commands via XWiki, but from a customer POV i only see an advantage when somebody is adding code to a page which needs to be changed by the less privelged customer...  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(provided it respects the rule for removing deprecated methods of course)  \n13:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0needs to be changed content wise, that is  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: seen my mail about it?  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(waiting for some replies)  \n13:40\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0also, what should be taken into consideration regarding the whole sign macro would be that there could be a need for nesting... like i want to write something dynamically and the crucial part has to be signed and if it's not we do nothing or show a warning  \n13:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I see. We're sort of in quicksand with the public api. Nothing we can really do there.  \n13:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hence my reservedness at adding anything new.  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: it doesn't change anything  \n13:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0jstoldt: You mean to say that you want to have something which requires an admin's privilege signed by an admin and inside of that inclide a bit which requires a programmer?  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0having to drop 500 methods or 600 doesn't change  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll drop them all at once  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by offering a migration path  \n13:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cjdelisle: yeah, something like that.  \n13:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0haha Interesting, I'm talking about signed macro, you're talking about old api.  \n13:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i wouldn't know ;)  \n13:43\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n13:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Brilliant! We can make the old api into groovy and sign it then anyone can pull it in to the code which needs it.  \n13:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but yeah, the basic idea is that if you want to cover everything there might be a need for some nesting for all i can see  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: 1378 deprecated calls used in xwiki: http://nemo.sonarsource.org/drilldown/violations/207147?rids%5B%5D=215556&rule=squid%3ACallToDeprecatedMethod#  \n13:43\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:44\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n13:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yup, nesting dignatures will be supported although nesting script macros is not and should not be.  \n13:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*signatures  \n13:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0by old api you mean some old, deprecated api and you suggest a way to be able to remove it while still being able to use it if needed, right?  \n13:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes! :D  \n13:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm okay, i feel dumber by the second but apparently i help you finding ideas! yay! ;)  \n13:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I have thought it would be cool to have a web server which would execute \\_anything\\_ you posted to it.  \n13:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0As long as it had a valid signature.  \n13:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0~1000 lines of code for the server.

Still, with special title param,  \n19:45\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0As for the flag to skip title, Jerome also asked for it, I will add it as soon as I have the time to work on that (along with translations refactoring, probably).  \n19:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k, we still need to find some time to work together on gadgets/dashboard  \n19:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Im open whenever you want)  \n19:46\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: yes, I agree, we need to talk  \n19:51\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0sdumitriu: I tried out 2.7 - but now I have another error:  \n19:51\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0internal.DefaultVelocityEngine \u00a0- Left side ($events.size()) of '>' operation has null value at unknown namespace[line] 658, column 21]  \n19:51\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0The Activity has no output :-(  \n19:54\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0See http://www.pfarreiengemeinschaft-westum-loehndorf.de/xwiki2/bin/view/Main/Dashboard  \n19:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0dirk\\_schmitt: You should change the Admin password  \n20:11\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:23\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:34\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:40\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0!help  \n21:48\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0!who - shows who is on the other channel  \n21:48\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0!who - shows who is on the other channel  \n21:48\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0!shutdown - shutdown bridge (will probably attempt to rejoin after a few seconds)  \n21:48\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0!shutdown - shutdown bridge (will probably attempt to rejoin after a few seconds)  \n21:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0!who  \n21:48\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0\\* members: CalebJamesDeLisle, Eduard Moraru, James Thompson, Ricardo Rodriguez  \n21:48\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0\\* members: CalebJamesDeLisle, Eduard Moraru, James Thompson, Ricardo Rodriguez  \n21:52\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has quit  \n21:53\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0!who  \n22:28\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0\\* members: CalebJamesDeLisle, [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), Eduard Moraru, James Thompson, Ricardo Rodriguez  \n22:28\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0\\* members: CalebJamesDeLisle, [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), Eduard Moraru, James Thompson, Ricardo Rodriguez  \n22:29\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has quit  \n22:29\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:29\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0!who  \n22:29\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0\\* members: CalebJamesDeLisle, dirk, Eduard Moraru, James Thompson, Ricardo Rodriguez  \n22:29\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0\\* members: CalebJamesDeLisle, dirk, Eduard Moraru, James Thompson, Ricardo Rodriguez  \n22:37\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0!who  \n22:37\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0\\* members: CalebJamesDeLisle, Eduard Moraru, H.-Dirk Schmitt, James Thompson, Ricardo Rodriguez  \n22:37\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0\\* members: CalebJamesDeLisle, Eduard Moraru, H.-Dirk Schmitt, James Thompson, Ricardo Rodriguez  \n22:48\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has quit  \n22:48\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:50\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has quit  \n23:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:29\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:53\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
