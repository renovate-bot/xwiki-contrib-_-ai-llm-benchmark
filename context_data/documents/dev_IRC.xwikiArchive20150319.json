A quick question: if I have a page with multiple Xwiki.stylesheetExtension object. From another page, can I call only one SSX object with $xwiki.ssx.use(\"MySpace.MyDocWithSSXObjects\", xxxxxx)?  \n10:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n10:43\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n10:43\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0come back marius! :)  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: I'm not sure. But are you sure that not all SSX or JSX are pulled if you have more than one?  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you can try it)  \n10:52\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0Pbas: not as far as I know it will put all the objects, Except if something has changed on ssx since versions 4.something  \n10:52\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0But maybe you need/can reorganize a bit your ssx objects :D  \n10:53\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Yes but goal is to call only a piece of CSS instruction and avoid multiple page with a tiny bit of CSS instruction  \n10:56\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I tried: $xwiki.ssx.use(\"MySpace.MyDocWithSSXObjects call ALL SSX object attached in the page  \n10:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne, vmassol: I've asked msmeria to re-test XWIKI-11892 with the latest snapshot (since I have some troubles with oracle's configuration): he still reproduces the issue  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:(  \n10:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so my recent change about xwiki-enterprise-ui-mainwikipreferences does not fix this  \n10:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Then I must add some page+SSX object (a little bit messy)... Thxs.  \n11:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Pbas: I confirm, this behaviour haven't changed  \n11:01\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Ok thanks you  \n11:02\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0Pbas: really depends on what is the structure of your pages & CSS, but usually I find it not such a bad idea to have multiple CSS, one for each screen of my application, and group the CSS directives by their \"scope\". This way I can also delete it easier, because I know what it is for, and if the screen is not used anymore, I can delete its CSS as well (otherwise in general it's not very easy to delete the CSS if it's all in one page / file)  \n11:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0Pbas: I mean, if you have multiple objects because every object is for one scope, you might as well have multiple pages  \n11:07\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0My purpose is to avoid JS. \u00a0In velocity: if $mandatoryField => use SSX MySpace.ShowRedField Else use SSX MySpace.ShowNormalField  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: it probably means we fail to save part of what makes Admin user have admin right (it has to be something specific to Oracle so except saving...)  \n11:10\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0It would be more tidy up with something like \u00a0use SSX MySpace.ShowField.ObjectssxRed and SSX MySpace.ShowField.ObjectssxNormal. But it deosn't matter  \n11:10\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0\\*doesn't  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: it would probably help if you go trough to the DW so that he log get saved in the status and we can look at it, see if there is any error in it  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/he log/the log/  \n11:12\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n11:13\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:17\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, I'll attach it to the issue after retesting  \n11:23\u00a0<martin-h>\u00a0has quit  \n11:31\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: check my comment for XWIKI-11892  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: sorry I forgot to mention it's not the DW status we need but the installed extension status  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the extension install log is stored in the extension status itself, so XE UI main wiki status  \n11:36\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm not sure I follow :) where can I find this file ?  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: you attached the DW status but the DW use extension manager to install and extension and we need this extension status  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0somewhere in status/extension/action/  \n11:37\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0hi there! i am having trouble accessing password values from form fiels: customObject.getProperty(\"hpqcUserPass\").value  \n11:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/ install and extension / install an extension /  \n11:38\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0can someone please help me out?

 \n11:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0.value call getValue() yes but unless you have programming right you won't get the password  \n11:49\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0got it, @programming right: for the scipr tor user rendering the page?  \n11:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I've attached the status you requested  \n11:49\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0because i am running it with the admin user  \n11:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0one thin I noticed in the jetty log: 2015-03-19 12:41:36,501 [main] WARN \u00a0.e.r.i.l.LocalExtensionStorage - Failed to load extension from file [data\\extension\\repository\\org%2Exwiki%2Eenterprise%3Axwiki-enterprise-ui-admin-user\\7%2E0-SNAPSHOT\\org%2Exwiki%2Eenterprise%3Axwiki-enterprise-ui-admin-user-7%2E0-SNAPSHOT.xed] in local repository \u00a0org.xwiki.extension.InvalidExtensionException: Failed to parse descriptor  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: did you had a conflict ?

 \n11:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vfzevaze: I tough you were getting nothing  \n11:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you won't get better that the hash  \n11:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the password are not stored in clear  \n11:58\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0alright  \n11:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(would be a major security issue)  \n11:59\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0is there an api or utils in xwiki to get the true value?  \n11:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you need password for ? maybe there is another way to do what you need  \n12:00\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0ok, i am giving the user the possibility to set it's credentials in the admin section of xwiki  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vfzevaze: when you create a password field  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can decide how it's stored  \n12:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this hash is supposed to be only one way (when safe enough) so no the idea is that nobody should be getting the password from the hash  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can store in plain text if you want  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example you'll need to do this if you need to pass it to some external server to connect to it  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but then anyone who can this this document can also see the password  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vfzevaze: users can change their passwords in their profile page :)  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you don't need the password in clear for that  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you ask for the old password, you hash it then compare to the hash value in DB and change it  \n12:02\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0wait a sec  \n12:02\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0those creds are for a macro  \n12:03\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0the user will set credentials for the macro to be able to auth itself in a ticketsystem  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you need to do as I said  \n12:03\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0the hash i do understand, thought there is somehow via programming rights an util with the correct salt avaiable  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in your xclass set the password xproperty to store in clear  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: this will make any user able to see any other user credentials  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: this is what we do for lots of things :)  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0including mail sending  \n12:04\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0the hash or plain text?  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would not say \"lots of things\" and mail sending is one admin password, it's not something the user thing is a personal information...  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/thing/think/  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: and no you won't see the password in clear  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's still hidden  \n12:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's hidden in the UI  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in the object editor and in view mode)  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the object editor too  \n12:23\u00a0<martin-h>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:25\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n12:39\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0thx for the help guys!  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vfzevaze: works?
