If I have a Headline which have \"space\" between the names I didn't get the anchor to work. For example I want to link to the headline \"1.2.3 Sub Headline\" I would use the link [[Subheadline Label>>doc:Space.PageName||anchor=\"H1\\.2\\.3 Sub Headline\"]]  \n14:26\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0What syntax are you using, 2.1?  \n14:30\u00a0<maxr\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0GuillaumeF: no that's not correct  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0that's 2.0  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0for 2.1 it's: ||anchor=\"HSubHeadline\"  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0Kaisen: regarding the anchor you can check the genertaed html  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(view source in your browser)  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(we remove all spaces and special chars)  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0Denis: hi  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0Denis: when you have some time maybe you could have a look at XWIKI-9826 to verify if it's not a regression that arose with the new rights module  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9826  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0bad bot!  \n14:36\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:43\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Witch ||anchor=\"HSubHeadline I didn't get it working but with #HSubHeadline  \n14:47\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:48\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Forget it, it is related to the wiki syntax.
