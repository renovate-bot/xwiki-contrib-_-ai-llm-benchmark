if i use DBStringListProperty, hibernate is complaining it doesn't know value param (in xwiki.hbm.xml there are only three params -> id, name and list)  \n10:05\u00a0<sbaloul\\_>\u00a0is now known as <sbaloul>  \n10:13\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0greetings :)  \n10:18\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0solved, DBListClass is actually StringProperty  \n10:24\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0I am struggling to get the maven packager plugin running to automatically load my xml files into the db :/  \n10:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: you mean your xar files ?  \n10:26\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0The xar import via REST is working - but it takes some time :)  \n10:26\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Therefore I stumbled upen the maven packager plugin  \n10:26\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0xwiki-packager-plugin  \n10:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they use pretty much use the same code behind the scene I think  \n10:27\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: I got the maven tasks running, but it doesn't seem to do anything  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which goal did you use ?  \n10:27\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0I tried export and import  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0export is not going to help here :)  \n10:28\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0I thought so \u2026 but after import did not work you always get creative ^^  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you get in the log with import ?  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and what's your pom.xml  \n10:29\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0the log just says BUILD SUCCESS  \n10:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also you should look at https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/tree/master/xwiki-enterprise-data which is using import goal  \n10:30\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/3Vhx2FA1  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt it will work without the hibernate configuration (its commented in your pom.xml)  \n10:32\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0I tried it first without the commented - and he was looking for src/main/packager/hibernate.cfg.xml  \n10:32\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0so i just moved the file there  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha maybe indeed  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you want to import XAR that you previously deployed in a maven repository ?  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or is it just some XML you have in your project ?  \n10:33\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Not really, I want to edit the xml files directly within IntelliJ and push them into the db of a running instance  \n10:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by default what import goal does is to import all XAR you have as dependencies  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to import XML you have in your sources you need to indicate here they are with sourceDirectory  \n10:35\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0since it is a little uncomfortable to change things in the browser and always do a xar export -> extract -> put into project -> commit ^^  \n10:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: you could use http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/GitHubApp  \n10:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(commit documents from the wiki)  \n10:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is also http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/SVN+Application  \n10:37\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: doesn't it take a lot of time for a commit to get pushed into the wiki?  \n10:38\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: atm I am running two open browser windows and just do a save + refresh  \n10:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/GitHubApp handle git -> wiki, only wiki -> git  \n10:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*don't  \n10:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or I did not understand your question  \n10:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was suggesting you to directly modify and commit from the wiki instead or going through the fs  \n10:40\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0I thought so :)  \n10:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but if you also need to update the wiki and things comming from git then indeed it's a different matter  \n10:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case what you are missing from import goal is probably sourceDirectory property  \n10:42\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: I'll give it a try :)  \n10:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I doubt you will get something much quicker than REST  \n10:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0REST is that slow ?  \n10:43\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0building the xar takes a few seconds, importing at takes another few seconds. So one roundtrip is between 9 to 15 secs  \n10:43\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0instead of pressing save and refresh ^^  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0few second to build the XAR sound a lot, is it a big XAR ?  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or you mean you build it using mvm package ?  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which indeed take the time maven take  \n10:45\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0\u00a0i do :)  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is a lot more than just create a XAR file  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did you tried  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0?  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0might speed up the generation  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since that's what actually do the generation  \n10:46\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0It is a little quicker - but still takes 4 secs  \n10:47\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Maybe I ll just take a look at the packager sources and create a little IntelliJ extension, which pushes the files automatically into the database  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you do such extension it might be safer to do it using REST (and a lt easier since it mean you just have to zip files and send them through HTTP)  \n10:51\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0you mean -> zip xml to xar -> post to rest?  \n10:51\u00a0<sofiane>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: if you already have the package.xml file yes, otherwise you also have to generate it  \n10:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is not very complex, you can get the code from XAR plugin or use https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-xar library  \n10:58\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:04\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Great :) - that will be my \"little fun project\" when I am done with our next sprint :)  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would be a great tool :)  \n11:06\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Full ACK :)  \n11:13\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n11:14\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: there's a config option in the url module for path-based and wik-based  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0StandardURLConfiguration  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0isPathBasedMultiWiki()  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: StandardURLConfiguration is internal it seems  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't expose anything yet in the standard impl  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we can use them ourselves  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we release everything together so we can update our code if it changes  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau needs to expose it for script  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0scripts  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to decide who owns this config: url or wiki module  \n11:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I wrote it there was no wiki module  \n11:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0we also need to add getAliasSuffix(), which would be a good setting  \n11:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki-platform-url-standard depends on xwiki-platform-wiki-api so we'd better say wiki module :)  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now hte config property is: url.standard.multiwiki.isPathBased  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so changing this would mean deprecating this config property and providing a legacy of legacy  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now url module provides a legacy impl for \"xwiki.virtual.usepath\"  \n11:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but there is still a lot of places where xwiki.virtual.usepath is used  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and they need to be updated as well  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at the very least we must not add more places  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0url module is still not used eveyrwhere guillaume  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0url parsing is implemented  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not url serialization  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that there are other properties that might be better in the iwki module such as: getWikiNotFoundBehavior  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually they are the only 2 properties that could go in the wiki module  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(isPathBasedMultiWiki() and getWikiNotFoundBehavior())  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should need to have this in a script I think  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*shjouldn'(t  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*shouldn't  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the URL should be computed in the url module  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should be transparent for your script  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK the knowledge of whether it's path-based or domain-based is only used for URL compuation ATM  \n11:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0well, I need to set what is the default alias of a new wiki  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n11:59\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0playground is not the same thing than playground.xwiki.org  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n12:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and a script service to know the alias suffix would be nice to propose a good computed alias in the wizard that the user can change  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you should send a proposal to move the 2 properties from the standard url module to the wiki module and handle legacy  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for 6.x  \n12:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes  \n12:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0now, what should I do for 5.4.4?  \n12:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because of XWIKI-10181  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be nice to fix the issue I had for the upgrade + the broken link when clicking continue  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it doesn't need to be nice from an architecture POV  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(architecture/design)  \n12:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0then I propose http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10185  \n12:19\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Is there a preferred javascript library for client side validation?

I see the correct format is noted in the UI, however I just have overseen it. Sorry for confusing, cheers Helge.  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea error reporting is not great right now  \n18:02\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: I now get an Error 3002 in 3 'cause some attachment could not be found. I did not test if the saved .xar is ok for import anyway or if this error causes torouble. Do you know?  \n18:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you got the error when ?  \n18:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0during the export ?  \n18:03\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: yes  \n18:04\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: or in the end. Honestly, I did not watch the process...  \n18:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0full stack trace would be nice, I guess wikistream does not like some inconsistency in your database or something like this  \n18:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking the code to see if it continue exporting is case like this  \n18:05\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: you mean status.xml again or what would you need?  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0statux.xml will be fine  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*status.xml  \n18:06\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, one minute  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0helge: is export finished ?  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the XAR file is a valid zip then it means it continued exporting  \n18:10\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: status.xml was sent  \n18:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Failed to get content of attachment [Attachment xwiki:[[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)]\"  \n18:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"The attachment could not be found in the filesystem attachment store.  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as far as I can see it does not continue exporting in this case  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I should probably make it just log an error and continue in this case with an empty attachment  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in the meantime what you can do is fix this attachment  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(i.e. fo to Macros.SavedListExporterApplication page and delete or update this attachment content with a new one)  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/fo/go/  \n18:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0created XWIKI-10188  \n18:19\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: the .xar has 1GB only what is definetly too small for the complete wiki instance.
