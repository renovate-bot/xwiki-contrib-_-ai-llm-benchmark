Don`t you have to remove the bundles from the bundlesCache as well? If the translation is not found in the cache, it will ask the context for bundles and try to load it, then it will fail again.  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: not sure what you mean the bundle is removed from \"bundlesCache\" cache  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the only thing #clear method does  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the bundle ask the factory to remove itself from the cache  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm but I forgot another thing  \n16:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: from what I understand, there are 2 things: bundlesContext (list of documents containing translations) and bundleCache (cached translations, a subset of bundlesContext used for performance reasons)  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0bundlesContext is regenerated at each request for except for the bundles at root level  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I need to make sure there is no component with the bundle anymore  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm doing it now  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha no forget that  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the component associated wiki are automatially cleaned  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so all should be ok  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: bundleContext is only true in the current context and the current context wiki is not the deleted wiki usually I don't think I need to force cleaning it  \n16:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can look at DefaultTranslationBundleContext for how the context is created  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's just here to speed up a bit the thing in a context, to avoid asking the component manager each time you search for a translation  \n16:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I just looked at DocumentTranslationBundleFactory and saw that it is a singleton that has only this.bundleContext.addBundle(bundle); calls, but no removals.  \n16:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and thought that might be a problem, but you know the code better than I do  \n16:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0trying your fix locally, just to make sure :)  \n16:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so I can move on with the release  \n16:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0are commits still blocked?  \n16:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: it adds itself in case there is call in the same thread  \n16:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: yes  \n16:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like you add a new document translation and you try to use it right after in some thread  \n16:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(ok it's not super common use case but it was easy to support)  \n16:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: did not start the release yet.

I said that it is failing at each page load == http thread.  \n18:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you have a stack trace ?  \n18:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would like to see what is calling it exactly  \n18:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0was trying right now to copy the entire stack trace but my console could be crashing :)  \n18:05\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: http://hastebin.com/yobitugavi.sm  \n18:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right after deleting the wiki, the solr thread seems to be complaining.

But I am not sure here.  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is very weird, I will have to debug what is happening at context creation  \n18:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you have stacktraces for both cases in that link  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: in the meantime WDYT about hidding the error for the release like it used to be hidden  \n18:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0scroll down or search for \"###\"  \n18:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so performance will still be impacted  \n18:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0just maybe not that much...  \n18:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no I don't think so  \n18:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's slow because it print tons of log  \n18:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the database will still be asked a log  \n18:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for those not existing bundles  \n18:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*a lot  \n18:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt the issue is new but it used to not be logged  \n18:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok then  \n18:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for hide them for RC1 as long as we can fix it for final  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now it's probably not a big issue to release tomorrow  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I will work a bit on it and see if I get somewhere in less than an our  \n18:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thank you, Thomas  \n18:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gtg now  \n18:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0have a nice evening  \n18:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:00\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:08\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:10\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:13\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:51\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:52\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:16\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n23:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:20\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
