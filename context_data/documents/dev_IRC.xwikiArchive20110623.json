 \n14:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0because some loop keep creating caches probably  \n14:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And lots of Lucene Index Updater threads as well  \n14:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Looks like there are consecutive groups of 4 eviction + 1 lucene threads  \n14:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0All doing nothing at all, just sleeping  \n14:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe something is initializing plugins several times  \n14:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, probably  \n14:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since tests change XWikiPreferences a lot  \n14:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep was thinking about this one  \n14:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Someone recently touched the plugin initialization code  \n14:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Who was it?  \n14:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I changed the way to receive the event about plugin field modification but not what we do when it happen  \n14:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Looks like some plugins behave correctly  \n14:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0For example the scheduler  \n14:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So it could be a bug in the plugins themselves  \n14:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since I'm working on Lucene anyway, I'll check what happens when the plugins are reinitialized  \n14:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm but lucene init did not changed recently AFAIK, I only worked on reindex method  \n14:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n14:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0will check if it is really called only when the field is changed  \n14:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since it not supposed to be called for any xwikipreference modification  \n14:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Could be an old bug  \n14:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In the thread dump I don't see any processing threads  \n14:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So the build could hang because the java process runs out of threads and it can't create new normal http processing threads  \n14:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think I remember something about the number 200 as being the default maximum threads in Tomcat by default  \n14:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0at least that was the maximum default or not in some other installation I looked at  \n14:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or are the @qtp threads the ones?  \n14:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like there is an issue with the ObjectProperty matching since the code is called for a modification of a field which have nothing to do with \"plugin\", fixing that  \n14:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0actually BaseProperty is not generating the right reference  \n14:31\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<asyd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:53\u00a0<jamesxu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:25\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0jvelociter: Any progress on the watchlist NPE?

it's not just lets use the more recent one and it should be ok ?  \n17:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think the activity page requires PR just so that the macro is enabled  \n17:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm not sure it uses protected APIs  \n17:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: that's not required for macros  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: if it's more recent than the one we use it should be ok but we need to check the performance.
