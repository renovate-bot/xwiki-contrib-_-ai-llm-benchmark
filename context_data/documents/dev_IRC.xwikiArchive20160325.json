Havig A.B.C.WebHome, is there any way to get A.WebPreferences, A.B.WebPreferences and A.B.C.WebPreferences? I would like then to check if the documents exist and if they contain any object. In other words could I get the list of spaces ?  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acotiuga: what's the use case?  \n15:26\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0The RatingConfig inheritance  \n15:26\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0at this moment there is a condition to get the RatingConfig object  \n15:26\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0#if($xwiki.exists($webPrefDoc) && $webPrefDoc.getObjectNumbers($configClass) > 0) \u00a0\u00a0#set($configObj = $webPrefDoc.getObject($configClass)) #else \u00a0\u00a0#set($configObj = $globalConfigDoc.getObject($configClass)) #end  \n15:27\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0for my example this checks only if A.B.C.WebPreferences have the object  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not very good to store stuff in webpreferences  \n15:28\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0hmm, now it's stored there  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the best practice is that each app should store it in its Config class  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me find the doc  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if I can find it ;))  \n15:28\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0XWiki.Ratings.xml  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm we're missing it in http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/ApplicationDevelopmentBestPractices  \n15:28\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0in XWiki.UIExtensionClass  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so basically apps should have some <app name>Config page  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to hold the configuration  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the app  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0e.g. MailConfig  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Annotationconfig, etc  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*AnnotationConfig  \n15:30\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0This would come in addition to my use case, as what I'm trying to achieve is to have some specific configuration for an application  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but tmortagne should know better for the ratings app since he was part of the design  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"as what I'm trying to achieve is to have some specific configuration for an application\" seems we're talking about the sam thing then  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why webpreferences?  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: this application was not done from scratch and I was not part of this part of rating application design :)  \n15:31\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I guess because rating app is bundled in xwiki  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still you're our expert now tmortagne :)  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acotiuga: \u00a0I don't see the relationship  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not mean I can tell you why webpreferences was chosen back then  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the past we were putting all our cofig in xwikiprefs and webprefs  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*config  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we stopped doing this a long time ago now  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(@acotiuga)  \n15:33\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0now the ratings configurations can be set at different levels http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Ratings+Application#HNewconfigurationsource  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think what I did in some app was to check if there's a config page in the local wiki and if not, fall back on a config page in the main wiki  \n15:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acotiuga: ok  \n15:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the only thing to change in the future is to have a RatingsConfig in the space  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the use case is still needed  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so back to your question  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to find if a doc exists at the current space lavel? that's easy  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*level  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you need to navigate you'll start from the current doc reference and go up the reference tree  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0getLastSpaceReference() and then getParent() till the EntityType becomes different from SPACE  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does that answer your question?  \n15:37\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Yes, but I was thinking that maybe there could be a way to ge something like an array... like [A, A.B, A.B.C] ...  \n15:39\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0\u00a0I guess it would be nice to be able to loop through the levels  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you in java?  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because otherwise the issue is probably that you're ,ot  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*not  \n15:41\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0ok, I'm not  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this looks like some code that should be in java  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to return the configuration  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: wdyt?  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes should probably be in RatingsScriptService  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0some getConfigurationProperty(String) API which take care of searching for the configuration property trough current entity hierarchy  \n15:45\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0the String parameter being the hierarchy A.B.C?  \n15:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I see, the property  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no the string being the property name  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0getConfigurationProperty would look at the context for the hirarchy  \n16:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0test current space, then its parent, etc.  \n16:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe add a getConfigurationProperty(String, EntityReference) but not sure we really have the need  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd return the config data to not have to find the config every time you ask for a property  \n16:27\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I searched more in the ratings module and I think something else should be done to solve my problem. The problem seems to be here: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/0f5b636ea0eb6e761bc613bd8bc8995bd200f2d9/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-ratings/xwiki-platform-ratings-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/ratings/internal/AbstractRatingsManager.java#L97  \n16:28\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0It should iterate all the spaces in the hierarchy before the fallback to the global configuration  \n16:29\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0My config doc is skipped because is A.WebPreferences and the rating service checks A.B.C.WebPreferences and if doesn't exists, it sets to global config  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0acotiuga: yes rating application was probably not updated after nested spaces introduction  \n16:32\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0So in order to follow the inheritance rule, I would need to get the lowest level configuration existing  \n16:49\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:37\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:16\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0hello. i have worked hands-on with chart.js before.
