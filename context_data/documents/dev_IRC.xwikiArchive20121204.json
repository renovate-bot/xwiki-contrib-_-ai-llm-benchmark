The wiki recovers after the OOM happens, but for 10 minutes while tries to import, it is completely dead. Should I report this ?  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: you can report it, there's no reason it should lock the wiki and I don't see why it does. We're using a servlet container which is multi hreaded  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should only lock 1 thread  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc it can make the wiki slow but we can't do anything about this  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe your machine is underpowered?  \n17:03\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0xwiki deployed in Tomcat with \u00a0-server -Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=192m  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not memory  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's CPU  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well OOM is about memory, right ?  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it's both  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I had missed the OOM part in your message  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nothing we can do about tht  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it just means your server has not enough memory  \n17:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/r6c0mFbt CPU specs  \n17:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok.

 \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well yes if you are not up to date :)  \n17:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0normaly to get distribution wizard you need:  \n17:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* no distribution or partial distribution status  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* invalid extensions or the UI associated to the current distribution not installed  \n17:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: yes, but this is advanced debugging and I don't know how to do it.  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: export with libreoffice  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and see how long it takes  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0easy!  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: you should have a log about distribution status at the beginning of the log  \n17:15\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Ok that might be it  \n17:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0export what ? the page containing the bad document is empty  \n17:15\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I have a NPE at startup regarding distribution status  \n17:15\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I'll look into that  \n17:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I wait 10 minutes to get an empty page  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: I fixed one recently reported by jvdrean  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what version are you working on ?  \n17:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a04.2  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0can't find the jira issue but I would bet for the default UI not indicated in your distribution/war pom.xml  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which used to produce a nullpointer  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you also have the id of your distribution in your manifest  \n17:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:28\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0tmortagne: OK thanks I'll check this out  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: not sure it's fixed actually, could you give me your stack trace ?
