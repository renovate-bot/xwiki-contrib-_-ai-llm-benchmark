I'm having a problem when migrating to any of the new releases (3.2 or 3.3-\\*), from XE 3.1. I get an exception on com.xpn.xwiki.doc.rcs.XWikiRCSNodeContent#component[docId,version1,version2], and a SQL error arises: \"ERROR o.h.u.JDBCExceptionReporter \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Bad value for type long : <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <xwikidoc> <web>Scheduler</web> \u00a0...\".
