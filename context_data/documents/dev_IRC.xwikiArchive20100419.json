(I know less than I should)  \nvmassol - (09:33): http://bit.ly/bdtt9K  \nvmassol - (09:33): the only major difference is that guice has no annotations for the binding part  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 09:33  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:34): I see, the bind.to( notation.  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 09:34  \nvmassol - (09:34): yes guice has java apis only for the binding part  \nvmassol - (09:35): this one too: http://www.slideshare.net/mcculls/dynamic-guice-applications-3657876  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:35): Where ever we go, I am excited about the security implications, it makes principle of least authority very easy.  \nvmassol - (09:35): I'm trying to understand it right now  \nvmassol - (09:35): (the dynamic guice app slides)  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 09:36  \nvmassol - (09:36): I've started the osgi poc this week end too  \nvmassol - (09:36): (ie osgi beneath our programming model)  \nvmassol - (09:36): CalebJamesDeLisl: give me 3 mn, I need to disconnect and reconnect in my office...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:37): ok  \nvmassol left at 09:37 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 09:38  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:39): I have been watching videos (lazy) so I am learning more about Guice since it's well discussed on youtube.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:40): Another feature which looks intriguing is the scope, request scope could replace the context -> less trusted code.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 09:40  \nvmassol - (09:42): you're talking about jsr299 now?  \nvmassol - (09:42): because yes the scopes there are interesting for us too  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:42): They both support it AFAIK.  \nvmassol - (09:42): personally I don't see the future for guice right now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:43): I would agree except that Google will not want to port their code.  \nvmassol - (09:43): it's not as if they'll have the choice  \nvmassol - (09:43): and it's not really google, it's more Bob  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:44): I understand that most of the google projects are using it right now.  \nvmassol - (09:44): so it all depends how many fwks/libraries/servlet engines adopt 299  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:45): If history is an indicator, the worst option will be standardized ;)  \nvmassol - (09:45): sure, that would be guice 3  \nvmassol - (09:45): ;)  \nvmassol - (09:45): (not answering your last point in my reply)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:46): Are there other compelling options other than Guice and 299?  \nvmassol - (09:46): osgi  \nvmassol - (09:47): more specifically  \nvmassol - (09:47): osgi DS, osgi dependency manager or iPojo  \nvmassol - (09:47): see http://felix.apache.org/site/index.html  \nvmassol - (09:47): but the only compelling solution to me is 299 right now  \nvmassol - (09:47): I don't see why we would move from a non standard api (ours) to another non standard api  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:48): We have a few options in how we decide which road to take. We can either look for a potential standard, or look for what provides for our needs best.  \nvmassol - (09:48): (the only reason I could \u00a0see would be to gain osgi support built in, as with guice + peaberry, if it proves well done)  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 09:48  \nvmassol - (09:49): CalebJamesDeLisl: you don't agree with what I proposed?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:49): Which part?  \nvmassol - (09:49): the roadmap  \nvmassol - (09:49): step1, 2, 3, etc  \nvmassol - (09:49): in any case  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:50): I certainly wouldn't -1 it but I think we should do cost/benifits on each option.  \nvmassol - (09:50): for the short term, it all depends how successful or not is the poc I'm doing  \nvmassol - (09:50): CalebJamesDeLisl: that\"'s exactly what I did  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:51): I suspected as much, and I'm sorry to bring it up again, but I didn't really see that presented.  \nvmassol - (09:51): (but I didn't show it all for sure, was lazy to write that mail ;) Actually I wanted to blog about it but didn't take the time yet)  \nvmassol - (09:51): so that's why I said, ask questions in the meantile  \nvmassol - (09:51): meantimez  \nvmassol - (09:51): meantime  \nvmassol - (09:51): in any case you're 100% free to suggest other ideas  \nvmassol - (09:52): and we can discuss them  \nvmassol - (09:52): but talking without any evidence will not bring us too far  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:52): Well, if we are to look purely from an implementation standpoint, Guice is integrated with GWT, and 299 will likely have some synergy with Hibernate and jbosscache.  \nvmassol - (09:53): I don't see why any of these would matter  \nvmassol - (09:53): they're really small stuff compared to the larger picture IMO  \nvmassol - (09:54): as an example our current comp model doesn't prevent us from using any of these  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:54): The larger picture being that one of these standards is going to be the betacord?  \nvmassol - (09:54): first as I mentioend in the mail we need to focus on our needs  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 09:54  \nvmassol - (09:54): the need is the extension manager  \nvmassol - (09:55): that's our #1 need  \nvmassol - (09:55): the comp model is really far far behind  \nvmassol - (09:55): since we already have a working one  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:55): I think either of the options will be satisfactory for that need, am I wrong?  \nvmassol - (09:56): jsr299 not really  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:56): Ahh yes because of the hot loaded components.  \nvmassol - (09:56): weld a bit more but not quite  \nvmassol - (09:57): all that remains for me to understand is what hack they use in guice for peaberry  \nvmassol - (09:57): since guice doesn't support dynamic comp either  \nvmassol - (09:57): and in the meantime I'm evaluating how much it costs to simply plugin osgi in our existing model  \nvmassol - (09:58): (learning osgi at the same time since that's needed anyway)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:58): Dynamic loading not supported in guice?  \noanat joined #xwiki at 09:59  \nvmassol - (09:59): how do you do it?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:59): I thought I heard it was, but now I can't remember where.  \nvmassol - (09:59): it's definitely not built for doing that  \nvmassol - (10:00): now it's certainly since peaberry has found some way for doign it  \nvmassol - (10:00): s/since/possible since/  \nvmassol - (10:01): but it's not meant to be simple or even planned from the onset  \nvmassol - (10:01): otherwise it would be documented, in the base feature set, etc  \nvmassol - (10:01): (you wouldn't need another fwk to do it)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:01): I guess you would have to get the root injector and call inject because there would be no dependencies on the new class.  \nvmassol - (10:02): you can read: http://www.slideshare.net/mcculls/dynamic-guice-applications-3657876  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:02): Lots of tabs in the browser...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:03): Here's a funny one: http://www.tomscott.com/stupidfight/ \u00a0little ajax code which pulls a twitter page and analyzes the intelligence of the followers.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:03): stupid += rCount(msg.toLowerCase(),/(lol|omg|wtf|ftw|\\&lt\\;3|luv|xo|yr|wit\\W|\\Wur\\W|btw|rofl|lmao|stfu)/g) \\* 5;  \nnpm left at 10:05 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:08): I see the problem, the bindings are static so you can't hot swap implementations.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:09): The obvious hack would be using providers which give us whatever implementation they want.  \nvmassol - (10:09): btw peaberry has its own guice jar  \nvmassol - (10:09): with several patches applied to it  \nvmassol - (10:10): for ex: http://bit.ly/92cVMt  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:10): As far as what standard will 'win' maybe the answer is none, maybe they will all me adjusted and melded together.  \nvmassol - (10:11): standards always win  \nvmassol - (10:12): it lowers the cost for everyone  \nvmassol - (10:12): at all levels  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:13): Well one standard's name always ends up being used, but the benefits of guice may influence changes to 299 or vice versa.  \nvmassol - (10:13): definitely  \nvmassol - (10:14): it alreayd has  \nvmassol - (10:14): since 299 was done based on guice  \nvmassol - (10:14): :)  \nvmassol - (10:14): which is why I hate it  \nvmassol - (10:14): since it didn't take into account dynamic bean loading!  \nvmassol - (10:14): registration I mean  \nvmassol - (10:14): :)  \nvmassol - (10:14): since they looked at guice but not at Osgi for ex  \nvmassol - (10:14): so 299 is really a standardization of guice + seam  \nvmassol - (10:15): I hope a revised version of 299 will appear in the future to take into accoutn dynamic registration use cases  \nvmassol - (10:15): in any case I have no doubt that Weld and others will support it  \nvmassol - (10:15): whether it's in the spec or not  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:16): What exactly do we need to load dynamically? new interfaces or are we hot switching implementation?  \nvmassol - (10:16): here's a thread:  \nvmassol - (10:16): http://www.seamframework.org/Community/DynamicRegistrationOfBeans  \nvmassol - (10:16): you'll find some use cases in there  \nvmassol - (10:16): that should be familiar to you  \nvmassol - (10:16): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:17): Yup, that was linked in the email.  \nSvenDowideit\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:18  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:18): Guice has @Singleton and @LazySingleton, this makes me thing the world does not need to be built at startup.  \nSvenDowideit left at 10:18 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nSvenDowideit\\_ is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nvmassol - (10:18): yes that's Instance<?> in 299  \nvmassol - (10:18): (the lazy part)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:19): So (in guice) why not just get the static Guice.inject and use it to start the class in the middle.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:19): ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:20): That is as long as we don't need to swap implementations of interface xyz.  \nvmassol - (10:20): the solution they use in peaberry AFAIU is to use a mediator  \nvmassol - (10:20): but I don't fully understand it yet  \nvmassol - (10:20): so I won't be able to answer your questions  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:21): I think part of the problem is that the advocates of different standards like to throw rocks so little problems turn into major blockers.  \nSvenDowideit\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:23  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:24): I see two possible use cases which have to be separated. One is to load a package which gets the benefits of injection but no internal code depends on it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:25): The other would be to hot swap an internal class for an added class. If the class is singleton than this is impossible.  \nSvenDowideit left at 10:25 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nSvenDowideit\\_ is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:26): Example of #2 would be loading an implementation of the XWikiCaptchaService which replaces the internal one.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:27): Of course captcha service is singleton so the puzzle answers which are in the cache go missing in the swap.  \narkub left at 10:33 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \ngvallarelli joined #xwiki at 10:34  \ngvallarelli - (10:34): hello  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 10:35  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 10:37  \narkub joined #xwiki at 10:48  \nEnygma` left at 10:57 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 11:01  \nSvenDowideit\\_ joined #xwiki at 11:11  \nSvenDowideit left at 11:13 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 11:14  \nSvenDowideit\\_ left at 11:17 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nSvenDowideit left at 11:18 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nSvenDowideit\\_ joined #xwiki at 11:18  \nSvenDowideit\\_ is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nSvenDowideit left at 11:25 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 11:25  \nSvenDowideit left at 11:34 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 11:35  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:35): Don't know if you saw this: http://jfpoilpret.blogspot.com/2008/07/dynamically-loading-guice-modules-as.html  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:36): Looks like what I imagined, you have to call the root loader to load each module. \u00a0Unloading might be trickier.  \nmflorea left at 11:38 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 11:41  \njvelo - (12:02): vmassol, re \"I'm not sure the import UI was heavily designed/reviewed / I have various nitpicks with it ;)\"  \njvelo - (12:02): please let me know about it  \nvmassol - (12:02): jvelo: hehe took you some time to react ;)  \njvelo - (12:02): s/it/them/  \nvmassol - (12:02): that message was for you indeed :)  \nvmassol - (12:02): we talked about them already  \njvelo - (12:02): was probably busy or not in the room  \nvmassol - (12:02): but yes I could make a list  \nvmassol - (12:02): and send it to the dev lists  \njvelo - (12:02): if we did then I don  \njvelo - (12:03): 't recall  \nvmassol - (12:03): we talked about ti when I upgraded myxwiki.org  \njvelo - (12:03): There is one issue I have in mind that JV & I discussed  \nvmassol - (12:03): with jv and you  \njvelo - (12:03): it's the fact you can't expand all spaces  \nvmassol - (12:03): yes that's one  \njvelo - (12:03): (to be able to search for names)  \nvmassol - (12:03): ok I'll try to find some time to list them  \njvelo - (12:03): that's relatively easy to add, we need to find the proper place for the links in the UI  \njvelo - (12:03): ok  \nvmassol - (12:03): (no guaratnee though, I reall yneed to start preparing my training session....)  \nglerouge joined #xwiki at 12:04  \nCiprian joined #xwiki at 12:04  \njvdrean left at 12:13 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu left at 12:34 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 12:34  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 12:40  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 12:42  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 12:48  \njvelo left at 12:52 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 12:52  \nflorinciu left at 13:22 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 13:39  \njvelo left at 14:10 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 14:25  \nflorinciu left at 14:31 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvelo left at 14:48 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 15:12  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 15:16  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 15:34  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 15:35  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 15:49  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 15:55  \ntemporalfox - (15:55): hi everyone  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 15:56  \nlucaa - (15:56): hi temporalfox  \ntemporalfox - (15:56): about me : I'm Julien Viet working for the eXo Platform company  \ntemporalfox - (15:56): hacking a bit xwiki model and rendering engine to write a converter for docbook  \ntemporalfox - (15:57): temporalfox is an acronym of eXo Platform  \nvmassol - (15:57): (for those who haven't noticed temporalfox is an anagram for exoplatform ;) julien: it's a cool name)  \nvmassol - (15:57): my name is: iwikx  \nvmassol - (15:57): hmm not as nice  \nvmassol - (15:57): ;)  \nlucaa - (15:58): but you vmassol, knew it, before right? your permutations capability is not that instant, is it?  \nvmassol - (15:58): hey I'm a scrabble champion!  \nEnygma` left at 15:58 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntemporalfox - (15:58): I used this website to find the anagram : http://wordsmith.org/anagram/advanced.html  \nvmassol - (15:58): was ranked 400th worldwide in the past....  \nlucaa - (15:58): ok, ok.
