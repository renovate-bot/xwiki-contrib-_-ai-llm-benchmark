Interested in bringing your wiki to life? Then you can use XWiki's powerful programming API right from your wiki pages. XWiki comes with support for [several scripting languages: **Velocity**, **Groovy**, **Python**, **Ruby**, and even **PHP**](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/Scripting).\n\nXWiki exposes APIs that allow you to easily manipulate the wiki and its pages.\n\nTo whet your appetite, simply add the following code to your page:\n\n{{velocity}}  \n#set($query = \"where doc.parent is null or doc.parent='' order by doc.name asc\")  \n  \n#foreach($item in $services.query.xwql($query).execute())  \n#set($orphanedDoc = $xwiki.getDocument($item))  \n\u00a0\u00a0\\* [[$orphanedDoc.displayTitle>>$orphanedDoc]] (located in space //$orphanedDoc.space//, contains $orphanedDoc.attachmentList.size() attachments)  \n#end  \n{{/velocity}}You'll get a list of orphaned pages (i.e. pages that have no parent). For example:\n\n![velocityexampleresult.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Programming/velocityexampleresult.png?rev=1.1)\n\nCheck the **[Developer's Guide](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/)** and especially the **[XWiki Scripting section](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/Scripting)** to learn more.\n\nYou might also want to check out the **[Snippets wiki](https://snippets.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/)**, which contains a lot of code snippets that you can reuse in your pages. And you can also check out the **[Extensions wiki](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/)** to install ready-to-use extensions built using these mechanisms.\n\n\n"}
