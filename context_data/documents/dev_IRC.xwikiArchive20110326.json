\u00a0my hope is to enable the programming, but write some code that will enable dynamic updates of the pages as modification to existing content will be necessary  \n21:15\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I understand there is a script service for handling XML documents.  \n21:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0sdumitriu: Is the XMLScriptService documented anywhere?  \n21:18\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n21:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe I'll take that as a no  \n21:20\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has quit  \n21:23\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Anyway, there is this: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-xml/xwiki-xml-script/src/main/java/org/xwiki/xml/internal/XMLScriptService.java  \n21:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't see any documentation on it.  \n21:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It should allow you to put into a page:  \n21:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0{{velocity}} $services.xml.parse('<p>something</p>') {{/velocity}}  \n21:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Which will return a org.w3c.dom.Document  \n21:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:37\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0would this implementation support xwiki page creation/updating from an xml feed?  \n21:38\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0<cjdelisle> sorry I missed out on the initial part of your response... darned guest wifi here at the hospital cut me off and I only received your reply starting with \"Anyway, there is this:\"  \n21:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0You would have to create the document programmtically  \n21:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://lists.xwiki.org/pipermail/users/2010-February/019480.html  \n21:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0There is a description of how to create documents using script.  \n21:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a016:29 <+cjdelisle> Anyway, there is this:  \n21:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-xml/xwiki-xml-script/src/main/java/org/xwiki/xml/internal/XMLScriptService.java  \n21:40\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0<cjdelisle> ahh, thanks for that  \n21:40\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^that is the code to a parser which is included in xwiki and will allow you to parse and manipulate XML documents.  \n21:41\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0did you get this part?  \n21:41\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a016:30 <+cjdelisle> {{velocity}} $services.xml.parse('<p>something</p>') {{/velocity}}  \n21:41\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0yes, thank you... so as i understand this... the content is created upon the instance the page is accessed?  \n21:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0You're talking about getDocument()?  \n21:43\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0i.e. not so similar to the RESTful API's use of PUT/POST methods  \n21:44\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not sure which you are talking about. are you refering to \"how to create the document programmtically\"?  \n21:45\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0I shall read more and respond with something hopefully a little more intellectual  \n21:45\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0very much appreciate the push in the direction here  \n21:45\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Sure thing, always feel free to ask.  \n21:52\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:08\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has quit  \n22:10\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:42\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0<cjdelisle> RE: XMLScriptService.java ...this looks to be a Utility class... however this looks to only have static methods. \u00a0Not so sure this would work but will continue reading. \u00a0I am hopeful this might still somehow fit a use case similar to \"we need someone to integrate an XML feed which provides inventory.\"  \n22:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0bbc581: It can be used from the wiki, from Velocity scripts  \n22:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0$services.xml.parse($content)  \n22:45\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0ahh.. thanks for that  \n22:45\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:45\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:04\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:14\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n23:18\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
