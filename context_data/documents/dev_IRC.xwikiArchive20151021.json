recent version of that macro, you should put it on xwiki-contrib and release it over that one  \n17:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since that page links to

\n17:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for the moment, I do not intend to put it in a repos, too much overhead for the purpose, but I will put a new version on e.x.o and mark it installable with EM
