I need to display some content on an wiki by using the locale passed into query string and I'm in velocity. Any idea?  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(using XWiki 8.4)  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed the localization SS is only looking at current locale right now  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you could change the current locale in the context but you would need PR I think  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep and I'd need to some try/finally  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is hard in velocity  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I could work around by using groovy FTM  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not very nice)  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but doable in my case)  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(PR is not so much an issue)  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0isn't #try/#catch enough for this ?  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's only #try  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it'll fill the $exception binding only if there's an ecception  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I could work  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/I/it  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you're right it should be enough actually  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll still need PR but at least it's simpler and acceptable if we don't have any better solution  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll create a jira issue for the future  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now the chance of getting an exception while calling render() is almost non existant  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13891  \n11:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:55\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n13:28\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@gdelhumeau: I have some comment on the new language settings in 8.4.
