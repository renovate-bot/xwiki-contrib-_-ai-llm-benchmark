Thanks!  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:01): Once the password is changed, you get out of XWiki  \nsdumitriu - (14/07/2009 18:02): You're welcome  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:02): I guess this is the desirable behaviour  \nsdumitriu - (14/07/2009 18:02): Yes, since the cookie does not match anymore  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:02): ok  \nsdumitriu - (14/07/2009 18:02): It could be improved in the future, but it's not a priority now  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:02): I get the point  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:03): I hope this issue has helped a bit to improve XWiki!  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:03): :-)  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:04): By the way, I've new issues with 2.0m1 running on Vista. Something related to no-ascii characters. I've no access to this box right now, I'll try again tomorrow morning and send a message to the list  \nsdumitriu - (14/07/2009 18:04): Note that 2.0 uses UTF-8 as the encoding  \nsdumitriu - (14/07/2009 18:04): Make sure you properly configure your database  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:07): I am sure this is perfectly clear in the readme file :-(  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:08): I'll check this tomorrow. I've had no problem with an installation on a Mac OS X box, but I am not able to write and store \u00e1\u00e9\u00ed\u00f3\u00fa in the Windows Vista one. I'll keep you posted!  \nsdumitriu - (14/07/2009 18:08): Yep, most likely a database encoding issue  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:10): One of these days I will get a proper server to install this EPEC Network thing! Thanks for your work!  \nrrodriguez - (14/07/2009 18:19): Moving to a new location!
