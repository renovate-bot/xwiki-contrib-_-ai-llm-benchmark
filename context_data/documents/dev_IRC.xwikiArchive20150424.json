 \n17:22\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Because it doesn't display anything at the moment, and I don't really know where to look  \n17:22\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:22\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(note: this is a custom xwiki based on packager tool)  \n17:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(I've added xwiki-platform-flamingo-theme and xwiki-platform-icon-fontawesome as dependencies in my build)  \n17:25\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Any idea?  \n17:27\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry no idea\u2026 and Guillaume is on holidays right now  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he's back next week though :)  \n17:30\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Looking into style.css that is loaded, it seems that there is a lot about Glyphicon but I didn't find anything about Font-Awesome  \n17:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Could it be that I'm missing Less :-)  \n17:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And then I fallback to a default icon  \n17:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I'll look at this  \n17:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0vmassol: Yes, I know I'm asking this kind of question the bad day :-\\  \n17:31\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0woshilapin: you should use $services.icon  \n17:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0All of the icons are not mapped  \n17:31\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0glyphicon is used only in menus\u2026 comes from Bootstrap  \n17:32\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Maybe I need to manually load Font-Awesome StyleSheetExtension if I want to go without $services.icon?  \n17:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0this is the mapping http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/XWiki+Icon+Set  \n17:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, I'm aware about this mapping  \n17:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And some of the icons I want to use are not in it  \n17:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0if you want to go without the $services.icon \u2026 than you are using FontAwesome .. as it is. it's documented on their website how to call them \"<i class=\"fa fa-cart-plus\"></i>  \n17:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0\"  \n17:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, but the icon is not displayed if I do this  \n17:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0It's like Font-awesome stylesheet is not loaded  \n17:35\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(I'm not even sure how to check that correctly unless looking into all the CSS that are loaded)  \n17:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0in the case the icons don't exist \u2026 and you know a mapping also for Silk, you create an issue on jira, like this http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11533  \n17:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well \u2026 first I think you should see in EM\u2026 if the Icon Themes App is installed right  \n17:36\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Aouch, I don't even have the EM installed with this custom build  \n17:37\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I probably need to look the correct maven module for this extension  \n17:37\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0is it not this one xwiki-platform-icon-fontawesome  \n17:37\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0?  \n17:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Icon+Theme+Application  \n17:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Font+Awesome+Icon+Theme  \n17:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0View Source on the second link is broken  \n17:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0But anyway, I think xwiki-platform-icon-fontawesome should be fine since one of the dependency is Icon Theme Application  \n17:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0fixed  \n17:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Ah, too fast for me :-)  \n17:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Thanks  \n17:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0np  \n17:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, so given what you told me, I should have anything I need  \n17:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I'll try to manually load the StyleSheetExtension at least to see if it works  \n17:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0in the worst case scenario you can also use http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Font+Awesome+Icon+Macro  \n17:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Thanks for the info  \n17:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0or manually use the CDN http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/  \n17:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0np  \n17:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Adding this seems to work  \n17:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0#set($discard = $xwiki.ssx.use('IconThemes.FontAwesome'))  \n17:50\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Additionnal question, can I configure in my build (in some pom.xml) some values from WebPreferences (like Icon theme and Color Theme)?  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the question is whether these properties can be configured in xwiki.properties I guess  \n17:51\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0If they can, then I already know how to do it but can I configure Color Theme and Icon Theme in xwiki.properties?  \n17:52\u00a0\\*\u00a0woshilapin is looking into xwiki.properties...  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know, to know you need to find the code  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if the code users a default ConfigurationSource then the answer will be yes  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now everything is possible  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can modify WebPreferences from your build too  \n17:54\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0WebPreferences, it's an object, right?  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems GD hasn't considered these as configuration which is bad  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(bad design I mean)  \n17:55\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Ah, XWiki.XWikiPreferences is an object  \n17:55\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0So with XAR plugin, I should be able to modify values during the build  \n17:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know the code but I see: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/45129372dbe1ec793586/raw/8a5d680ef573b9259dd95fbe00c53104084cd853/gistfile1.txt  \n17:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0woshilapin: no  \n17:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a plugin to make a change to a wiki page as part of hte build  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki-platform-tool-xmldoc-update-plugin  \n17:57\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/XARPlugin  \n17:57\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I see something about modifying XWiki.XWikiPreferences in this link  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes indeed I forgot that I did this too ;)  \n17:58\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0:-)  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm awesome ;)  \n17:58\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0So, what's the best option then, since you know both solutions  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XAR plugin  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's more recent  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the purpose is different actually  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XAR plugin is wen you're generating a XAR  \n17:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, cool  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you'll need that anyway  \n17:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0idk if we do that here, that's what we do in our channels  \n18:00\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Can I do that in the generation of the distribution (packager plugin)?  \n18:00\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Ah no, wait, I know where I'll do it  \n18:00\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Forget about it  \n18:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0However, I'm not sure I completely understand how to read it. \u00a0For example, line 173 (requirement 150), the column AG say \"WP3-targeted\" but in column AS, it says that this requirement is not targeted. \u00a0Since a comment from WP2 is needed in \"Consensus\" (column AX), I'm not sure what to comment, even more since this requirement looks clearly WP3 to me.  \n18:21\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Oups, wrong chat  \n18:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0However, I'm not sure I completely understand the layout. For example, line 173 column AG says \"WP3-targeted\" but in column AS says not targeted. If you could clarify the meaning of \"not targeted\" in this context that would be great.  \n18:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok you can have your channel back now  \n18:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:38\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:16\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n19:56\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n23:25\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:54\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
