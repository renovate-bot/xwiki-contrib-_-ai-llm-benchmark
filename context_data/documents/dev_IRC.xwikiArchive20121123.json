Have you read my comment ?  \n09:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Good morning :)  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: I havn't followed the issue but it's set as a blocker for the release and we're behind a lot already  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've read your comment  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you see we need to write a new migration  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/see/say  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to decide how we progress for the release  \n09:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0no a new migration, but a new feature for migrator maybe  \n09:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0s/no/not/  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0in fact the migrator arrive too late  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the question is: when could you work on this since it's a blocker for the release? All our hopes rely on you since I'm not who else would be able to work on this :)  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw this is new for 4.3 right? It wasn't happening before when migrating to 4.2?  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes R43000XWIKI6691DataMigration was added in 4.3  \n09:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yes, it XWIKI-6691 was already postponed in 3.5 for similar reason  \n09:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0s/it/and/  \n09:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: what is annoying is that we saw this only after RC1, we are late and I do not like putting new feature at that stage in hurry  \n09:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I tested this before RC1 but using the old method, and I didn't have it  \n09:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0so either the old migration testing method is not good, or something triggers the issue after RC1  \n09:27\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the old method ?  \n09:27\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0Denis: yes, the one we were using. By starting another clean container instead of replacing just the war  \n09:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I do not see what this could change in this issue  \n09:28\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0me neither  \n09:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0note that this issue was not blocking, would it be possible you missed the stacktrace ?  \n09:30\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0no, it's not possible. not after testing this 5+ times  \n09:31\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I didn't say it was blocking or stopping the user from using the wiki. I marked it as a blocker because I always mark failed migrations as blockers because usually a failed migration puts the db in consistent state.  \n09:31\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I guess this doesn't happend in this case, but I am not an expert on this field  \n09:32\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0stacktrace in the log should be blocker, but I really do not understand why we fail on this only now  \n09:32\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0me neither  \n09:32\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0oddly nobody on the lists complained about this, so this must be someting new  \n09:36\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: concretely, I need to add a new method on HibernateDataMigration interface, similar to the existing one, for getting another liquibase changelog, implement it in the abstract class, upgrade the HibernateMigrationManager to use it, and finally use it in R43000.  \n09:37\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0This does not look too hard, I may write the code quickly this morning, but I will not test it deeply, if Sorin could do so, and we agree on this way to go, I start right now  \n09:40\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mmm, based on that new feature, R40000 may be improved as well, but not sure I risk that right now as well  \n09:40\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: WDTH ?  \n09:40\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0yes, I can re-test when your commit gets in the packages  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0sburjan`: you will have to check not only migration, \u00a0but also initial installation and new wiki, and on all DBs  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back, reading  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: sounds good  \n09:49\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0Denis: depends how much vmassol is giving me  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well do we have a choice?  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's either:  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) we consider this issue not blocking for 4.3 and fix it later on in 4.3.1  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) we fix it  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we agree that 1) is not good?  \n09:50\u00a0<Denis>\u00a03) we revert it  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n09:50\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0still, if db is consistent when performing the second restart, we should be pretty safe as far as I understood fom Denis  \n09:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0sure but there is a weird stacktrace at startup the first time  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6691 right?  \n09:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0right  \n09:51\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0anyway, you know better the technical stuff.
