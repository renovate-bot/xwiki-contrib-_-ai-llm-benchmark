 \n10:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: the import UI is broken  \n10:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can't select all pages anymore  \n10:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and that's what cause the failing tests (since the test expect all the pages to be selected by default)  \n10:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0are you using the documentTree macro in import or the tree macro?  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the import UI is a template  \n10:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right, so you are using the tree widget, building the html  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n10:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0my change moved the documentTree macro around, so I`m not sure why it should impact you  \n10:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0on the other hand, mflorea recently introduced the tree navigator in the breadcrumb  \n10:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this introduces more than one tree in the same page (breadcrumbs + import)  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0everything is working well (you can select any page you want and the tree is display an behave as expected) except for check\\_all() which is a jstree method as far as I can see  \n10:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0not sure how your selectors are written in the javascript for import, but from what I noticed in the create UI, there can be interference  \n10:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0specially since there are now multiple occurences of the same ID in the dom  \n10:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, you need to make sure the selector is specific enough  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again the selction is not a import UI feature  \n10:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since each tree uses IDs and if we display the same document in multiple trees, we end up with the same ID multiple times in the DOM  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0single selection works well  \n10:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I mean the selector used when you create the import tree  \n10:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: multiple occurrances of the same ID is an issue though, IMO  \n10:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0depends how you use those ID  \n10:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I know you can be specific enough to avoid the problem, but from a validation pov, it`s not really ok  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0import UI does not select the tree using an id but using .xtree class  \n10:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: this.xtree = $.jstree.reference($('.xtree'));  \n10:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that can return either the import tree or a tree from the breadcrumbs  \n10:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0stuff like that needs to be more specific, since now we have multiple xtree instances in the same page  \n10:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this messed with the create tests as well  \n10:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying to change the selector  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the things is the line above which is also based on class select the proper element  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise there would not be any select box in the tree  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*checkbox  \n11:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:20\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: the breadcrumb now triggers xwiki:dom:updated :)  \n11:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0great, I'll update the tree navigation. Thanks!  \n11:42\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the two failing test on document index are the same wrong tree issue  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0timing is similar and looks like the test is claiming that it can't find something \u00a0can see in the screenshot  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(one node of the document index tree)  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep same thing  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@FindBy(className = \"xtree\")  \n11:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it's probably not the only one, looks like selecting by using xtree class is common, hope it did not break too many extensions  \n12:32\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: various AWM test are failing because the id of the app name field changed from appName to appTitle, is this expected ?  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(the name of the field is still appName, only the id changed)  \n12:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, expected, I need to update the page objects  \n12:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm fixing the class sheet test now  \n12:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll check the AWM tests afterwards  \n12:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n12:47\u00a0<gilesparnell>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:49\u00a0<gilesparnell>\u00a0has quit  \n12:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: i'm on the PO already, just wanted to be sure it's expected  \n12:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: I fixed several classsheet issue by the way  \n12:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0caused by the rename of some links  \n12:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(\"document\" -> \"page\")  \n13:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: have you committed the changes to the class sheet po?
