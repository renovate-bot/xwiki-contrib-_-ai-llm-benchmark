 \nvmassol - (15:02): since it doesn't have much to do with XWiki class  \nvmassol - (15:02): yes it's called getAvailableParserSyntaxes()  \ntmortagne - (15:03): the there should be the renderer one  \ntmortagne - (15:03): s/the/then/  \nvmassol - (15:03): yep  \nvmassol - (15:04): testing on availability of PrintRendererFactory ?  \nvmassol - (15:05): answer: yes  \ntmortagne - (15:05): yes i think since that's what we use in XWiki  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 15:15  \nvmassol - (15:20): sdumitriu: just found that the hierarchy is printed now, cool  \nvmassol - (15:21): (I had tried a few days ago and it wasn't printed)  \nsdumitriu - (15:21): It is, except on the main page where it shouldn't be visible  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 15:25  \nvmassol - (15:31): hmm js experts: shouldn't I be able to see the js injected by a $jsx.use(\u2026) when I view source in my browser?  \ntmortagne - (15:32): vmassol: nop jsextension are linked, not inserted  \ntmortagne - (15:34): but you can see the result by using the same link you can find in the head  \nvmassol - (15:34): right, trying to find the link  \ntmortagne - (15:34): (don't remember exactly the format)  \nvmassol - (15:34): found it thanks  \ntmortagne - (15:36): np  \nvmassol - (15:38): tmortagne: actually the conversion feature seems broken  \nvmassol - (15:38): I don't get it either when converting from syntax 1.0 to 2.0  \ntmortagne - (15:38): should be pretty recent since it's working in 2.4  \ntmortagne - (15:38): did not checked in 2.4.3pre  \ntmortagne - (15:39): would have been nice to upgrade myxwiki.org to 2.5M1  \nvmassol - (15:48): tmortagne: ok I'm ready to commit my changes to support any syntaxes in the conversion but this means the panels app will require core 2.5M2\u2026. ok?  \ntmortagne - (15:49): vmassol: panels app is already not compatible with 2.4  \ntmortagne - (15:49): that's the cause of 2.4.3 ;)  \ntmortagne - (15:52): vmassol: syntax conversion is working well in 2.4.3 so that's a trunk specific bug  \ntmortagne - (15:53): (cf \"actually the conversion feature seems broken\")  \nvmassol - (15:53): tmortagne: can you reproduce too?  \ntmortagne - (15:53): i checked on 2.4.3  \ntmortagne - (15:54): i will try but i need to finish review your commit first ;)  \ntmortagne - (15:54): anyway if you fix it right now it's ok  \nvmassol - (15:55): hmm trying to add a runtime dep to the panels module but not working right now for some reason  \nvmassol - (15:56): I get http://tinypaste.com/826a5  \nvmassol - (15:56): (if you have any idea....)  \nflaviusolaru - (15:57): hi all, quick question: have we modified escapetool? it is generating me a {{\\/html}} at the end  \nvmassol - (15:57): ah I know  \nvmassol - (15:57): it must be because of SNAPSHOT  \ntmortagne - (15:57): vmassol: why don't you put simply 2.5-milestone-1 ?  \nvmassol - (15:58): tmortagne: i want to indicate it requires 2.5-milestone-2 and above actually  \nvmassol - (15:58): but since it's not released I cannot  \ntmortagne - (15:58): i think that's actually what it means by default  \nvmassol - (15:58): nope  \nvmassol - (15:58): that means exactly 2.5-milestone-1  \nvmassol - (15:58): so for ex if you have 2.6 in your repo  \nvmassol - (15:58): it won't resolve  \nsdumitriu - (16:00): 2.6 will be selected if there are multiple dependencies with various needs  \nsdumitriu - (16:00): Since the same artefact can't be used twice  \nvmassol - (16:00): it's possible version ranges only work after aether was introduced  \nsdumitriu - (16:00): But yes, 2.5M1 means 2.5M1 exactly  \ntmortagne - (16:02): vmassol: aether has just been introduced in maven 3 trunk, pretty sure there is already version range support in maven 2  \nvmassol - (16:02): maybe \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<version>(2.5-SNAPSHOT,)</version> is good enough  \nvmassol - (16:02): tmortagne: there is but I seem to remember it was not working well  \nvmassol - (16:03): ok <version>(2.5-SNAPSHOT,)</version> is working locally for me  \nvmassol - (16:03): so I'll use that for now  \ntmortagne - (16:03): vmassol: btw ( is exclusive quantifier  \ntmortagne - (16:03): you need [ here i think  \nvmassol - (16:03): yes  \nvmassol - (16:03): strange that it works :)  \ntmortagne - (16:03): yep  \nvmassol - (16:04): maybe 2.5-milestone-1 is considered newer  \ntmortagne - (16:04): but since we are using mainly maven 2 I hope that will not be an issue for releases  \nvmassol - (16:04): that would explain it at least  \ntmortagne - (16:05): plus i did not added version range support in extension manager yet ;)  \nneruda joined #xwiki at 16:12  \nneruda left at 16:12 (Changing host  \nneruda joined #xwiki at 16:12  \nneruda left at 16:12 (Changing host  \nneruda joined #xwiki at 16:12  \nneruda - (16:13): how can i check out the source code for the latest stable build of xwiki?  \nvmassol - (16:14): any js expert here to diagnose why syntax conversion is not working anymore when converting from 1.0 syntax to 2.0 syntax on trunk?  \ntmortagne - (16:14): neruda: see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SourceRepository#HBuildingaspecificversionofXWikiEnterprise  \nvmassol - (16:17): is there any way to tell skin extension not to remove all whitespaces/new lines so that you can put breakpoints?
