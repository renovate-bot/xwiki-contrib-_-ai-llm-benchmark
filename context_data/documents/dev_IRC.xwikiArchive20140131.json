(macros, getdocument methods, etc.)  \n10:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as accurate as possible is still better than nothing :)  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and what I have in main is allow to do it explicitly in case it's too complex for automated ways  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example putting an object in AllDocs indicating that it depends on well all docs :) That way if any document is modified AllDocs rendering cache would be invalidated  \n10:32\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0i agree :) but i can think of two possibilities here - 1) document checks if someone is using him (would require to parse every document) - unaccurate (if its triggered on change) / too slow (on every view), 2) document check what uses (parse content and discover documents, checks their status, etc.), this could be done on update, but what about dynamic loading? (queries and such) -> so this also has to be done on every view  \n10:33\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0and if wiki doesn't have caching, its another slowing down (and still no way to flush cache programmatically)  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as long as anyone can indicate explicit link we can do the automated once that are not an issue for performances when we find ways to do it  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the automated links would be bonuses  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0binding for macros and static content should be doable, xwikidocument could have timestamp property indicating cache time and list of document to monitor and on every rendering it would check if any of those documents has newer timestamp (in that case it wouldn't require scanning for documents on every view, only on edit)  \n10:55\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: well, this should do the on-demand flushing - https://github.com/DarkKnightCZ/xwiki-platform/commit/7ac3ce5630eee49fa191511b91be3b73d6d1ec5b (tested on 5.4), i'm just not sure if this is the best way to obtain XWikiDocument  \n11:00\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: hello  \n11:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0can you tell me the exact steps you did for XWIKI-9955 ?  \n11:10\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0when I tried to migrate from 4.5.4 to 5.4rc1 I first clicked Continue and then Later and I was able to reproduce the bug  \n11:10\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0If I click Later at the beginning I get Main.WebHome with the old UI  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: I don't see how you could have the exact same thing you should have a new text saying \"No document were modified during this Distribution Wizard.\"  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm wait  \n11:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I know.

I don't even know if that's possible  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: yes this is in case DW does nothing so an upgrade with no change (never knows...)  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this time it's in the right place  \n11:24\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: ok.
