Although yours seems ok. Maybe try a more recent one that matches your postgresql version? (make sure to pick a jdbc 4.1 driver)  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it still fails, I'll try to reproduce when I get some time, probably not before tomorrow though  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually if you have no luck with the driver please open a jira issue at http://jira.xwiki.org with the maximum of explanations of how to reproduce and what you tried  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thank a lot  \n12:27\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_9>\u00a0vmassol: ok thanks ;)  \n12:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_9: \u00a0it seems there is a current driver for Postgresql 9.4 at https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html \u00a0\u00a0... the driver for 9.3 should be compatible, though.  \n12:42\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0has quit  \n12:58\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n13:05\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n13:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n14:18\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:57\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0:-)  \n16:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_9>\u00a0has quit  \n17:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n17:43\u00a0<ClemensR1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:31\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<ClemensR1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:57\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:33\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n20:02\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:32\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0has quit  \n20:48\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:35\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0has quit  \n22:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:12\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:35\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
