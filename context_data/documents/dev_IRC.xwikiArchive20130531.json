I know you're biased (maybe ;-) but I'm trying to understand where one or the other might shine  \n21:03\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0timtimc: Liferay is more of a portal  \n21:04\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0With collaboration capabilies  \n21:04\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0XWiki is a web application development platform  \n21:04\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0With collaboration at its core  \n21:04\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0sdumitriu: so what would you define a portal as?  \n21:04\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Which one do you need?  \n21:04\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0interesting. we're looking for something to let our users create content, documentation , etc  \n21:04\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0and segregate with permissions  \n21:05\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Then XWiki is better  \n21:05\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0From Wikipedia: \"Intranet portal: a gateway that unifies access to all enterprise information and applications\"  \n21:05\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So a portal is a gateway  \n21:05\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0so when would you use a portal like liferay?  \n21:05\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0hmm...ok....  \n21:06\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm not that familiar with Liferay, reading now  \n21:06\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It seems that actually they're quite close to what XWiki does  \n21:07\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0They're also a \"web application framework\"  \n21:07\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0sdumitriu: I'm even more unsure now ;-)  \n21:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Still, I'd say go with XWiki if you're interested more in having one application as the intranet  \n21:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0A portal is supposed to be linking to other applications  \n21:13\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0sdumitriu: we want to do that too...I guess my big concern regarding either is ease of use in content creation. I'm not sure how well my users will understand the wiki way of doing things  \n21:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Do you mean wiki syntax editing, or the fact that they should edit everything?  \n21:14\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0I guess I'm concerned with things like wiki linking, etc. however, I think I need to dive deeper and give each a fair shot  \n21:14\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0I have about 3400 potential users  \n21:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep, always try things yourself  \n21:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0You're the one that knows what you need  \n21:16\u00a0<timtimc>\u00a0sdumitriu: k, thanks for your input ;)  \n22:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:53\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit\n"}
