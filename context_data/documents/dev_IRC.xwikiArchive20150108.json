However, vmassol suggested at some point that we remove the \"Configuration\" category since everything in Administration is about configuration, and that instead we have specific categories or, worst case, rename Configuration to Misc or General or something like that.  \n12:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: though it would be a bit confusing to have both Configuration > Wiki section and a Wikis category  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and I would not be that bad to have just a single Wiki > Descriptor section in a subwiki...  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I = it  \n12:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I think I still prefer the Wiki category in the end, just my feeling that it would be nicer it its own category instead of spread into 2 categories  \n12:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes, it would have been confusing, I agree  \n12:46\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n14:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0Hello I'm leaving the problem in XWiki button when I click it to get out of the HTTP Status 404 error  \n14:23\u00a0<mosulica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you mean there should be a button on the 404 page ?  \n14:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can edit the webapps/xwiki/templates/docdoesnotexist.vm \u00a0file if you do not like the standard 404 page  \n14:28\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0I think I was not clear when I click logout to exit the XWiki it give error 404  \n14:29\u00a0<mosulica>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0thank you  \n14:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok. logout should not be a 404, normally ...  \n15:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:17\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:20\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:28\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n17:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n17:59\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:07\u00a0<oldXwiki>\u00a0Well, looks like the xwiki ?width=xyz image problem that I had was a result of original jpgs with a color profile of \"sRGB IEC61966-2.1\" and the specific version of Java running Tomcat7: \u00a07u71-2.5.3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1  \n18:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<oldXwiki>\u00a0I downgraded to 7u51-2.4.6-1ubuntu4 and images are no longer \"red\" resized versions.  \n18:09\u00a0<oldXwiki>\u00a0It's likely due to: OpenJDK bug S8052162: REGRESSION: sun/java2d/cmm/ColorConvertOp tests fail since 7u71 b01  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n18:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:23\u00a0<martin-h>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n20:19\u00a0<oldXwiki>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:32\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:17\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
