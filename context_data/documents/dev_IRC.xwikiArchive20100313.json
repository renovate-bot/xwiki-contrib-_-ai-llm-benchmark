It's just to fix the rdfa  \nvmassol - (14:29): basically you need to do the following:  \nvmassol - (14:30): 1) edit the XWiki.XWikiSkins class and add a \"htmlheader.vm\" property of type Textarea  \nvmassol - (14:31): 2) go to the admin page, click on presentation and click on Customize button next to the skin  \nvmassol - (14:31): 3) copy paste the default htmlheader.vm in the htmlheader textarea:  \nbblfish - (14:32): ok, thanks, will do that, then go visit paris  \nvmassol - (14:32): wait finding the url for you  \nsdumitriu - (14:32): Alternative:  \nsdumitriu - (14:32): 1) make a local copy of the htmlheader.vm file, where you put the new doctype  \nsdumitriu - (14:32): 2) upload it as an attachment of the skin document  \nvmassol - (14:33): sdumitriu: right, either choice  \nbblfish - (14:33): the second sounds like I could add it to git, and make it easier to install...  \nvmassol - (14:33): http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/skin/templates/htmlheader.vm  \nvmassol - (14:34): the first one too  \nvmassol - (14:34): since you can export it as a XAR  \nvmassol - (14:34): it's the same  \nvmassol - (14:34): in term of exporting  \nvmassol - (14:34): what we're doing is simply having a page defining a skin as an object  \nvmassol - (14:34): so in essence a custom skin is simply a wiki page  \nvmassol - (14:35): and thus you can export it as a standard wiki page  \nvmassol - (14:35): and reimport is a standard wiki page too  \nvmassol - (14:35): s/is/it/  \nbblfish - (14:35): wgeb tiy say \"upload as an attachment of the skin document\", you mean I should attach that to http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/WebId/XWikiUserProfileSheet  \nvmassol - (14:35): no  \nvmassol - (14:35): you need to follow the steps I gave  \nbblfish - (14:35): ok  \nvmassol - (14:36): you can read the tutorial I gave  \nsdumitriu - (14:36): I really hate doctypes...  \nvmassol - (14:36): it has a lot more explanations  \nbblfish - (14:38): the doctypes are useful for automatic testing, but yes, they are a bit old hat  \nnuvolari left at 14:45 (Remote host closed the connection  \nsavi joined #xwiki at 14:53  \nsdumitriu - (14:54): I really don't understand why people want to stay to the SGML model...  \nsdumitriu - (14:54): XML+namespaces is the way to go  \nsdumitriu - (14:55): No need for custom doctypes every time you want to combine a new language in the HTML  \nsdumitriu - (14:55): Like, what doctype do you use if you want to have both RDFa and MathML in the same document?  \nnuvolari joined #xwiki at 14:56  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:59): I just found that the default schema is null, shouldn't it be the main wiki name?  \nsdumitriu - (14:59): Are you sure?  \nsdumitriu - (14:59): Doesn't Hibernate use the right name based on the config file?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:00): That's what the test showed, I hacked up HibernateStore but that shouldn't have caused it to be null.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:07): Just double checked on a clean copy (2.2.2) same deal.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:07): println(xcontext.getContext().getWiki().getHibernateStore().getConfiguration().getProperty(Environment.DEFAULT\\_SCHEMA));  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:07): returns null  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:08): Same for DEFAULT\\_CATALOG  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:10): What concerns me is that getSchemaUpdateScript( stores the schema, sets it to a subwiki name, then puts it back if the original is not null.
