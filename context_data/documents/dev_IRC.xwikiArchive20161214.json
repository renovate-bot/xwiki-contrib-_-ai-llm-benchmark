Could you ask the person (as I understand it's not you ?) that use that script to get back to us with the errors/problems they encounter. It might be simple to fix.  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: the problem is that there was no error when I last ran it. So someone will need to debug it I guess  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIR it's sdumitriu who wrote it but not sure  \n11:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:07\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, no error but only the first file has been uploaded  \n11:07\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0that's it ?  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're all uploaded, that's push\\_ow2  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that works fine  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but with update\\_ow2 only the first artifact get published  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the rest you need to go in the forge UI to publish the rest  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie select them in the combo box, specify the type of file, what os they target, and click add  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(step2 in the ui, for ex http://forge.ow2.org/project/admin/editrelease.php?group\\_id=170&release\\_id=5896&package\\_id=208 )  \n11:10\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, \u00a0so only the package \" # XE Windows installer\" is created succefully , for the remaining packages you have to do it manually with the ui, right ?  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIR the first one is xwiki-enterprise-installer-generic-8.4.2-standard.jar  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but indeed in the script it('s XE  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'm not fully sure which one gets published  \n11:12\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, and there is a /dev/null running on  \n11:12\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0yes it needs debugging  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: also would it be possible to remove old artifacts that still linger in that combox box?  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are old 6.4.8 artifacts in there  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that have been stuck for a long time now :)  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(2-3 years ;))  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0We could remove the /dev/null next time we do a release to check the error we get  \n11:17\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, those file sits in your $HOME/incoming ; can you get a shell to it ?  \n11:17\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0so you could remove those files  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying (I don't know if I have ssh access)  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going private with you  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks it worked! :)  \n11:31\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0you're welcome.  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:46\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n13:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n15:49\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n16:00\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:19\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:21\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:52\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:31\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:24\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:40\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:51\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:53\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:29\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n23:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit\n"}
