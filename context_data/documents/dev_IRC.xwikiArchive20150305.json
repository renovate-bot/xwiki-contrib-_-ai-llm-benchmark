 \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XWiki+Publication+Workflow+Application  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can cretae your own workflow  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by adding metadata to pages  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and then use script to search/list/etc based on those metadata)  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this is what this extension does in practice)  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so in summary  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if what you need is some strong workflow feature built in, xwiki is not for you  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0OTOH  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if what you need is a too to organize content and favor people's contribution and then on the side have some light workflow steps then XWiki is good for that  \n09:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0do you know of any enterprise grade open-source workflow systems that integrate well with xwiki ?  \n09:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i mean we will probably use xwiki anyway for normal documentation and wiki purposes  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Trefex: see http://www.xwiki.com/lang/en/XWikivsOtherSolutions/XWikivsDMS  \n09:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0but would be cool to have the workflow either linked or not in yet another system  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(re XWiki vs DMS)  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding integration there's nothing I know of that already exists so you'll need to perform that integration yourself.  \n09:42\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: thanks for the links  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I know is that some people have done that in the past with bonita  \n09:42\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0what do you mean by \"light\" integration in this case?
