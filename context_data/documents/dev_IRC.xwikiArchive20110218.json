 \n13:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0also, what i wondered about, when we use a url address for the image, will we still be able to use quality?  \n13:28\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:35\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm vmassol, i just realized that i prolly forgot a small thing for the 2.0 and 2.1 link syntax... right now i don't specify that the label might just as well be an image... should i add that to my patch on XE-839?  \n13:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0although it's already displayed in the table...  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: I think we said it can contain any wiki syntax, didn't we?  \n13:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yes we did. you are right then  \n13:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0my bad :)  \n13:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0jstoldt: 2.6.2 is half-released  \n13:40\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, i see, sdumitriu  \n13:40\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0are you doing 2.7.1 soon, too?

 \n13:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i could also provide you my files/ a patch for that, if you want me to  \n13:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0those would at least restore functionality, although they aren't particulary beautiful ;)  \n13:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: can't find it, probably was just a talk  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n13:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: re XWIKI-6003 I'd rather fire a xwiki:fullscreen:enter event (paired with the existing xwiki:fullscreen:entered ) and a xwiki:fullscreen:exit event (paired with xwiki:fullscreen:exited) , WDYT?  \n13:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and have my code in XWikiWysiwyg.js  \n13:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. save the selection enter/exit and restore it on entered/exited  \n13:49\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: +1  \n13:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0good  \n14:19\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0some core test are failing, see http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform-core/com.xpn.xwiki.platform$xwiki-core/6905/testReport/  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm probably caused by my changes of earlier this week  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n15:14\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, finally got the server  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: test fixed, hope it was the only one  \n15:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: ok  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok looking at including sections now  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm not extra happy about my \"hack\" for passing base references to WikiModel impl\u2026. but I couldn't find a better solution  \n15:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0did not looked yet  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0while you were away I sneaked a baseReference field in ResourceReference  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and now I've just modified it to be a List  \n15:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's a List to make easier to convert to EntityReference ?  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to resolve the reference in XWikiWikiModel  \n15:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other solution would have been to add a new method param in WikiModel calls  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/calls/methods/  \n15:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0needs to check the whole thing, don't understand exactly what is basereference  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just the storage of MetaData SOURCE values  \n15:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok i see  \n15:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0indeed it's not very clean that way  \n15:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we want to manipulate only strings in rendering-api  \n15:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0these strings have to be resolved in XWikiWikiModel  \n15:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to pass the info to XWikiWikiModel somehow  \n15:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i think i would have prefered a new parameter in WikiModel  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I hesitated and I found it not that bad to actually have that info inside the ResourceReference (that allowed me not to break the api too) but that wasn't my main motivation)  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: wdyt about adding a getXDOM() to DocumentModelBridge and modifying IncludeMacro to use getXDOM() instead of getContent() ?  \n15:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0make sense yes since includemacro does not really care how the content is really stored  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that'll help me too for include section  \n15:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0indeed  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I need your api to look for a section with a given id easily ;)  \n15:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0talk with checkstyle ;)  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n15:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0switch/case and cyclomatic complexity check is a explosive combo  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep but switch/case is usually a bit of an antipattern  \n15:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well it's quick :)  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not extensible)  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u2026 I need to clone the XDOM \u2026.  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when there's a tx)  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the alternative is to always clone in getXDOM() - safer but less performant)  \n16:09\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0finally ! in your face checkstyle  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe nice!  \n16:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0committed  \n16:38\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mflorea:  \n16:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0could you help me a bit?

 \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in this example)  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you do the same thing you do in your example  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I cannot do a new on it  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not an interface  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0except that you just call super.match instead of block instanceof HeaderBlock  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it does not reduce much as you can see, it's just a bit more logical  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes you can  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can do it on anything  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(AFAIK)  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway since I need to call super it doesn't help much indeed  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: can the user give an explicit id to a section?
