For example 2nd link from bottom is not broken. On the page it has dot at the end of the link (https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/sandbox/blob/master/authenticators/.), but it points to location without dot at the end (https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/sandbox/blob/master/authenticators/)  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0coud5: there's a dot at the end  \n16:59\u00a0<coud5>\u00a0ah, my bad link contains the \".\" too  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why it's invalid  \n16:59\u00a0<coud5>\u00a0chrome removes it  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the solution is to write:  \n16:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha this one is my fault  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[[url:<\u2026..>]].  \n16:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0funny that it works  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fixing it  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah strange, maybe the browser removes the dot at the end  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: or github redirect  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that would not be correct to remove the . so I hope the browser does not do it  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0. is perfectly valid in a URL  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I hover over in my browser with my mouse  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it gives a URL without the dot  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why I said it must be the browser  \n17:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n17:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:06\u00a0<eshan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<eshan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi btw broken links are only sent once every hour  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so after 1 hour they'll start being listed again if someone hits them  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to work on converting the old archives to the new format now  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you tested before I fix it ?  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still have it in my browser  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed FF seems to remove the . at the ends  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds weird  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(haven't refreshed yet)  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would need to check the spec  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the browser does not keep the . maybe we should not  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's a convenience feature only and not part of the spec  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but indeed we should check  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's not part of the spec that would make it a bug of the browser IMO  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would mean it's not supporting something valid  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah but since it saves everyone it's still interesting to have that for them  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the dot can be url -escaped if it's really needed I guess  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but I doubt we escape it for example when generating a URL with a . at the end of the page name for example  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that would make it not work  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm the wiki editor is completely broken on http://tuska.myxwiki.org  \n17:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the XAR is not up to date but editor is template stuff  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I can reproduce the same issue on several subwikis on myxwiki.org  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0restarting  \n17:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0myxwiki.org is real slow to restart...  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok done  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works now  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not good....  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to update it to 4.3M1 next week when it's released  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we still need a Release Manager for 4.3M1 guys...  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0!search Roster  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/BuildManagerRoster  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other one  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/ReleaseManagerRoster  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`, Denis, you should beef up your stats ;)  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: wikis on myxwiki.org have the blurred issue too  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: when we upgrade to 4.3M1 will it be fixed automatically?  \n17:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: sorry, it would have been with pleasure, but I do not have anytime available currently.

The solution to fix the blurring until the release is to define the button, menu and panels gradients in the ColorThemes  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually AndreasJonsson you haven't done any release yet right? :)  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: I'm not going to do that for 300 wikis\u2026 so if it's fixed automaitcally great ;)  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same for fmancinelli\u2026  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm we have autowatch on xwiki.org?  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't it be configured on a per user basis?  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(tmortagne)  \n17:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes but it's enabled by default  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see the UI to change it for my user  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0used to be in preferences  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: by default it's off now right?  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"it's enabled by default\"  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(i mean in default distribs)  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by default it's whatever is configured in conf file  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0# xwiki.plugin.watchlist.automaticwatch=major  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I thought we had agreed to have it off by default  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seems like someone removed it from the user profile  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha no  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0watchlist tab  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0watchlist  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm the ui looks broken here: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting?viewer=changes&rev1=44.1&rev2=45.1  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone knows why the livetable here doesn't display the creationDate: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/WebHome ?  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks like a bug  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no my bad  \n18:31\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need some help  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I cannot convert this doc IRC.xwikiArchive20100205  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I try to save modifications in it I get: \"Caused by: java.sql.BatchUpdateException: Data truncation: Data too long for column 'XWL\\_LINK' at row 1  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm so it would mean there's a link in the page that's longer than 255 chars  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I have found a workaround  \n18:53\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've cheated  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is actually a problem\u2026.  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we put IRC logs in page content, the parser will parse the whole content  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whereas in practice we only display them in a code macro  \n19:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok all archives converted: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/WebHome  \n19:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: ping  \n19:48\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Pong  \n19:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I transformed meta classes in components, and I choose to use as hint something like \"String\", \"StaticList\", and I updated the code to save this as the value of the classType XML field. Works fine, but there is one problem, it breaks the \"expectation\" of api.PropertyClass#getClassType and #getType  \n19:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the reason I choose to use \"String\" and not \"com.xpn.xwiki.objects.classes.StringClass\" is because I don't think it's good to have the impl class in the XML  \n19:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(ofc, I'm managing backwards compatibility with existing XARs by extracting the hint from the full class name)  \n19:54\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Right  \n19:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so my question is: should I keep the full Java class name as hint (and let it appear in XML) just to preserve the expectation of api.PropertyClass#getClassType and #getType or is it fine to break it?  \n19:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm thinking that the API user shouldn't care about the internal implementation of a property class  \n19:55\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I think that we should keep getClassType as it is  \n19:55\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But why do you say \"hint\"?  \n19:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0getClassType returns getClass().getName();  \n19:56\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0One more migration issue:  \n19:56\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0http://www.computer42.org/~dirk/tmp/www.computer42.org%20screen%20capture%202012-10-18-19-50-16.jpg  \n19:56\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0The LDAP-Applications claims to be installed but isn't shown below \"Applications\".  \n19:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: I changed that in classes.PropertyClass to return  \n19:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0StringUtils.removeEnd(getClass().getSimpleName(), \"Class\");  \n19:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0which I use as hint for a component that gives me the prop and its meta class  \n19:57\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The API has getType for that  \n19:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0again, there are two PropertyClass-es  \n19:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the api and the internal one  \n19:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the internal one has only getClassType, which used to return the full class name. I changed it to return the above, eg. \"String\", \"StaticList\", which I use as hint for my component  \n19:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and it works fine  \n20:00\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0The problem with the ldap application is fixed by uninstall & install the apllication  \n20:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0i.e. when you export a class you don't see anymore  \n20:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0<classType>com.xpn.xwiki.objects.classes.StringClass</classType>  \n20:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but  \n20:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0<classType>String</classType>  \n20:00\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, that should be good  \n20:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0where \"String\" is a hint used to get a new prop instance  \n20:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so far so good  \n20:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but  \n20:01\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I know that I've been using the class in a few places  \n20:01\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0(class editor)  \n20:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n20:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n20:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's how I found about the api.PropertyClass issue  \n20:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I noticed that the prop don't have the icons  \n20:02\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's used by $xwiki.getMetaclass  \n20:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0because api.PropertyClass#getClassType doesn't return anymore the full class name but the hint  \n20:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, indeed, but the argument passed to $xwiki.metaClass.get(...) is taken from api.PropertyClass#getClassType  \n20:03\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so it works  \n20:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0because MetaClass uses the given string as hint  \n20:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ofc, if you have code where the class type is hardcoded, like  \n20:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0$xwiki.metaclass.get('com.xpn...StringClass')  \n20:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it won't work  \n20:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so back to my question, its safer to use the full class name as hint (full backwards compatibility) but its uglier. I don't like that we include the impl class name in the XML  \n20:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I should send a mail  \n20:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:07\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0has quit  \n21:38\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:16\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:19\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:19\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan`>  \n22:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:44\u00a0<coud5>\u00a0has quit  \n22:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:02\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:14\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:15\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n23:15\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:41\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n23:42\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
