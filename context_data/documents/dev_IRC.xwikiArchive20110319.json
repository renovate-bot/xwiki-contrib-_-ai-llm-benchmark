I am interested in 'auto completion in content editors''  \n13:56\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I think the way it works is you write up a proposal and submit it to the gsoc page on xwiki.org  \n13:56\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:56\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0!search summer of code  \n13:56\u00a0<bark>\u00a0i just checking the project out. Se if i like the structure of it  \n13:57\u00a0<prapia>\u00a0ya i have done all that. I found very interested and very keen to work for XWiki, Where to post the proposal? How do I contact the mentor of that project?  \n13:57\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0If you have any questions about the system, I know far more than I rightfully should.  \n13:58\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n13:58\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it would be the student application form. Ofc I don't know that much about gsoc so I may well be feeding you a bunch of horse manure.  \n13:59\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0There are more developers around on week days so you might want to check back then.  \n13:59\u00a0<bark>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/student+application+form  \n14:01\u00a0<prapia>\u00a0Hey thank you very much. \u00a0@cjdelisle  \n14:03\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0A suniite, I'm just over the hill here in western MA  \n14:05\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:10\u00a0<harshanianu>\u00a0has quit  \n14:22\u00a0<harshanianu\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:34\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0[dirk] Is it possible to add a specific favicon to a space?  \n14:40\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:06\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:20\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:57\u00a0<harshanianu\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:36\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:00\u00a0<prapia>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has quit  \n20:18\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm I figured he was probably a decent user just confused about where to make pages, hence the comment.  \n20:21\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: hmm seems the registration page of xwiki.org got broken with the new registration impl you did  \n20:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it used to display a big warning message  \n20:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0explaining that you didn't need to register to test drive xwiki and was pointing to the playground  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was also explaning when you needed to register a uer  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0user  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see it anymore on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/register/XWiki/Register  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the message is wrong there: \"This will allow you to edit pages, once the admin gives you appropriate rights\" <\u2014 this is wrong  \n20:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how can we override this now? (I don't recall)  \n20:25\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I seem to recall it was just an edit to XWiki.Registration  \n20:26\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I also seem to recall we intended on making a change to the version that was distributed with XE but apparently I dropped the ball and now I can't remember what the correct wording was.  \n20:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: do you think you could fix the reg on xwiki.org to put back the info I mentioned? If you're busy I'll do it but later on (need to take care of my kids now)  \n20:27\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I'll look and see if what it said is somewhere. Were we planning on changing the wording in the one distributed in XE?  \n20:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes definitely, I didn't know it was wrong  \n20:28\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0If so I will make a note to bring it up on monday so we can decide on the wording and I can hopefully actually commit it this time.  \n20:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's very simple to change  \n20:28\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Well it would be a change to applicationResources.propseries (if we are to distribute something different with XE)  \n20:30\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0done. It was just a rollback  \n20:30\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0(x.org)  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll update it now the view source is in the menu  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what page is it?  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found it  \n20:32\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Were we planning on rewording the default registration page?  \n20:32\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Maybe I didn't understand properly or just imagined it.  \n20:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n20:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know but we should reword it  \n20:35\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok. making a note to bring it up next week.  \n20:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool to see xwiki.org and myxwiki.org in good shape :)  \n20:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok need to fix the build breakages I introduced in distribution-tests  \n20:41\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I brought in the beginnings of some storage tests. Other than wiki start time they are fast. Still need your help getting them to run multiple times with different configuration parameters. My usual method (just read the code) breaks down when working with junit and maven.  \n20:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes hadn't time to look at it  \n20:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to fix the build I broke before the monday release  \n21:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:19\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lots of stuff in guice 3.0: http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/Guice30  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw this reminds me that I need to find the time to explore generating jdiff reports for our releases  \n21:52\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm todo bring in jsr330. That's common to both guice and jsr229 IIRC. Also there are a lot of places where we could use providers.  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re jsr330 we\"ve voted to use it, just need some time to do it  \n22:02\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0IMO just bringing in the dependency is a good start. Also maybe I can find some time to patch ECM to accept @Inject as an alternative to @Requirement then we can start making new code which is at least nearly complient.  \n22:03\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0oh well, bed time for me  \n22:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nn  \n23:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:23\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:23\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n23:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:54\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
