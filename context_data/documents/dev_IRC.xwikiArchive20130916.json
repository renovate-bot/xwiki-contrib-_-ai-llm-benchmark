I'd like to upgrade myxwiki,org to 5.1 today. Do you remember what changes you made on xwiki.org to fix the memory issue after the 5.1 upgrade? I don  \n09:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't see it documented on http://main.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/UpgradesLog  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm let me check xwiki.org WEB-INF/lib dir  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I upgraded one jar  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not sure  \n09:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think it was related to code macro, the lib used for syntax coloring  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it was related to jython  \n09:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see xwiki-platform-rendering-macro-code-5.2-SNAPSHOT.jar  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you need to put a newer code macro jar  \n09:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll try with 5.2M2  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes should be fine  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0adding doc for xwiki.org  \n09:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n09:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: good morning  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: wait  \n09:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0?  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should upgrade myxwiki.org to 5.2M2  \n09:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I am starting to test the migrations you told me in the mail on devlist. From which version should I migrate to 5.2 ?  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's our test platform  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n09:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0there's no XEM 5.2M2 so I'm not sure how the upgrade will go..  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think  \n09:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'd like to wait for the QA team to do to migration tests  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guillaume is supposed to commit a small jar for that  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it's worth giving him 1 or 2 days and then install 5.2-SNAPSHOT with this jar on myxwiki.org  \n09:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, I don't think he made it for 5.2M2  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now there's no advantage to installing 5.1 there  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not in 5.2M2 for sure  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you install 5.1 now then we would need to install 5.2SNAP in a few days which is a pity IMO  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if we don't do it then we loose an opportunity  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could wait RC1 if you feel safer  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0RC1 is only 1 week away  \n09:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't really need XEM to upgrade myxwiki.org  \n09:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what used to be in XEM war is no all in XE war anyway  \n09:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/no/now/  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and there should be no workspace in subwikis on myxwiki.org  \n09:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, but we still need to upgrade the XE xar which has changed and the users have to upgrade their wikis  \n09:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we haven't tested much the migrations so it might still be good ot have sorin/manuel test some migrations first  \n09:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't think we should upgrade myxwiki.org before we do some local upgrade tests  \n09:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+1 to wait for at least 2 more days till sorin/manuel have made some migration tests  \n09:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if we can do this tests before RC1 then I'm fine with waiting for RC1, I'll do the upgrade  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan:  \n09:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the only thing wrong in M2 in theory is the <xwiki.extension.distribution.wikiui> which is org.xwiki.enterprise:xwiki-enterprise-ui-wiki and should be org.xwiki.enterprise:xwiki-enterprise-ui-common IMO  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan is starting today the tests  \n09:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for myxwiki.org  \n09:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: again, from which version should I test ?  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I'd say from 4.5.x  \n09:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0okay, thanks  \n09:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for a mix a workspace and standard wikis farm we need Guillaume changes  \n09:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I'll report here is something is not properly working  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks sburjan  \n09:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in the mean time I'll modify global.vm on myxwiki.org to add the menu UIX because the user that pinged me a few times for the upgrade wants to use the Menu App.  \n09:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but again, I can't guarantee that you won't run into trouble with upgrading myxwiki.org  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't worry we'll blame it on you anyway if it fails :)  \n09:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(kidding)  \n09:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I know you will :))  \n09:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so I'm gonna start with a 4.5.3 XEM WAR to a 5.2M2 XE WAR  \n09:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0let's see how it goes  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n09:37\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: should I use the option to upgrade all wikis ?  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I think so  \n10:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0guys, does anybody have any idea where can I modify a workspaces description from the UI ? I'm on 5.2M2  \n10:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0seems that wiki directory does not have an edit button in the livetable  \n10:15\u00a0<fm2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: any idea?  \n10:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: seems I have it from the Wiki Manager, but that is the old app afaik  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you can edit the descriptor ofc  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(XWikiServer\\*)  \n10:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Yes, it is on the Wiki Manager, but you had to install it  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I thought maybe there was a workspaces feature to do that  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so no specific workspaces feature?  \n10:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I only had wiki manager, because I was migrating from a Manager  \n10:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't think so  \n10:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\\*only = already  \n10:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok  \n10:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0only one bug so far :)  \n10:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it seems that after the migration, Lucene is STILL the selected search engine. It means that there is nothing overwritten by 5.1 so that SOLR to become the default. Is this normal ?  \n10:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: yes it's normal  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now is it good? that's another question ;)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically the choice is definedin a page SearchConfig  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that we don't provide  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's created when you use your wiki)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there's no upgrade of it  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the good part is that we don't magically change the config for the user  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the bad part is that the user may not be aware that there's a better search engine  \n10:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n11:39\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: how is the workspace template extension called in 5.2 ?  \n11:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0after the migration I see something like: XWiki Platform - Workspace - Template Features 5.1 .. and the install button  \n11:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am trying to understand if the template is 5.2M2 or it's 5.1. Footer says 5.2M2, but dunno if it's correct  \n11:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I didn't change its name  \n11:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I am currently watching why the DW is launched just after the creation of a wiki  \n12:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:11\u00a0<fm2>\u00a0has quit  \n12:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: that must be a bug  \n12:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it seems  \n12:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I have found some bugs on the homepage, but I think it's because the merging does not properly work  \n12:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0merging done by the dw  \n12:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sburjan: I have also reported http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9456  \n12:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: this only reproduces on a clean instance.
