 \n10:39\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0any idea if it will be delayed ?  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no indicator that it would but I guess it depends a lot on mflorea  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the app within minute core changes)  \n10:53\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n11:13\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:13\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyone knows why we add xwiki.work.dir=work in the xwiki.cfg file generated for XE?  \n12:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0seems pretty useless to me  \n12:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0any idea when xwiki.cfg will be fully migrated to xwiki.proprieties ?  \n12:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I mean.. are we slowly moving stuff on each release ?  \n12:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: it's not really that we moving stuff from xwiki.cfg to xwiki.properties but all that you can find in xwiki.cfg is related to oldcore/plugins and they will all be replaced by other systems with their own configuration that will go to xwiki.properties  \n12:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0as for the when, I would say a veeeeeeeeery long time  \n12:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yepp, the progress of getting rid of old-core is very slow  \n12:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0lot of code to be rewritten  \n12:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n12:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and not only they is also code that we keep like 1.0 syntax  \n12:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not very easy to get rid of this  \n12:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yepp. but that is in rendering, right ? not in old-core  \n12:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0make me think I need to check if there is some legacy code related stuff in xwiki.cfg to remove them  \n12:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: no  \n12:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we keep the old 1.0 syntax rendering system  \n13:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so 1.0 rendering is diffrent from xwiki-rendering from github \u00a0top level project  \n13:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what we have in rendering is just a converter from 1.0 to 2.0 syntax that is doing what it can two convert two thing that are really not working the same way  \n13:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/two/to/  \n13:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0old 1.0 rendering is on oldcore  \n13:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i see  \n13:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i think I was refering to the rendering project, the one independent with xwiki  \n13:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep this one only have a converter from 1.0 to 2.0 syntax implemented and rendering parser but there is still (and will always be) stuff hard to convert  \n13:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so if you want the proper 1.0 syntax behavior there is no other choice than using oldcore  \n13:27\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0dunno if it's already addressed but 3.1 thinks Chrome is Safari, i dunno maybe implication is webkit based = safari oder; At least that's what the editing pop-up scary sez  \n13:55\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n14:16\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:19\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:22\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:24\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:00\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: Hi  \n15:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0any idea why we have xwiki.work.dir=work in xwiki.cfg ?  \n15:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I mean what is the need ? I know how it ends up here ;)  \n15:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, is it commented or enabled?  \n15:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's added during XE build so it's enabled  \n15:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't see why XE if it's even useful  \n15:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's added using xwikiCfgAdditionalProperties  \n15:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0$xwikiCfgAdditionalProperties  \n15:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If you remove it, does it still work?  \n15:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Might be some legacy  \n15:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You could git blame to see who added that line  \n15:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I removed it from XEM since a long time AFAIK actually  \n15:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I actually removed it because I tough is was not in XE as far I a rememberbut seems I was wrong  \n15:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's pretty old AFAIK  \n15:08\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<Stulle|Workstati>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<xipe>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<Stulle|Workstati>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:09\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:09\u00a0<xipe>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:09\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Going to breakfast, bbl  \n15:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: I removed it from XE along with my refactoring, will see if someone complains  \n15:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:20\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:26\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:26\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:44\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:27\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:55\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:59\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n23:05\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:29\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
