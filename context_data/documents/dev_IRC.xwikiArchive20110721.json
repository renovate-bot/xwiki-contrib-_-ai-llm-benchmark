It makes sense because this page is a category but at the same time it has the category management code in its content.  \n08:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. first display the list of categories + the option to add a new category and then the list of blog posts from the current category, were the \"current\" category is the root of all categories  \n08:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. render first the Blog.Categories code (=> category management UI) and then the Blog.CategorySheet (=> because Blog.Categories has an object of type Blog.CategoryClass)  \n09:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, I'm not that fond of this solution  \n09:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Blog.Categories is supposed to be an invisible category  \n09:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But my question was:  \n09:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but right now BlogCategories is both a category and a category directory  \n09:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If the document explicitly mentions the sheet to use, shouldn't the sheet detection algorithm stop there?  \n09:12\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, that's the question. My current impl doesn't stop, i.e it returns both \"included\" and \"binded\" sheets, and I think there are cases when you want this behaviour  \n09:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Can you give an example?  \n09:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0thinking..  \n09:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I can't think of a real use case, with the pages from the default XAR. An included sheet could call other class sheets if it needs to (in this case, we can include BlogCategorySheet in BlogCategories code if we really want to display the list of blog posts after the list of categories) so I suppose there's no limitation if I stop when I find an \"included\" sheet.  \n09:24\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Let's do it like this for the moment  \n09:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n09:24\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0if we find a need to change it later, we'll see  \n09:31\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:01\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Can someone fill in the clirr report for 3.2M1?

 \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0and we have a current limitation  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0let me explain  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0in the annotation objects there's a target field  \n10:43\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0so it was the rename  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0which points to the page where the annotation should apply  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0this is because we allow annotations to be stored on different pages than where they apply  \n10:43\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0brb  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0ok waitin  \n10:43\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0Dan18: our limitation is when we copy or rename pages we don't currently update that field  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0if you check your annotations they target the XWiki space  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0so if you edit them manually and change XWiki. by Water. it'll work fine  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0the jira issue related to this is XWIKI-5203  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0so in a nutshell you hit that bug/limitation  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0and you can fix your annotations by editing the objects manually  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(FTM)  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(till we fix the issue)  \n10:45\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok, let me read this again  \n10:46\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0the target is a (fully qualified) page name?  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0yes  \n10:46\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0the same page where the annotations are included  \n10:47\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0so the rename didnt change the name of the root page  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0just added a comment to the issue if you want to refresh it  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0yes  \n10:48\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0yes, i was thinking about the default \"self\" also  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0indeed, we did a bit of overengineering here  \n10:49\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0btw, i had this thought this morning, but wasnt sure if its feasible  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0to support a use case that doesn't appear so often....  \n10:49\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i think this use case is probably common when you get started  \n10:49\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0then you dont have a clear idea of organization or even xwiki for that matter  \n10:50\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0so, i was thinking that the docment object is essentially textual  \n10:50\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0so annotations need a way to keep track of location in a relative way  \n10:51\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0(not sure how, perhaps by counting characters from the beginning, and then recalculating upon every change of text)  \n10:51\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0also, i imagine that non text elements such as images can not be annotated  \n10:52\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0(is this true?)  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0we keep track of location by storing context  \n10:52\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0what is context?  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0that's what the different object fields are for  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0check your annotation objects  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0you'll see what is stored for them  \n10:52\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i think i just saw the annotated text in a field  \n10:53\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0(i dont have the server running right now)  \n10:55\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0so, i was reminded of the introduction to the Gama et al design pattern book, where they describe how a text is stored in a word processor  \n10:55\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0its compositional, with light weight objects for characters and so forth  \n10:56\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0does this make sense in a wiki environment?  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0dunno, for annotation our algorithm is pretty powerful and support text changes  \n10:58\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0well, anyway, just a wild idea  \n10:58\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0with a more fine grained approach its possible to annotate any object embedded in a page, i guess that would be the main benefit  \n10:58\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0and perhaps cleaner algorithm for locating annotations  \n10:59\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0(or more straightforward, although i really dont know what the current algorithm is)  \n10:59\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0(so i am only making grand assumptions)  \n10:59\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0-- i am really glad you found the solution --  \n11:00\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0can i ask you another question.  \n11:01\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0how many objects are usually created in a good sized xwiki -- i am trying to get a sense for typical scale of a large (or every large) site  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0we can already annotation about everything  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0s/annotation/annotate/  \n11:02\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0re objects the only issue ATM is when you have too many in a single page  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0this they're all loaded when the page is loaded  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0so it takes time  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0apart from this there's no limitation  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0and too many means several hundreds  \n11:03\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0what is the main argument for having a scalable database  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0sorry got to work on my stuff a bit\u2026 that question would take us too far\u2026 scalable means performant. everybody wants performance  \n11:05\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i meant specifically in terms of number of objects  \n11:05\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0sure, i have this other idea, but want to check scalability needs first  \n11:06\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0lets talk some other time  \n11:06\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0many thanks for your help  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0np  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0so replace XWiki by Water in your objects and you'll that the annotations will work  \n11:06\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0thats great. thanks  \n11:17\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0-- to bad. The edit doesnt seem to work  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0Dan18: what edit?  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I did it locally and it works fine  \n11:17\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i updated the target, but the annotations dont show up  \n11:17\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0let me try again  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0you made a mistake  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0somewhere  \n11:17\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0yes, something is wrong  \n11:18\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i'll double check -- usually something so obvious i miss it  \n11:22\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok. i found it.  \n11:22\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0interesting  \n11:23\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0after changing all targets all annoations showed up at the bottom  \n11:23\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0however one annotation did not show up marked yellow in the text  \n11:24\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i then noticed that the selection text is a bit different (a dot too much), i had added a few more words to the sentence  \n11:24\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0so the period at the end of the sentence moved  \n11:24\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0and was included in the selection  \n11:24\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0removing the dot made the annotation appear again  \n11:25\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0how does the annotation know which phrase to highlight if identical text is highlighted in differnt locations -- perhaps some counting  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0no idea  \n11:31\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0is now known as <evalica>  \n11:37\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0has quit  \n12:09\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n12:46\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:55\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:49\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0how come we didn't release yest ?

 \n17:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0no other processing, just this  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0lucaa: to concatenate 2 files using maven you can use the AntRun plugin and use the ant task to do that  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/concat.html  \n17:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0that's a bit scratching the left year with the right hand...  \n17:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0anything simpler?  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0that's complicated?  \n17:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0actually no, it's simple enough  \n17:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well the usage of a second tool seems a little overhead  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0there's no ther solution anyway  \n17:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but it should be simple  \n17:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I was thinking about the assembly plugin...  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0hmmm  \n17:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but apparently doesn't do this  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I don't think it does this  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0it doesn't look into the content of files  \n17:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok, ant concat it will be then  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0maybe someone coded a plugin  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0smae question here: http://www.tikalk.com/alm/forums/maven-plugin-concatenation-resource-files-how  \n17:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I looked it up a bit but didn't find a straightfwd answer  \n17:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Does the antrun plugin actually run ant, or does it just use ant tasks calling them directly from Java?  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0there's this but sounds more complex to me :http://croche.googlecode.com/svn/docs/maven-merge-files-plugin/0.1/usage.html  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0sdumitriu: it calls ant but in embedded mode (java api)  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(as we do in xwiki for ex)  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0cool my jenkins fix worked for enterprise tests: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests/842/  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0that'll remove lots of false positives  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0now we need to check all configuration for all jobs  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0actually only enterrise rbanches for now  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I need to validate first that my github hook works  \n17:38\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0actually the merge file plugin seems pretty cute. Thanks  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0the painful part is that it's in another repo so you'll need to add it and then it means a lot of perf degradation when maven searches for artifacts  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(provided it works)  \n17:40\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes, I know. I'm oscillating. it has this great feature of allowing to add a separator between the concatenated files, like the name of the file to follow  \n17:40\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0which can prove very useful  \n17:41\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(i'm trying to do a hacky fasty concatenation of js & css default resources)  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0there are lots of ant tasks  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0for merging/concatenating  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0you can do the same with them and more  \n17:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0nop ant is not easy for me  \n17:46\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0too young for that :D  \n17:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\u00a0// TODO: Support syntax 1.0 \u00a0Wait no!
