looks like xwiki-platform-feed-api/ was expecting to get jtidy from oldcore  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(jenkins fail)  \n16:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks, I'll look into it  \n16:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:43\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:52\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0seems moving the translation keys for annotations from Platform.XWikiCoreResources to Platform.AnnotationCodeTranslations zeroed out a lot of translations in l10n.wiki.org  \n17:14\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0I am currently about to copy over the german translation but I wonder is that might be scriptable instead \\_  \n17:18\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: the keys are still in Platform.XWikiCoreResources, they have been copied and not moved AFAIK  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they are deprecated in Platform.XWikiCoreResources  \n17:21\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0tmortagne: I just noticed that in my local dev-instance the german translations are missing for the annotations, and l10n has two versions for every key  \n17:22\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0so I thought the duplicake keys there were the reason, but maybe it is something else  \n17:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as I said you have two version because the keys exists in both resources  \n17:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but the values have not been copied  \n17:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just the keys  \n17:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you don't need to copy them one by one or use a script, you can use batch import  \n17:24\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, I did not know about batch import  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it take list of key=value like in a document translation itself  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0( http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Platform/AnnotationCodeTranslations?action=batchimport&language=de )  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0l10n is still missing some automated copy when moving keys from one resource to another  \n17:25\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0and anyway, I see I have a manually created ApplicationResources\\_de.properties in my local dev instance, that explains a few things :-/  \n17:26\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but then, I guess it does not hurt to copy over the translations to the new keys, if the old ones are still in use but deprecated  \n17:27\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0anyway, thanks! \u00a0now I only need an export for the old key=value ... but that is just matter of copy & paste the HTML results and apply a simple sed script ;)  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: you should have them in an export of ApplicationResources\\_de.properties  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/L10NCode/GetTranslationFile?name=Platform.XWikiCoreResources&language=de&app=Platform&xpage=plain  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(deprecated keys are still exported in translations, they are just not listed in the translation form)  \n17:36\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, this works much better than screen scraping ;)  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea I guess :)  \n17:37\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n17:39\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0I wonder if I should update the other languages, too, as it is mostly export, copy & import, without understanding what it means ... but a few translation are already updates so I better leave them alone ...  \n17:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has left #xwiki
