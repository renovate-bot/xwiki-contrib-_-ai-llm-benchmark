Was busy. Meant to say I think arp based attacks have limited effectiveness because there will be a collision and it becomes obvious real quick.  \nspliffy - (16:26): yeah, np ;)  \ncjdelisle - (16:26): But if there is an arp vulnerability, that's better than an arp vulnerability, a dhcp vulnerability and a dns vulnerability.  \nspliffy - (16:29): for sure! but i think if you have measures to detect arp spoofing you can detect malicious dhcp servers too. ok, detection only allows you to react though.  \nspliffy - (16:29): but i get your point, ty  \ncjdelisle - (16:31): Didn't really know about arp spoofing. Not sure it would be very effective on a small network, the real node would respond too and the eth cards would panic.  \ncjdelisle - (16:32): or you send some data, the middleman takes it and so does the real node, both respond and tcp would bind up real quick.  \ncjdelisle - (16:33): I would put that in the \"unexploitable\" catagory with bios malware and most of what Joanna Rutkowska presents ;)  \nspliffy - (16:34): mh, i'm not sure. i tried it with the workstation of my boss and he didn't notice =)  \ncjdelisle - (16:34): You were able to rebind an ip address?  \nvmassol left at 16:34 (Quit: Leaving.  \nspliffy - (16:35): i don't really remember i did it a year ago, but now it's becoming more interesting at the company.  \nspliffy - (16:36): s/interesting/important/  \ncjdelisle - (16:36): So you fool a switch into desynchronizing a network?  \nspliffy - (16:37): IIRC i made his workstation think i'm the router and i spoofed the router to think i am his host  \nspliffy - (16:37): no, i didn't flood the switch  \nspliffy - (16:37): if you mean that  \nspliffy - (16:38): i didn't make its arp table overflow  \ncjdelisle - (16:38): no, I was thinking to desynchrinze the network so the other half thinks this half has different macs than they do.  \ncjdelisle - (16:39): You must have had 2 eth cards on the same subnet though.  \ncjdelisle - (16:39): Or did you use mac spoofing and spoof 2 mac addresses in the same eth card?  \nspliffy - (16:39): i've got to make a sketch =) to remember  \ncjdelisle - (16:42): ``A simple defense that only works for simple ARP spoofing attacks is the use of static IP-MAC mappings'' ip addr == last 2 bytes of ip addr == last 2 bytes of mac.  \ncjdelisle - (16:42): err s/ip addr == /  \nspliffy - (16:43): :P .. no got it  \ncjdelisle - (16:44): Actually arp/dns/dhcp are all null'd if you just run everything through public key ssh tunnels.  \nspliffy - (16:44): cjdelisle: to accomplish this you'd have to administer your arp cache manually  \nspliffy - (16:45): .. as i understand it  \ncjdelisle - (16:45): not really, just put up a box to complain if an arp message is sent where the mapping looks wrong.  \ncjdelisle - (16:47): Again though, I've never heard of anything getting ownd by arp attacks. Maybe effective at wowing the boss but not something I would put a lot of effort into.  \ncjdelisle - (16:49): I'd be far more worried about spear phishing attacks putting malware on workstations.  \nspliffy - (16:49): interesting. it's helped much to raise security awareness of my boss though ;)  \ncjdelisle - (16:49): ^^ pen testing does that :)  \nspliffy - (16:50): true, i imagine malware to be a bigger threat too  \nsburjan - (16:51): cjdelisle: wew you able to figure out why that attachment test is failing ?  \ncjdelisle - (16:51): vmassol was looking at that one, I think the conclusion was that it was selenium's fault.  \nevalica - (16:53): jvelociter: why can't I do something like <input type=\"text\" class=\"withTip suggestDocuments suggestUsers\"/> ? :P  \njvelociter - (16:54): evalica: it does not make sense  \njvelociter - (16:54): suggestUsers suggestGroups would  \njvelociter - (16:54): but it's quite complex  \nevalica - (16:54): I want to have something like in your demo for the intranet - to have suggest for all types of classes: pages, spaces, users, etc  \nevalica - (16:55): with the separator in between ....  \nsdumitriu - (16:56): That's the goal, but the implementation is not ready yet  \nsburjan - (16:57): cjdelisle: did itstarted to fail since we moved to newest selenium ?  \nevalica - (16:58): sdumitriu: the goal will integrate tags.js in ajaxSuggest too?  \ncjdelisle - (16:58): hmm good question. Unfortunately I spent the past few hours mining the logs looking for info about another test failure so you're welcome to try ;)  \nevalica - (16:59): sdumitriu: actually I was talking was of the suggest part - why is separated - but k  \nsburjan - (17:07): jvelociter: I am still getting nasty js errors on IE6 when I navigate within Administration Menu  \njvelociter - (17:08): evalica: yes, that's the next step, to have different types of results in the same query  \njvelociter - (17:08): sburjan: doing what steps exactly ?  \nsburjan - (17:09): login, go to admin page.
