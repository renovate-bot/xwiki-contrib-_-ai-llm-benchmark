The problematic macros are Spaces and Tags.. but that's probably because of the page's last author that shows up as the local admin.  \n12:25\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0seems that some pages on the xe template have XWiki.Admin as author instead of xwiki:XWiki.Admin  \n12:28\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:31\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: the solution for subwiki macro registration was to set xwiki:XWiki.Admin as author for XE pages requiring PR?  \n12:32\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0if so, then we did not get them all, since macros like Spaces and Tags are still problematic  \n13:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: I got them on main wiki page .. on Activity and Workspace macros.
