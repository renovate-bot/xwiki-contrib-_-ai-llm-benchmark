 \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so if you put several white space for example you will end up in html with \u00a0white space followed by as many &nbsp; as needed to have the same number of white spaces visually in your browser  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. not all white spaces are converted to &nbsp; but enough are so that you see them all in your browser  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the rule for most of the syntax, there is very specific places like before list syntax where the white spaces are not kept  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway just put several white space and see the result, best explanation :)  \n10:50\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0If I typing \"un espace\" in wiki editor I haven't a &nbsp; displayed between \"un\" and \"espace\"  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes, as I said you get &nbsp; only if you have several white spaces  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that you \"see\" all of them  \n10:53\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0haaa  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not all white space end up as unbreakable spaces  \n10:57\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0right. \"un \u00a0espace\" (with 2 blank) displayed \"un &nbsp;espace\" but I can not have \"un&nbsp;espace\"?  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since there is a UTF8 code for unbreakable space you can probably just insert one in the content  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0need to copy/paste it from somewhere or find how to write one with your keyboard  \n10:58\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes I didn't think about utf-8 character (I will test it)  \n11:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I copy/pasted it from http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a0/index.htm in http://tuska.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Test/WhiteSpace  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not seems to go trough  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the browser ends up with a simple white space from what I can see  \n11:03\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0(difficult to check if it is unbreakable space)  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I checked with a hex editor  \n11:16\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0If I look at your Whitespace page wih firebug (with displayed the entity in unicode): I see: <p>&#10;toto tyty&#10; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>  \n11:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually UTF8 is not required, looks like non breacking white space ascii code is 160 according to http://www.ascii-code.com/  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but then not sure how browser react to it  \n11:19\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0and with xwiki syntax I can write an ascii character?  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no code for ascii character no but I mean it should be supported by any encoding  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"just\" need to find some vistual keyboard or something to copy/paste  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in thgeory  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0theory  \n11:21\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok it is not simple \u00a0(because it is for normal user)  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes not simple  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess we could imagine some button in the WYSIWYG for this  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually maybe CKEditor have this already  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but then It's possible XWiki html parser convert $nbsp; to SpaceBlock internall which end up as white space  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which would probably deserve a bug on jira from \"real\" non breaking white spaces support point of view  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends what the XML parser used by XWiki html parser does when it hits $nbsp;  \n11:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0A nice way would be typing \" \u00a0\" 2 blank, to generate \"$nbsp;\"  \n11:27\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0The Ckeditor have a \"insert special character\" menu but didn't propose unbreakable space  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like <shift> + <space> is suposed to generate non breaking space on Windows from what I see on Google  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not work in Ubuntu it seems  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0<alt>+<space> on Mac from what I am told  \n11:31\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Our users have windows desktop, I must try this way (time to start another PC bc I'm under Debian)  \n11:45\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Nope! With win7 + xwiki editor, Maj Space doesn't work  \n11:54\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Ok I think I tell my user to use \"{{html}}&nbsp;{{/html}}\" bc the don't use this character frequently  \n12:01\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Ho another way, like you said with copy/paste form LibreOffice: \u00a0AltGr + Space and copy/paste to xwiki editor :)  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:50\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:41\u00a0<ImRG>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n18:33\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:57\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:19\u00a0<raphael29\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:22\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:28\u00a0<raphael29\\_>\u00a0has quit\n"}
