I want to ask you if it's used by some app/module. If not, we could move it out of the core and maybe remove it from the bundle. (it's only a suggestion)  \ncjdelisle - (15:15): Good day,  \ncjdelisle - (15:15): (enter next to shift) \u00a0\u00a0I think moving out the flickr plugin is a good idea.  \nlucaa - (15:15): me too  \njvdrean - (15:15): +1  \nlucaa - (15:16): I think the same, unless it's used somewhere  \nlucaa - (15:16): but I really doubt that  \ncjdelisle - (15:16): we could move it to the plugins section but I think it is better for that type of functionality to be handled on a application level  \ncjdelisle - (15:16): !search flickr  \nlucaa - (15:18): but what does the flickr plugin actually do?  \ncjdelisle - (15:18): hmm FlickrUserMacro. \u00a0\u00a0\"bundled with all the XWiki products by default.\"  \nlucaa - (15:19): so the plugin seems to be just a bridge to com.aetrion.flickr.Flickr  \nlucaa - (15:19): then we should remove this one too...  \nlucaa - (15:20): although it's a little hard...  \nqwebirc36274 joined #xwiki at 15:23  \nqwebirc36274 is now known as SiX-P4cK (d5f6ffbb@gateway/web/freenode/ip.213.246.255.187  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:23): hi  \ncjdelisle - (15:24): hu SiX-P4cK you're using the page on xwiki.org to access the chat?  \ncjdelisle - (15:25): Not much response to \"[proposal] add getDocumentURL to DocumentAccessBridge\" can someone take a look at it, I need it to move xwiki-crypto into the tree.  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:26): im using http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/IRC  \ncjdelisle - (15:26): Cool. it wasn't working yesterday, I guess freenode fixed it.  \nlucaa - (15:27): additionally, flickruser macro is not really really working  \nlucaa - (15:27): I would say the lib is outdated  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:27): someone already make class in xwiki?  \ncjdelisle - (15:28): I'm find-grepping for flickr, it doesn't look like the flickruser macro even uses the flickr plugin.  \nlucaa - (15:28): :)  \nlucaa - (15:28): ah yes it doesn't I think  \nlucaa - (15:28): lemme look at the impl  \ncjdelisle - (15:29): \"someone already make class in xwiki?\" yes I have made a few classes, what question do you have?  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:29): I make a new class with a property \"endusers\" of type List of Users.  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:29): In edit mode of a new object, I can see all user in the select box.  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:29): How to limit of a group of users named \"endusergroup\"?  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:30): i hope you undestand my question  \nlucaa - (15:30): SiX-P4cK: \u00a0you'd need to use the database list property and write the query to get the users yourself  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:31): ok cool its possible first good news  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:31): no link or sample or something?  \nlucaa - (15:33): cjdelisle: yes, it seems the flickruser thing doesn't really use flickr plugin  \ncjdelisle - (15:33): still find-grepping I'll be able to say if there is anything which uses it soon.  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:34): sample founded ^^ http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/DatabaseListProperties  \nlucaa - (15:36): SiX-P4cK: and then you should have http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/QueryGuide to help you around querying xwiki (with hsql)  \nlucaa - (15:36): s/hsql/hql/  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:36): yeah  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:36): xwiki bug  \nlucaa - (15:37): ?

 \nSiX-P4cK - (15:42): i try  \ncjdelisle - (15:42): It's reasonably easy.  \nsburjan - (15:42): ok. so what's new about the flickr stuff ? should I call a vote ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:43): sburjan: at least a proposal.  \ncjdelisle - (15:43): SiX-P4cK: Do you know any programming languages?  \nsburjan - (15:43): cjdelisle, \u00a0: proposal to remove it from core in the plugins area, or to remove it entirely ?  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:43): yeah usually i work in java/jsf/struts/gwt  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:44): i have install xwiki this morning thats why i syx  \ncjdelisle - (15:44): sburjan: I would be happiest to see it removed entirely since the plugin model is deprecated. still find-grepping for dependencies...  \nlucaa - (15:45): sburjan: move it to contrib dead or something, for example  \nsburjan - (15:45): okay, I'll wait until you confirm so I won't send an email to devs  \nlucaa - (15:45): contrib dead aka retired  \nlucaa - (15:46): give us the options in the mail, we'll vote for one or the other  \ncjdelisle - (15:46): SiX-P4cK: Is the script that you write required to run with limited permissions or can it run with full admin permission?  \nlucaa - (15:46): another option is to rewrite it nicely as a service and have it in core plugins still  \nlucaa - (15:46): or in contrib alive  \nlucaa - (15:46): a.k.a sandbox  \nsburjan - (15:47): okay. I'll start writing the mail. cjdelisle : if you find some references that is still being used, please tell me  \ncjdelisle - (15:47): ok.  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:47): i have a feature usefull if you want: when you delete a page in a space index, return to the space index after delete  \nlucaa - (15:47): u know it's part of the API, right? I mean even if it  \nlucaa - (15:48): it's not used \\_in xwiki\\_, it could be used by someone in the wild who will be very very sad panda on upgrade  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:51): cjdelisle: run with limited permission  \ncjdelisle - (15:52): Ok, then you will have to program in velocity.  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:52): i try tu do something to replace a collective excel page  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:53): as collective can be excel ^^  \ncjdelisle - (15:53): This will have you some information about our scripting interface: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \ncjdelisle - (15:53): If you know java then you basically know velocity.  \ncjdelisle - (15:54): http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html  \ncjdelisle - (15:55): Velocity has it's own commands but when you have an object, you can treat it just like a java object (call methods etc.)  \nSiX-P4cK - (15:59): thx  \ncjdelisle - (16:01): ping sdumitriu jvelo lucaa vmassol Anyone opposed to this? \"[proposal] add getDocumentURL to DocumentAccessBridge with boolean isFullURL to specify whether the url should be the external document url.\" \u00a0I would like to move crypto into the trunk today, this is holding it up.  \nsburjan - (16:01): cjdelisle, : found anything ?  \ncjdelisle - (16:02): sburjan: still find-grepping i'll have to mine the results after though.

By default, I'm wondering if there's no other way to do it, but I didn't look into it so I have no clue...  \ncjdelisle - (16:04): The other option is to use the equivilant getAttachmentUrl and regex the domain name from it and paste it into the document url D:  \nasrfel left at 16:06 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan - (16:12): sdumitriu, : are you around ?  \nsburjan left at 16:44 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \noanat left at 16:55 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu left at 16:59 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 17:34  \nflorinciu left at 17:37 (Client Quit  \ncjdelisle - (17:48): !who  \njbrBridge - (17:48): \\* members: Cindy Mitchell, Eduard Moraru, evalica, Ricardo Rodr&#xED;guez  \nabusenius - (18:06): argh, just spent an hour rebuilding xwiki back and forth because my changes in colibri were ignored just to find out that the web/standard/pm.xml specifies a wrong version...  \njvdrean - (18:09): fixing it, thanks for the catch  \nsdumitriu left at 18:12 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 18:14  \nabusenius - (18:14): jvdrean: could you also fix versions for other skins?  \njvdrean left at 18:17 (Quit: Leaving.  \nevalica left at 18:20 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \ntsziklay joined #xwiki at 18:37  \narkub left at 18:40 (Read error: Operation timed out  \nKermitTheFragger left at 18:42 (Quit: Leaving  \nsdumitriu left at 18:50 (Quit: Leaving.  \nabusenius left at 18:54 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 19:07  \nSiX-P4cK left at 19:26 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 19:41  \ncjdelisle - (19:45): abusenius: /\\*\\* Unique SHA1 OID.
