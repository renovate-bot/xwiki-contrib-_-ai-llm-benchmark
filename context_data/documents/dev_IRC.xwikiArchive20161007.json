BTW XWiki can act as an openid server (don't know if that helps you)  \n21:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I'm not an expert in xwiki ldap :)  \n21:29\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0vmassol: if my main site has other non xwiki webapps installed ten I probably need ldap as it is the only thing that all of those apps are guaranteed to support  \n21:30\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0vmassol: openid would require some coding.  \n21:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my guess is that what you ask doesn't exist in xwiki, it would need to be coded  \n21:33\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has quit  \n21:33\u00a0<Chris[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n21:33\u00a0<Craeckie[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n21:33\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n21:33\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0has quit  \n21:33\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:34\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0vmassol: would it be possible to code it internally as a xwiki page? is there any moment on document creation when user account is created where i get an unencrypted/unhashed password to save to ldap? if it would be possible then it would require less coding than adding things to more than one separate webapps  \n21:35\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0unless in general it is better to have separate accounts per webapp  \n21:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you'd \u00a0simply need to write an authenticator and have 2 steps in it: step 1 would be to save to LDAP and step 2 would be to save to the xwiki store  \n21:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication#HCustomAuthentication  \n21:37\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0vmassol: not necessarily. there is user creation, there is password changing, etc. unless it would also help?  \n21:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR for step2 you'd just piggy back on the standard authenticator  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you wouldn't need to write it)  \n21:38\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think this is how it's done to sync with LDAP for example  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could check how the ldap authenticator is coded  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I think it syncs users)  \n21:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in the autheticator that is)  \n21:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in case you're interested: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/ldap/tree/master/ldap-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/ldap  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\" creates XWiki users if they have never logged in before\"  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so on first log in, it does the sync  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could do the same  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on first login in xwiki you'd crate the user in LDAP  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*create  \n21:40\u00a0<Craeckie[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:40\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(code is here: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/ldap/blob/master/ldap-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/ldap/XWikiLDAPAuthServiceImpl.java )  \n21:40\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0vmassol: here it is the other direction. so if I would change user's password it would have an effect on first login after this, and that is bad  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you've reached the end of my level of knowledge of authenticators in xwiki :)  \n21:42\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0same like registering the user would not create anything on ldap until first login  \n21:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could come back on Monday and I'm sure others might help you. Or you could ask on the mailing list  \n21:42\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0vmassol: I have checked the authenticator interface thing, it really only authenticates.  \n21:42\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0so, still, not sure what about things like document created event?  \n21:44\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0because this place would actually be quite nice for that purpose. sync on user created, sync on user modify sync on user delete. no ldap authenticatiion on login would be needed, but in any case I could in addition sync on login with a real authenticator  \n21:45\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0but this would only be needed if there would be a desync  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are document events in XWiki indeed: doc created, modified, object added modified, etc  \n21:47\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0vmassol: yes. the thing is if you get a cleartext passwor there, or a hash?  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hash\n"}
