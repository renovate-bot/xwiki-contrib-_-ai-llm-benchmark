If I modify the syntax for links in HTML comments, does it impact the wysiwyg code?  \nvmassol1 - (14:28): basically we now have 2 xwiki syntaxes: 2.0 and 2.1  \nvmassol1 - (14:28): and I'd like to use xwiki syntax 2.1 for html comments for links  \nvmassol1 - (14:28): is it transparent for you?  \nmflorea - (14:30): it should be transparent, I'm extracting the string reference from the comment and send it to the server (i.e. rendering module) to parse it and give me the targeted entity (e.g. document)  \nmflorea - (14:30): but let me check  \nvmassol1 - (14:30): ok thanks  \nmflorea - (14:40): I'm taking the string after \"startwikilink:\" and sent it to the server for parsing. I'm looking just if this string starts with \"mailto:\" or \"attach:\" to be able to know what dialog to display. If you're not going to change this then the editor will still work  \nvmassol1 - (14:41): ok thanks. I won't change this but you'll now be able to get that info from Link.getType() in the future  \nmflorea - (14:43): yes, but to get Link.getType() I have to send the reference to the server first.
