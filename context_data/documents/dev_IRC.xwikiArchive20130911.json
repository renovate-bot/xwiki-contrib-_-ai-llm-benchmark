I have a snapshot from yesterday  \n11:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: \u00a0I have an issue which I think is related to XWIKI-9402: on the ColorThemes.WebHome page the names are correctly displayed, but on the Presentation administration page the drop-down list has 4 elements, but they are all empty  \n11:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it seems the last snapshop don't have the last modifications because xwiki-platform does not build on CI  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes the build is a mess :(  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: I fixed that one some time ago AFAIK  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it looks like 9402  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check locally  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch indeed, same locally :(  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll debug  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I'm done with search suggest for M2.

If not, I'll debug it at the code level  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually the problem can be seen on http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/ColorThemes/Dusk for example  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the title doesn't display in the breadcrumb either  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even though it's set in the page  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I have an idea  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's probably because the class sheet has some content  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and for some reason the doc title is not used an the class sheet title is used  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that normal/expected?  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(lunch time, bbl)  \n13:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: should be fine now. lunch for me too  \n13:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0back  \n13:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I have a question about the email you sent earlier about stopping the release of Manager. If we remove manager, will the users be able to create subwikis ? I am not referring to workspaces, but the old subwiki system  \n13:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the one which has its own users, not using global users like workspaces does  \n13:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Yes, if he manually install \"wiki manager\" through the extension manager  \n13:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Ok, I see  \n13:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am 100% sure users will be confused about this change  \n13:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: Pong  \n13:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: I made a change to ObjectAdd action and I was wondering if you're ok with it  \n13:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Let me check  \n13:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's a bit hackish but it's very useful  \n13:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The xobjectNumber xredirect one?  \n13:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Looks good  \n13:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n13:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I remember having another hack for that, though  \n13:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Somewhere in a template  \n13:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sburjan: actually, manager was already bundled by Workspace  \n13:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0-by+with  \n13:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I needed a way to know which object was added  \n13:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't remember where, though  \n13:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But yeah, it's good  \n13:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually  \n13:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The trigger syntax is \"xobjectNumber=\" or \"xobjectNumber\"  \n13:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Is that clear enough?  \n13:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think so  \n13:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Should we use a verb instead, like \"&returnXObjectNumber=1\"?  \n13:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sburjan: actually, Workspace was bundled on XWiki Manager, and the user already had to go in the \"WikiManager\" space to create old-subwiki  \n13:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sburjan: now, there is just one step more: installing Wiki Manager UI  \n13:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: so will the user still be able to do so out of the box ?  \n13:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I see  \n13:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: well, as you can see I insert the object number as the value of that param  \n13:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so the redirect URL will have in returnXObjectNumber=3  \n13:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in the end  \n13:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sburjan: and in 5.3, the goal is to easily handle the 2 use-cases by default  \n13:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not sure this is more clear, at least for the code that will handle the parameter  \n13:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(e.g. $request.returnXObjectNumber)  \n13:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sburjan: so the 5.2 is an intermediary \u00a0solution  \n13:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0(due to lack of time)  \n13:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: okay, thanks. I'll have more questions tomorrow when I will test :)  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks mflorea for fixing the color theme issue  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can I close the issue now?  \n13:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok great  \n13:52\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: No, since we replace it, we can put xobjectNumber in the new URL  \n13:52\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So replace requestXObjectNumber=1|true|<nothing> with xobjectNumber=nr  \n13:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ah, indeed  \n13:53\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But that changes the URL even more  \n13:53\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Not sure which is better  \n13:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:58\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:03\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n16:20\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:27\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0gdelhumeau: did you force the lock on release notes page?

When writing an authenticator which methods have to be overridden from XWikiAuthServiceImpl? checkAuth, authenticate or both?  \n17:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: anything left to commit? I want to know if I can start the maven release this evening.  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: many things to commits but nothing blocker for the release, don't worry about me  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: it depends  \n17:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, so hold your commits until after the release :)  \n17:12\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0tmortagne: on what? :)  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: shouldn't we fix the build first?  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: sure  \n17:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: ofc, but first no commits  \n17:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: checkAuth is mostly for SSO authenticators  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0except to fix the build ;)  \n17:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n17:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but the build is going in the right direction  \n17:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: others that basically wait for someone to use the login screen with override authenticate  \n17:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if you look only at the master jobs  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/with/will/  \n17:15\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0tmortagne: not sure I've understood. Anyway what I want to do is the following: check the request session if there are some values. If they are there then go ahead and proceed as if the user is authenticated. If they are not there then return null (no authentication)  \n17:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: what about http://jira.xwiki.org/issues/?jql=Project%20in%20%28%22XWiki%20Commons%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Rendering%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Platform%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Enterprise%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Enterprise%20Manager%22%29%20and%20fixVersion%20in%20%28%225.2-milestone-2%22%29%20and%20resolution%20in%20%28%22Unresolved%22%29 ?  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: so that's an SSO and you need to override checkAuth  \n17:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0gdelhumeau: don't forget about http://jira.xwiki.org/issues/?jql=Project%20in%20%28%22XWiki%20Commons%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Rendering%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Platform%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Enterprise%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Enterprise%20Manager%22%29%20and%20fixVersion%20in%20%28%225.2-milestone-2%22%29%20and%20resolution%20in%20%28%22Fixed%22%29%20and%20%28%28Documentation%20is%20EMPTY%29%20or%20%28%22Documentation%20in%20Release%20Notes%22%20is%20EMPTY%29%29  \n17:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(missing documentation)  \n17:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0maybe they just need to be updated  \n17:17\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0tmortagne: oh I understand. Ok thanks.  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: authrnticate is more or less what the standard authenticators (form/basic) are calling but you are skipping those  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: updated  \n17:19\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0great, thanks!  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: best is generally to look at existing authenticator for the one that is the closed from XWiki point of view  \n17:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: in your case probably something like https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/sandbox/tree/master/authenticators/xwiki-authentication-headers  \n17:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0most of the authenticators in https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/sandbox/tree/master/authenticators are SSO authenticators  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you also have AppServerTrustedAuthServiceImpl in oldcore itself  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0can hardly thing of a simpler authenticator  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0think  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/162  \n17:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0about the HTML validation breakage  \n17:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0merged, thanks!  \n17:51\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:04\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: commented on https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e587df14cf22110f299f261dcf46c654c34a9053  \n18:09\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:11\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: more detailed comment  \n18:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:13\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have to go  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0good evening  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n18:46\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:22\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:44\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:06\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:39\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:41\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit\n"}
