I am using v 1.5 but I haven't actually seen the problem myself, I just have the page that he printed  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:04): so I guess we still have a problem with this  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:05): newboy: printing after clicking on \"print preview\" should do the trick  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:05): I will check now for myself and let you know  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:11): jvdrean: I assume you mean clicking print on the browser after clicking \u00a0print preview on the page?  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:11): fyi: I checked for myself and the print fails as earlier discussed  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:12): newboy: yes  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:12): is there a way to disable that print functionality but leave print preview and the various exports?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:12): newboy: does it fail in both cases ?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:12): newboy: I'll fix this asap and ship it with XE 1.5.1  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:13): (which will be released in a couple of weeks)  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:14): I assume the print preview button will work, I'll just check now  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:16): jvdrean: yes, the print preview prints but as you say there are a few minor problems. i.e. it doesn't quite render the text sizes as it should  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:16): jvdrean: anyway, is there a way to disable the print option  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:17): newboy: you can edit templates/menuview.vm  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:20): jvdrean: just remove the line #submenuitem(\"javascript:window.print()\" $msg.get(\"core.menu.print\"))?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:20): yes and you'll also need to change the first menu item I think  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:22): jvdrean: if I change that to:#xwikitopmenuentrystart($doc.getURL(\"view\", \"xpage=print&amp;$docvariant\") $msg.get(\"core.menu.preview\"))?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:23): ah no  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:23): yeah, certainly not?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:24): looks like the top menu entry points to the preview  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:24): so, I didn't need to change it?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 12:25): nop  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:27): lol, ruined it now, if I look in the previous version and get that line is it likely to have changed?  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:27): the idea of keeping different versions of a file in case I ruin it obviously hasn't reached me yet  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 12:28): jvdrean: no, I defineltly need to change it  \nxwikibot - (06/08/2008 12:38): Community.CodeStyle was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvelociter (Updated links to files in SVN after repo reorganization) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/CodeStyle  \nxwikibot - (06/08/2008 12:45): Community.CodeStyle was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvelociter (Corrected path to zipexplorer files) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/CodeStyle  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 13:15): I asked a question yesterday but didn't get an answer. I have an issue for panels which use commands which require programming rights. The panels can only use the programming rights commands if the page that is currently being viewed has last been edited by a user with programming rights irrespective of the current user. Is there any way around this?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 14:54): newboy: yes this is a known issue of the panel app  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 14:55): jvdrean: no work around known?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 14:55): newboy: possible workaround > put the privileged code in another page and include it from the panel  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 14:55): newboy: it should do the trick  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 14:55): ok, sound like it would work. include is just a macro, correct?  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 14:56): yes, #includeInContext(\"Space.Page\")  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 14:56): for example  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 14:56): great, thank you  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 15:01): jvdrean: yes that works well, thank you again  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 16:08): jvdrean: I have to make my wiki with the assumption that the user will be as destructive as possible but should never see an error page. I think I nearly have everything sufficiently controlled. Except I want the user to be able to edit their own user page, change passowrd etc. But when I give them the edit right it also means that they can rename the page which would result in an error  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 16:09): is there anyway to allow them to edit but not rename? I suppose I could write some code in the template to remove the rename button for certain users but to be honest I would rather not as I feel that kind of editing will lead to complications in the future  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 16:12): hum, I don't know what you can do for this  \njvdrean - (06/08/2008 16:12): you should send an email on the list  \nnewboy - (06/08/2008 16:13): ok, I will do  \nxwikibot - (06/08/2008 16:50): XWiki.mardju was modified by XWiki.mardju (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/mardju  \nxwikibot - (06/08/2008 16:50): XWiki.mardju was modified by XWiki.mardju (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/mardju  \nxwikibot - (06/08/2008 17:35): Design.ImproveWikiAdministration was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvdrean - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/ImproveWikiAdministration  \nxwikibot - (06/08/2008 20:08): XWiki.Neustradamus was modified by XWiki.Neustradamus - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Neustradamus  \nxwikibot - (06/08/2008 20:08): XWiki.Neustradamus was modified by XWiki.Neustradamus - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Neustradamus  \n\n"}
