\n11:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0WikiEditorTest#testLinkButton  \n11:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and I have this line:  \n11:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0textArea.sendKeys(\"b\", Keys.ENTER, \"c\", Keys.ARROW\\_LEFT, Keys.ARROW\\_LEFT);  \n11:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the Keys.ENTER seems to not work, it does not create a new line  \n11:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it does not seem related to flamingo  \n11:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0do you have any idea?  \n11:31\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no if it were the wysiwyg editor I would have had some idea but the wiki editor should work fine  \n11:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0maybe it comes from my machine?  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdym?  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it were the wysiwyg editor and you were using a mac then yes :)  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(because of some known issue)  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you're not on mac AFAIK  \n11:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0nope  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I almost deleted that page seen its name! :)  \n11:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I've fixed it locally by puttin Keys.RETURN instead of Keys.ENETER  \n11:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*ENTER  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm make sure it works for all platforms  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since you might have broken the test on other platforms :)  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it pass on ci?  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with RETURN)  \n11:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes, I need to know what exactly this change means  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could check on mac later on if you wish (need to go for 10 minutes now)  \n11:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0on ci, I can't tell, it does not execute the test since xwiki-platfrom is broken  \n11:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I start a build anyway, let see  \n11:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0maybe it's only me  \n11:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0there is no reason to have this bug now and not earlier  \n11:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: Failed tests:  \n11:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0All tests passed  \n11:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0[INFO]

as a failure  \n11:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0is it related to the recent jenkins update?  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's normal  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0GD asked the same question yesterday  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some tests failed  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually no it's different here since it's red  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it failed here: http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Platform/job/xwiki-platform/5944/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-web/  \n11:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: why is it normal?

that script myself  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it just means that the error that happened are not false postiives  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hence the mail was sent  \n11:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: please explain this http://hastebin.com/iwaxusuyaz.php  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my best guess is that jenkins checks the logs at the end for any [ERROR]  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and yes it's possible that the jasmine tests had been fialing a while ago (we can test this by checking out some older tags)  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that jenkins improved the verification recently  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why it wasn't reported before  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not normal that the jasmine plugin doesn't stop the build BTW on error)  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're using jasmine-maven-plugin:1.0.2-beta-5  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see if there's a newer version  \n11:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0[INFO] ---

to 1.3.1.5  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying  \n11:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0see my reply on the mailing list (the link I gave)  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that guy says \"I have tried a variety of different 'plugin' versions, but currently using 1.532.3.\"  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but please go ahead and try with the latest stable  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01.532 is not a jasmin maven plugin vesion :)  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(I`m not familiar with jasmine)  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, that looks odd  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it looks like a jenkins version  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah, might be it  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR locally I get:  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Aug 21, 2014 11:57:16 AM com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.javascript.host.Document

\n11:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0regardless of that error  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I said above: \"(it's not normal that the jasmine plugin doesn't stop the build BTW on error)\"  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but hey that's an old version of jasmine and they've probabyl fixed it  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just give me 5 mn :)  \n12:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are now 11 SEVERE errors :)  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/1846ba508cad6ba6cd8a/raw/c0b1e785fa7108efe5eface9ad9fcb09b598ce4b/gistfile1.txt  \n12:03\u00a0<Lyes2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still I'm going to upgrade to it to see what happens on CI  \n12:04\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our current version is too old anyway  \n12:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: check this out https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14749  \n12:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0they fixed it by silencing the HTMLUnit logger :)  \n12:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since prototype.js intentionally catches that exception and silences it, but the HTMLUnit logger seems to not care about that and log it anyway  \n12:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this is their commit https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/84d49ceef2d68eebc9854800693d385c104752ba  \n12:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0though it seems to be a temporary fix  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's easy to \"fix\" I think  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying something  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: the initial error seems to be really old http://t113483.web-wiki-xwiki-scm.wikitalk.us/build-failed-in-jenkins-xwiki-platform-833-t113483.html :)  \n12:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0as you said, the jenkins update got a bit more strict  \n12:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but it was there before  \n12:28\u00a0<Guest59482>\u00a0has quit  \n12:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0brb, lunch  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0platform build issue should been fixed now )  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0brb lunch too!\u00e8  \n13:27\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n13:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0back  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so you applied the same trick to silence the logs :P  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I just hope we won`t silence important stuff like test failure details  \n14:00\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:03\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: yes, as mentioned in my commit an improvement would be to log in a file in target/ but I couldn't easily find how to do it  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I tried using a logback.xml file in test/resources and using a logback jar)  \n14:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok platform builds successfully now :)  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only 25 more jobs to fix :)
