So I then checked inside the table xwikiattachment, edited one of the fields and committed the change using dbedit. Strange thing occurred yet again, all the rest of the fields in the table disappeared and the field that i edited was the only one remaining... not sure what ha  \n02:15\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0personally, im used to mySQL, but happy to work with HSQL if i can understand it better..  \n02:17\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0do you have a wiki with pages or are you just testing right now?  \n02:17\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0wiki with pages, starting to build it up. why?  \n02:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You should never edit the database directly  \n02:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And after changing attachments from DB to filesystem, you should run the attachment porter (right cjd?)  \n02:18\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0ohhh..  \n02:18\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0correct  \n02:18\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0where abouts can i find the attachment porter?  \n02:18\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Filesystem+Attachment+Porter  \n02:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's normal that the logo went missing, it was stored in the database, and when you change the storage, existing attachments don't transfer themselves automatically  \n02:18\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0I guess i could set up a new xwiki and bring the content over one by one again  \n02:19\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0bugger :/  \n02:19\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0if you were just starting out, I would suggest beginning again with FS attachments turned on from the start rather than using the porter.  \n02:19\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0As it is, you have to use the porter.  \n02:22\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0Okay, im just reading at step 3  \n02:22\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0copy attachments from database  \n02:23\u00a0<qwebirc6325>\u00a0im probably going to start again, but just so i know.
