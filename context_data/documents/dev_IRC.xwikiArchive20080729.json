Create a page that uses a request parameter and just submit your form to that page!  \nnewboy\\_ - (29/07/2008 16:50): lucaa: that sounds as though it would work, are there any code snippets, etc. online that I could look at to see how to implement it?  \nvmassol - (29/07/2008 16:50): amelentev: thanks for the catch :)  \nnewboy - (29/07/2008 16:51): sorry, lost connection  \nlucaa - (29/07/2008 16:57): newboy: say your select's name in your form is \"choice\". make <form action=\"${xwiki.getURL(\"MySpace.MyParametrizedPage\")}\" method=\"get\" to have your form submitted to the MySpace.MyParametrizedPage.
