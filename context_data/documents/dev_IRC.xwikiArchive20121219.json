 \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: what's your worry?  \n12:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0IMO one is about the code bundled in XWiki, other is about the infrastructure aspect  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XALOCALIZATION is about l10n.xwiki.org  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not code  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0code is XWIKI in \"internationalization\" component  \n12:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I agree, l10n is part of infra, but there is 2 aspects: one is the actual server that hosts l10n, and other is the software component (translations)  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again anything related to code for i18n is in the XWiki platform jira  \n12:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, but adding translations values to a already existing key isn't supposed to be reported on XLOCALIZATION ?  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0adding translations is l10n  \n12:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0When you need a new key you report it on XWIKI, then you need a key translated to other language you report it to XALOCALIZATION  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0adding new keys is XWIKI Platform  \n12:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0exactly  \n12:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but I'm not talking about adding new key, I am talking about adding values for other languages to an existing key  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically exporting l10n content to the code should be an XWIKI platform issue  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exceptwe don't explicitly create those issues since we do this all the time as part of the release process  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0creating new translations is l10n  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n12:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, I know. My only fear is that users will be confused about this. Creating a project on XINFRA to add new values for other languages doesn't make much logic (at least for me)  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0users don't need to create issues to create new translations  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they shouldn't create any issue  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0!!!!  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would they need to?  \n12:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0because maybe they don't know how to add values on l10n  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you say they should use jira as a chat tool? :)  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they can if they want but it's not the right chat tool  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mailing lists and IRC are better  \n12:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well for example I reported some issues on XALOCALIZATION :)  \n12:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0asking devs or somebody to add some french keys  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's ok you can  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you still can  \n12:21\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8549 this issue doesn't have an assignee  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks fixed  \n12:48\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8462 this issue still reproduces on 4.3.1/ie8  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: the comment is for you: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8462  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: just learnt that you'll be on holiday soon (when?).

 \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: I think the user must be the same as the schema name yes  \n16:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, thanks. gonna create username workspacetemplate  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should have been created by XWiki  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are not supposed to create users by hand  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I tough you were asking for the main wiki  \n16:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: well, oracle creates users, not databases.  \n16:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: Maine wiki works, WorkspacesManage/Install fails  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it's a bug  \n16:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0this is how I create the stuff on Oracle:  \n16:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0grant all privileges to xwiki;  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: in oracle you get a shema with the user (it's not databases)  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the main wiki is stored in the xwiki schema  \n16:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n16:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but does XWiki know that on oracle you have to create a schema for the user instead of creating a database (like on MySQL) ? that's the question  \n16:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gonna try with a 4.1.4  \n16:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0because  \n16:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0wait for it...  \n16:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Oracle only supports one database per cluser  \n16:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*cluster  \n16:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I don;t even know if I have a cluster :)  \n16:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but I want to know if this sould be reported or not  \n16:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0maybe I'm using the wrong word but in postgresspeak, cluster means the actual db server  \n16:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: XWiki use a special code when creating wiki for Oracle  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's supposed to be done properly  \n16:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok. checking on 4.1.4  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and that code did not changed in a while  \n16:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It (tries to) do the same thing on postgres but there's a weird case where selects end up selecting over all schemas instead of just the one you want and it blows up  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if (DatabaseProduct.ORACLE == databaseProduct) {\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stmt.execute(\"create user \" + escapedSchema + \" identified by \" + escapedSchema);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stmt.execute(\"grant resource to \" + escapedSchema);  \n16:30\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, 4.1.4 is also affected  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0https://gist.github.com/4337520  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is what XWiki does  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it seems to be pretty aware :)  \n16:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0cool. thanks for the code :)  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and this code is very old  \n16:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so I should report this as a blocker ?  \n16:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0let me create a subwiki instead of installing workspaces  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: we officially support Oracle, something standard does not work on Oracle so that sounds pretty blocker yes  \n16:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: creating a Workspace works :)) so I might not have a cleaned oracle.  \n16:35\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0let me start from 0 and make sure I don't have a workspace user/schema  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: wiki manager is not supposed to care much if the database/schema already exists or not and workspaces is supposed to use wiki manager  \n16:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so user workspace template should \\_NOT\\_ be created apriori. I see  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand what you mean  \n16:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so user workspace template should \\_NOT\\_ be created by the user manually. I will ensure it does not already exists from an older test  \n16:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: why would the user create it ?  \n16:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and again as I said wiki manager is supposed to support the fact that a schema already exists  \n16:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that should not break it  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but maybe workspaces changed something  \n16:42\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I know for a fact that this does not happen on WOrkspace, because I always get a stracktrace when workspace template already exists from a previous instalation  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: getting a stack trace does not mean it failed  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wiki manager indicate that it could not create the database and assume it's because it's already there  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and continue  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it appear only in the log  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so what do you get exactly ?  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you get an error in the UI ?  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or just some log ?  \n16:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, I had a previous workspacetemplate user before, this is why I got the stack. Everything is ok now  \n16:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so false alarm regarding Oracle  \n16:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n16:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0my clearing script was not \"complete\" it did not dropped the workspacestemplate user schem, so I had an older  \n16:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XEM-238 :(  \n16:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0as me http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XEM-237  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you sure you don't have them in XE ?  \n17:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I only tested XEM  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XEM does not trigger any dependency anymore except the plugin themself  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I don't understand how XEM could have them and not XE  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also I don't have the duplicate ini 4.4 snapshot  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0on rome  \n17:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: I just looked at XE war and the jdom duplicate is there actually so it does not come from XEM  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't understand why there iis a difference between 4.4 and 4.3.1 for rome, I tested on 4.4 and just did a cherry pick  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like the cherry-pick was not complete for rome  \n17:14\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n17:24\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: we have this flicker http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-search-lucene/3071/testReport/junit/com.xpn.xwiki.plugin.lucene/IndexUpdaterTest/testIndexUpdater/ from time to time, can you take a look when you have some time please?  \n19:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: I think I saw this once before.
