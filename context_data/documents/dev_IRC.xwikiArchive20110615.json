Is there a special way to save document from code and avoid the watchlist ?  \n15:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: yes you can save document diretly using storage api instead of XWiki  \n15:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0unless you still need events for other reasons  \n15:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure but this require PR  \n15:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0you can't opt out of watching a document when you save it?  \n15:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n15:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: you can also simply disable autowatch  \n15:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you just need right to modify your profile for that  \n15:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0yes, my point is about existing wiki and discovering the way we have discovered the new feature  \n15:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If it's on by default, I think more people are going to discover it in a bad way than people discover it in a good way.  \n15:52\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:54\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0cjdelisle: maybe, it should be off, and setup on in the configuration file. A user migrating and keeping its old config will not be impacted, and the one who update its config should see the comment associated with the parameter in the config file ?  \n15:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I have not followed the development of that closely so I don't know much about it  \n15:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: it is set in the configuration file  \n15:57\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I have not myself, but I imagine that there is parameter in the config and that we debate if it on or off by default  \n15:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0by default user configuration is \"default\"  \n15:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which mean whatever is \u00a0in the configuration file  \n15:57\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but what is the default of the configuration file ?  \n15:59\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0(when nothing is set in the configuration file itself)  \n15:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0like most of the prooperty it's commented in the configuration file by default  \n15:59\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0which means ?  \n15:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which means as you can see youself it's enbaled by default...  \n15:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0enabled$  \n15:59\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0this is probably the bad part of it, I suggest to be disabled, but to uncomment the config file to enable it  \n15:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise there would not be this dicussion :)  \n16:00\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0this way, only new wiki installation will be impacted  \n16:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see the point  \n16:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is no old installation with that  \n16:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's a 3.1 feature  \n16:00\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0yes but when you upgrade from earlier release, you generally keep your configuration  \n16:01\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0or you at least review it  \n16:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so you want it to be disabled by defaul after an upgrade but enabled by default with a standard install ?  \n16:02\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so, when nothing is in the config file, if the result is a disable feature, but if the distribution contains the enabling line (not commented) in the config file, you will cover most common cases and expose the feature as well  \n16:03\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0do you get the idea ?  \n16:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no really no  \n16:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see what that change for new install  \n16:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you still have it enabled by default  \n16:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so you have the exact same bahavior  \n16:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0behavior  \n16:04\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0yes, exposing feature is good IMHO  \n16:04\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but adding feature that could be dicovered badly on upgrade is bad  \n16:05\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so I see 3 cases:  \n16:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so that' what I said \"so you want it to be disabled by defaul after an upgrade but enabled by default with a standard install\"  \n16:05\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a01) I am a new user, I just use the default config, and I get all the features  \n16:06\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a02) I am an upgrading user, I keep my config files, and do not get the feature  \n16:06\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a03) I am an upgrading user, I review the new config file, discover there is a new feature enabled, and decide or not to keep it  \n16:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I understand your point of view but I don't like too much counting that much on configuration file  \n16:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0IMO in a default install everything should be commented as much as possible  \n16:08\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not sure this a common principal  \n16:09\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0principle  \n16:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not like we were talking about something that would make en upgrade impossible  \n16:10\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0my talk is general, new install should espose as much as possible new feature, but upgrading user should decide for themself on a voluntary basis, if these feature should be enabled  \n16:11\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0else, they could discover these feature in a bad way  \n16:14\u00a0<j-saturne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:16\u00a0<j-saturne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:16\u00a0<j-saturne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0sdumitriu: Are we all set to release?  \n16:33\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n16:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I think I found a major or a blocker  \n16:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it seems the rename function does not work as normal user  \n16:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0rename page  \n16:40\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yepp, doesn't work.

This has the side effect of a lot of commits \"Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master'\" next to the ones on real features... How do you handle this?  \n18:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0fmancinelli: Those are not that bad  \n18:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Depends what you want to do with the branch  \n18:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0They can be safely ignore  \n18:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0d  \n18:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0if your changes will be pulled later then you could branch your fork repo and squash all of your revisions together then have one (or a few) commits to pull request  \n18:28\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0fmancinelli: If you do your development on separate branch (which is highly recommanded), you may follow up on master and the branches you want/need from upstream, simply by fast-forwarding them  \n18:29\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0Well I usually do this: merge upstream, create a branch for feature X from my fork/master, develop X, checkout master, merge feature X, delete branch X, merge upstream, push to my fork, send pull request on  \n18:29\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0\\*send pull request to upstream  \n18:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I would not merge anything to master, and just keep it untouched  \n18:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0good point there  \n18:33\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0denis: you mean keep the branch X and issue the pull request directly from that branch, right?  \n18:39\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0yes  \n18:41\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but more, I would suggest that you never merge to master change from upstream, but simply fast-forward it  \n18:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sometimes ff doesn't work  \n18:42\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0why, if you keep master untouched, it should always  \n18:51\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0fast-forward == rebase ?  \n18:54\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0or its something different ?  \n18:55\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0jvelociter: no, fast-forward is when a branch is backward, and is simply updated by moving forward to the last commit  \n18:56\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0ok  \n18:58\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I be back in a moment, I could resume how I setup and maintain a fork if you want  \n19:07\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0Denis: I'd be glad to  \n19:32\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0though I have to go for a while right now, but that topic is relevant to my interests :)  \n19:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0jvelociter: ok  \n19:38\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I have to go again myself  \n19:47\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:01\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<Chami>\u00a0has quit  \n20:43\u00a0<Chami>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:02\u00a0<Chami>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:09\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:47\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:47\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:59\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:59\u00a0<nickless>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:59\u00a0<nickless>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n23:59\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
