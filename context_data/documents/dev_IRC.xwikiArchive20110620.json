The post-release is only for validation, mostly for customer projects  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: there might not be any need for post release testing anymore  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with the staging strategy  \n18:49\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0ludovic insisted I test after release too, so we find bugs to release the minor version  \n18:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The binaries that are in the staging repo now are going to be copied into the final repo so what you are testing now is exactly the same as what will (if nothing is broken) be released to the wild.  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can actually kill 2 birds with one stone I think  \n18:50\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by doing one test run on the staging artifacts  \n18:50\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0staging is new for me, didn't had time to adapt to it. Also, if you awnt pre-relase while staging, you'll have to extend staging because 2 days aren't enough  \n18:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0In fact I have the sha1s of them here and if they don't match then the copy is done over.  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: how many days do you need? (that's an important parameter)  \n18:51\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0if we're gonna use staging method, I'll have to rethink my testing strategy  \n18:51\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a03-4 days, depends if I find a blocker that takes time to be seolved  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you find a blocker it's different since it also needs fixing time  \n18:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0This is off topic but I think it's a good idea to start rethinking the whole RC process now that we have staging implemented.  \n18:52\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0like we had last week with those 2 blockers.. that took one day  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: not 100% sure  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not going to change the fact that you need to give time for people to test  \n18:52\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes, but I usually find the blocker in those 3-4 days of testing  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and most of our users will only test released versions  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not staged ones)  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are 2 different aspects: the best we can test with the dev resources and the tests that can be done by the community at large  \n18:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0perhaps we could copy the release out of staging and modify the version number to say RC\\* so that what people are testing is precisely the same as what is released. What always bothered me about RC was that it wasn't the actual compile run that made the final version.  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I agree with this  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maven has the notion of promotion  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that needs to be researched  \n18:54\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: do you think 2-3 days is too much for testing ?  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because again it's not a copy  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to change several things  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- the version.properties file  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- all maven poms that get included in META)-INF  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: no, it's fine  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for one person I mean)  \n18:55\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: if no blockers are found 2-3 days is ok, but if we find blockers, that also takes time to fix and confirm the fix, which increases testing time, and also delays the release in most cases  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for a community to test (ie install in their pre prod environment, playground, etc) they usually need more than a month in total  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: that's ok  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not all problems have to be considered blockers  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a blocker is a lbocker  \n18:56\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0my utopic ideal case is when I'll have something on staging 3 days prior release  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we need to incorporate the staging/testing time in our roadmap dates  \n18:56\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0so I won't test while devs are still commiting  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie the RM needs ot take that into account  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: if you test only staging it won't happen  \n18:57\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we get our CI build working as the geneal rule  \n18:57\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I always download daily the latest trunk, but I'm not in \"hunt\" mode every day  \n18:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0indeed, with staging you will never need to test a snapshot prior to the release (announcement)  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then RM should start the release about 3-4 days prior to reelase date  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01-2 days to make the staging release and 2-3 days for testing  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's 3-5 days  \n18:58\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0basically all I'm saying is that me, as a one person who tests, is good to have 2-3 days in which everything is frozen.. so while I test, we are sure devs don't introcude new issues that I won't catch on that release  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since RC is about 2 weeks right now  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually cjdelisle I agree with you  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0RC could become this process  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could reduce it by 1 week  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's now 2 weeks)  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've always found the stabilization phase to be too long  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed once the laste milestone is released  \n19:00\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: i know that staging with 3-4 days is kinda hard because you can commit a lot in those days ..  \n19:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0We could rename the file RC but leave everything inside as the final version.  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could directly enter a staging phase  \n19:00\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0and it's valuable time taken from the dev team  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: the rule would be only commit blocker fixes  \n19:00\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the dev team continues to commit  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not for the releas  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0release  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the next one  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie on master)  \n19:00\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0we should think this over and have it written somewhere  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0obviously  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n19:01\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: what you are saying is true for RC's because when we reach RC the trunk is already on one version ahead. but it's not the case in Milesttone stages  \n19:01\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0so I don't know how can you freeze staging for M's  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I was only speaking for RCs  \n19:02\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but anyway, no one will use M's in production, so it's ok  \n19:02\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but in the case of RC's and \\_especially\\_ in final versions, we should enforce staging before release  \n19:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I branch milestones, it's just that I do it quietly so that people don't stampede to backport their new features ;)  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can decide later on if we want staging for milestones too but I'm not 100% sure yet about that  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm 100% sure we want it for RC/final though  \n19:03\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0so we are sure no one will introduce a bug in the last day before release and I might not catch it  \n19:04\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yes, we have fixed 2 bugs so far, if we were using RC names then we would now be on -rc-3  \n19:04\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0because the responsability of assuring a decent level of quality is mine :)  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's all committer's responsbiility  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not just yours sburjan`  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're mixing your role in XWiki SAS and the xwiki open source project ;)  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in any case developers must be responsible for the quality of the work they do  \n19:05\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0well if one of them needs quality, why can't the other have it too :P  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your main role from the XWiki SAS POV is to test stuff that are not tested by the opne source project (or less well tested)  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex support for IE6 which is important for cusomter projets but less for the oss project  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing on oracle, etc  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie everything that XWiki SAS supports but not specifically the open source project  \n19:06\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0it is crucial for XWiki SAS to know if they can rely on a version (IE6 support, etc).. and they want to know major bugs on a release \\_before\\_ they use it on customer projects. This is the core objective of the post-release testing.  \n19:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Remember, the final responsability falls on the release manager and he has the power to revert so there are lots of eyes on the commits that get slipped under the door before release.  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course it doens't hurt to also help the open soruce project test all the other stuff but then you have a different hat IMO (the open source one) ;)  \n19:09\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I've beaten my record last week..
