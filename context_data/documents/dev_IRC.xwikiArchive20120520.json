I'ev managed to get started the IE8 job to run on the Jenkins agent, and I see 3 tests are failing.

I've been trying to get at this for a number of hours, but it seems when I clone xwiki-platform some files are not downloaded. eg. xwiki-platform-tools and everything after xwiki-platform-extensions (alphabetically). When i download via browser i can get everything, but then that stops me from being to add . since it will add all new files that didn't get cloned  \n10:27\u00a0<jssol>\u00a0anyone have any idea how to resolve this?  \n10:28\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0are you using windows ?  \n10:29\u00a0<jssol>\u00a0i am, is this the issue  \n10:31\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0as far as I know there is still a long path issue in windows. If you want to do it on windows, I think you'll have to use cygwin, but I am not sure this will fix your issue  \n10:32\u00a0<jssol>\u00a0ok, i was having problem with ubuntu earlier, i guess I will try that again. thanks for the heads up  \n10:34\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0cloning works on ubuntu withour a problem  \n10:37\u00a0<jssol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:50\u00a0<jssol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<jssol>\u00a0windows seemed to be the problem. thank you for the help!  \n11:04\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0no problem :)  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<CIA-74>\u00a0Vincent Massol\u000f master\u000f \\* r85a3546\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/85a35464905ef31c158ce4d4a60f063bed202e51 \u000f/ (7 files in 6 dirs):\u000f [CTS] Added list1 test (unordered list) - http://git.io/jMqOFA  \n11:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:54\u00a0<CIA-74>\u00a0Vincent Massol\u000f master\u000f \\* r802a6f0\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/802a6f0e38064fafe58613c5c088134cd36e1806 \u000f/ (9 files in 9 dirs):\u000f [CTS] Added list1 test for more syntaxes - http://git.io/PmhvMQ  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:04\u00a0<jssol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:52\u00a0<qwebirc21821>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:52\u00a0<qwebirc21821>\u00a0Hello, anyone here?  \n12:53\u00a0<qwebirc21821>\u00a0I just need a quick query re: XWiki db  \n13:03\u00a0<qwebirc21821>\u00a0has quit  \n13:06\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n13:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:41\u00a0<noy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:44\u00a0<noy>\u00a0Hello all, I have a problem with xWiki 4.1 (Standalnoe install, with tomcat6 and mysql over SLES)  \n13:44\u00a0<noy>\u00a0JAVA is eating up 4 cpus with 1 user connected, this is the log:  \n13:44\u00a0<noy>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/KKkW5mpx  \n13:45\u00a0<noy>\u00a0couldn't really find anything on google \\ mailing lists \\ forums, so I guessed I must have done something wrong along the way somewhere..  \n14:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:12\u00a0<noy>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:24\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0cjd: Hi.
