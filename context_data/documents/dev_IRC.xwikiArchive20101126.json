 \ntmortagne - (16:45): s/pupose/purpose/  \njvelociter - (16:45): I think so yes  \nvmassol - (16:45): sdumitriu: re infra ML, I need to conclude the vote and set it up  \ntmortagne - (16:45): then we should not import as backup  \nvmassol - (16:46): sdumitriu: don't if you've seen this message above:  \nvmassol - (16:46): seems that author=\"\u2026\" prevents the wikis param to work  \nvmassol - (16:46): I'm referring tot he AS in the user's profile  \ntmortagne - (16:46): i don't really see the point of removing Admin user, you can generate a random passwd for it or something  \nsdumitriu - (16:47): vmassol: If you're sure, open an issue on Jira  \nvmassol - (16:47): http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiUserProfileSheet  \nvmassol - (16:47): I've added the wikis  \nvmassol - (16:47): but I don't see my changes in wikis other than the main one  \nvmassol - (16:47): sdumitriu: and the AS perf issue isn't fixed  \nvmassol - (16:47): http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/VincentMassol is very slow  \nvmassol - (16:48): I'll create a jira  \nsdumitriu - (16:48): vmassol: Might be another query that needs an idex  \nsdumitriu - (16:48): index  \nsdumitriu - (16:49): jvelociter: One thing I noticed on myxwiki is that mysql does a LOT of disk IO  \nsdumitriu - (16:49): Almost constantly there's 1-1.5 Mb/s disk read  \nsdumitriu - (16:50): I changed the query cache size to 128M and now there's almost no IO  \nsdumitriu - (16:50): mysql> show status like 'qc%';  \nsdumitriu - (16:50): Qcache\\_hits \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0| 1399582  \nsdumitriu - (16:51): One million cached results since late last night  \ntmortagne - (16:51): jvelociter: there is something wrong with http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/AllDocs when i search \"extension\" it seems to find me the right pages but if it put \"search\" it does not do anything  \nvmassol - (16:51): sdumitriu: Dashboard is slow again  \nvmassol - (16:51): but other pages are fast  \nvmassol - (16:52): is there anyone active on fixing AS bugs/improvements for 2.7?  \nvmassol - (16:52): sabageru:?  \ntmortagne - (16:52): so about Configurable system issue it's definitely caused by Admin user not existing (it's working well when i save the re-save the page)  \nsabageru - (16:53): yes vmassol, I am on it as we speak.  \nvmassol - (16:53): sabageru: ok great  \nvmassol - (16:54): sabageru: so here's one to check if you can: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-760  \njvelociter - (16:54): tmortagne: the livetable is not workoing at all for me  \njvelociter - (16:54): all docs  \ntmortagne - (16:54): jvelociter: weird, it's working very well for me except for \"search\" word  \ntmortagne - (16:55): everything else i tested is ok  \njvelociter - (16:55): wait  \njvelociter - (16:55): it's not working as guest  \ntmortagne - (16:55): could it be a keyword or something that could break the script ?  \njvelociter - (16:55): and for your \"search\" it's the same issue  \njvelociter - (16:55): it's a page that breaks it it seems  \njvelociter - (16:56): let me try to find why  \nsdumitriu - (16:56): vmassol: XE-760 is for rstavro  \nsdumitriu - (16:56): Since it's probably Velocity stuff  \nsdumitriu - (16:56): vmassol: On myxwiki profile pages load fast  \nsabageru - (16:56): vmassol: i am working on the bug with the Rollback. Unfortunately, in the current implementation it is a little bit tricky to do this. I am searchig for a workaround to display the rollback message as well or just the rollback message. I will look into that one as well that you indicated on JIRA after I am done with this rollback message issue  \ntmortagne - (16:56): jvelociter: at least i don't reproduce it locally (on a 1.6RC2 but still)  \nsdumitriu - (16:56): http://www.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/VincentMassol -> 400ms  \nvmassol - (16:57): sabageru: ok thanks, sdumitriu says it's more for rstavro  \nvmassol - (16:58): sdumitriu: takes 4-5 seconds for me on myxwiki.rog but faster than on xwiki.org  \nsdumitriu - (16:58): http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/Main/Activity?language=en -> loaded in 14.5s  \nsdumitriu - (16:58): That's huge  \njvelociter - (16:58): tmortagne: it's my change  \njvelociter - (16:58): for vmassol use case  \njvelociter - (16:59): doc.title instead of doc.getDisplayTitle  \njvelociter - (16:59): reverting it  \njvelociter - (16:59): it's not that safe :)  \ntmortagne - (16:59): ok  \njvelociter - (16:59): I will do it another way  \ntmortagne - (16:59): jvelociter: what's weird is that i'm searching in \"Page\" column wich is not supposed to be the title  \njvelociter - (17:00): yes but the title is output-ed anyway  \ntmortagne - (17:00): ok so it's not really wht i search but what is found that break the script  \ntmortagne - (17:01): look like an escaping issue  \ntmortagne - (17:04): vmassol: i don't know why but looks like code.xwiki.org as not been indexed at all when xwiki.org has been restarted after index cleanup  \njvelociter - (17:04): I think it's mode complex  \njvelociter - (17:05): vmassol: covered your use case on macros home page  \njvelociter - (17:05): it searches on title or doc.name if title is empty  \ntmortagne - (17:05): I started an indexing of not indexed documents in code.xwiki.org wiki  \njvelociter - (17:05): I think we should have this as a standard since this is how getDisplayTitle works  \ntmortagne - (17:05): yep  \nvmassol - (17:05): jvelociter: how have you done it in the end?  \njvelociter - (17:07): fixed the search query  \njvelociter - (17:07): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#set($whereSql = \"${whereSql} and (upper(doc.title) like upper('%${filterValue}%') or (doc.title is null or doc.title = '') and upper(doc.name) like upper('%${filterValue}%'))\")  \nvmassol - (17:07): ok  \nvmassol - (17:07): :)  \njvelociter - (17:07): just for the doc.title case  \nvmassol - (17:08): good enough for xwiki.org but not for the general use case  \nvmassol - (17:08): thanks jvelociter  \njvelociter - (17:08): vmassol: well it's already better than what we have no  \ntmortagne - (17:08): ha i found a bug in search app  \njvelociter - (17:08): because the behavior is not correct  \njvelociter - (17:09): at least with this the behavior is correct  \njvelociter - (17:09): (vmassol )  \nvmassol - (17:09): jvelociter: the pb is when you have computed title from the top level headers  \njvelociter - (17:09): getDisplayTitle does that ?  \njvelociter - (17:09): it renders the document etc ?  \njvelociter - (17:09): vmassol: but even though  \njvelociter - (17:10): the behavior is may be not correct, but it's already better :)  \ntmortagne - (17:10): jvelociter: it does not render the whole document, it exact first header first  \njvelociter - (17:11): ok  \njvelociter - (17:11): but you have to parse the source at keast  \ntmortagne - (17:11): yes  \ntmortagne - (17:11): but it exist since a very long time  \njvelociter - (17:11): yes I know  \njvelociter - (17:11): IMO it's not very good  \njvelociter - (17:12): it's too magical  \nvmassol - (17:12): that's not the question  \njvelociter - (17:12): and it's painful for whatever code wants to rely on the title  \nvmassol - (17:12): what\"s important is that the display of the title in the clum  \nvmassol - (17:12): column  \njvelociter - (17:12): no, but I'm giving you my opinion anyway ;)  \nvmassol - (17:12): matches the fitler  \nvmassol - (17:12): :)  \ntmortagne - (17:12): jvelociter: i agree and that's why i voted to make that disbaled by default a lon time ago  \njvelociter - (17:13): vmassol: what your asking for is nearly impossible  \nvmassol - (17:13): ah?  \nvmassol - (17:13): it's very simple  \njvelociter - (17:13): you can't search on first extracted heading  \nvmassol - (17:13): did I say that?  \nvmassol - (17:13): :)  \njvelociter - (17:13): well the actual doc.title everywhere, it works for me  \nvmassol - (17:14): I just said that they have to match  \nvmassol - (17:14): if we can't support computed titles then the displayed title should be the page title and not the computed title  \njvelociter - (17:14): but still it weak. when you click the document link the title of the page is different  \nvmassol - (17:14): 'if\"  \njvelociter - (17:14): bleah  \nvmassol - (17:14): it's better if we can support the same algo eveyrwhere of course  \njvelociter - (17:15): yes but you won't ever support that in search  \nvmassol - (17:15): ever?  \nvmassol - (17:15): :)  \njvelociter - (17:15): extracted top level heading ?  \njvelociter - (17:15): script generated ?  \nvmassol - (17:15): even when we have the doc title cache?  \njvelociter - (17:15): good luck with that  \ntmortagne - (17:15): yes even with cache  \njvelociter - (17:15): yes but you have to assume it's in the cache  \ntmortagne - (17:16): since the title could be generated based on the current user or something  \nvmassol - (17:16): ok forget cache  \nvmassol - (17:16): database table  \nvmassol - (17:16): for titles  \ntmortagne - (17:16): the result of one title could be infinite  \ntmortagne - (17:16): you can't really cache that (database or java it's not really the point)  \nvmassol - (17:16): we do that for links  \nvmassol - (17:16): we can do it for titles  \ntmortagne - (17:17): we don't support generated links  \nvmassol - (17:17): you're talking about scripts in titles tmortagne?  \ntmortagne - (17:17): yes  \nvmassol - (17:17): or scripts generated by titles?  \nvmassol - (17:18): in any case that's ok  \ntmortagne - (17:18): what \"scripts generated by titles\" means ?  \njvelociter - (17:18): titles generated by scripts  \nvmassol - (17:18): we don't support it for links either  \ntmortagne - (17:18): yes that's what i just said...  \nvmassol - (17:18): I was just trying to show that there are solutions to get that in search  \njvelociter - (17:18): then their is nearly no point in the extracting the first level heading  \njvelociter - (17:18): it's a no-feature  \njvelociter - (17:18): :)  \nvmassol - (17:18): but  \nvmassol - (17:19): I also agree we probably don't want it  \nvmassol - (17:19): but not just for livetable search  \nvmassol - (17:19): globally  \njvelociter - (17:19): yes in the end we all agree :)  \njvelociter - (17:19): right  \njvelociter - (17:19): I don't like that feature as a whole  \njvelociter - (17:19): same  \nvmassol - (17:19): all I want on my side is consistency  \ntmortagne - (17:20): and we coted to disbale it and it was re-enabled...  \ntmortagne - (17:20): s/coted/voted/  \nvmassol - (17:20): if that's the case then it means we were wrong and there was a need  \ntmortagne - (17:21): it was a wrong reason  \njvelociter - (17:21): we need to check why it has been re-enabled  \ntmortagne - (17:21): it has been enabled for retro compatibility  \nvmassol - (17:21): yes  \ntmortagne - (17:21): when we could have documented how to enable it instead  \nvmassol - (17:22): anyway someone needs to work on this topic and make a general proposal reagrding titles  \nvmassol - (17:22): tmortagne: is http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XPLUCENE-67 the reason why \u00a0VelcoityMacro wasn't showing up?
