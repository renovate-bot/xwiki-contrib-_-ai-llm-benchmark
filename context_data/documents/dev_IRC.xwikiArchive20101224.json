From EXPLAIN and the slides you gave me i found that the indexes placed on the table (only \u00a0the ones i have indicated) are the only ones necessary to speed up queries and not have a too big impact on the other operations. one thing i would suggest more would be to have a cleaner in the database in order to remove e  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:51\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0has quit  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol2>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n14:40\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:35\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:51\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:10\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0has quit  \n16:18\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:32\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n16:49\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0gang, I might have asked this before but why aren't the parameter functions in the Block interface but in the AbstractBlock implementation?  \n16:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0since all the blocks should implement AbstractBlock anyway  \n16:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0...  \n16:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I find it a bit dirty that I have to cast to AbstractBlock to be able to get / set a parameter to a block  \n17:09\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0has quit  \n17:12\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:31\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:48\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<npm\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:38\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:06\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:17\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
