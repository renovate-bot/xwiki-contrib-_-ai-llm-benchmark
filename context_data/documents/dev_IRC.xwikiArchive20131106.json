How can I change it ?  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maven itself does not force using java7, you have something in front of maven itself that set java 7 as the current Java  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess mvn lead to a script in your case  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0look at this script  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or maybe you standard java is java6 but you have your JAVA\\_HOME in your env vars pointing to java7  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: this variable is not set by default for me so I can't really tell you what is wrong for you  \n14:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I don;t have it set either  \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: something set java7 as the current java before maven is executed somewhere  \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the only sure that is sure is that it's not done by Maven itself  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you did it or something you used did it  \n14:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: it's odd because I have no scripts, I just lunch mvn exect fomr the downloaded maven  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: that mvn itself is a script  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0look at what it's doing  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe you will find how it end up with java7  \n14:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe you set MAVEN\\_OPTS or $HOME/.mavenrc  \n14:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I have release task application version 2.1, could you promote it please on Nexus ?  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: done  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't forget to release it on jira  \n14:28\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: done http://jira.xwiki.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/TASKMAN/versions  \n14:30\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: from the http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Task+Manager+Application I have clicked the refresh button, but version 2.1 does not show up.

My wiki doesn't see version 2.1  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: what do you mean by \"your wiki exactly\" if you use simple search it only looks at extension.xwiki.org  \n14:39\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, then that'snmormal, since extensions doesn't see version 2.1  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not going to see something that does not exist  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0use advanced search  \n14:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, but my issue is the extensions not being able to see version 2.1  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I can see that  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no error in the log  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have no idea why extensions.xwiki.org does not see it  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looking through nexus  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's properly listed on http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/xwiki/contrib/application-task/maven-metadata.xml  \n14:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and given the log on IRC looks like the updater is called at least  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I updated a bunch of extension this morning and it wokered well  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0worked  \n14:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, I saw  \n14:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0will have to try to reproduce it locally  \n14:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n15:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n15:06\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: and of course I can't reproduce the issue locally (2.1 imported without any issue), otherwise it would not be fun...  \n15:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: :(  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is really weird things on xwiki.org  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is still the bug where the extension page is saved without any modification that I was not able to reproduce whatever the way I tried  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like I will have to debug xwiki.org directly or something  \n16:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n16:53\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0anyone remembers a script service method having an enum (I'm testing something)?  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: org.xwiki.logging.script.LoggingScriptService  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: if I wish to have the DW starts again, what do I need to modify in status.xml?  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at the end: <state>COMPLETED</state>  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can just delete it  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the whole file?  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not a big deal  \n17:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:28\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0is now known as <Guest79630>  \n19:55\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:20\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:57\u00a0<Guest79630>\u00a0has quit  \n20:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:22\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:24\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n23:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:19\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has quit  \n23:20\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:23\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:58\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit\n"}
