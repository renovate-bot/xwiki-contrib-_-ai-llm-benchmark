ThomasM suggested this to me  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:43): [Vincent Massol] I hope it works  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:44): [sdumitriu] I'm not sure it helps  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:46): [sdumitriu] Those users are created automatically  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:46): [sdumitriu] And most of them don't do anything anyway  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:46): [sdumitriu] They just pollute the database  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:46): [sdumitriu] Deleting them keeps the database smaller  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:47): [sdumitriu] Btw, we should update xwiki.org and make XWikiAllGroup purely virtual  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:47): [sdumitriu] Right now it takes a lot to load and save  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:47): [sdumitriu] I can see that because deleting a user takes almost a minute  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:49): [sdumitriu] SecondGenerationWiki takes a lot of spam  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:49): [sdumitriu] Should we disable editing for non-admins on it?  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:01): [sdumitriu] aaronkolodjski should be disabled indeed, since it's a different kind of spam user  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:01): [sdumitriu] I think it's a real person, so disabling might send a message  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:02): [sdumitriu] Although I doubt it will come back  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:14): [sdumitriu] Caleb, up so early  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:14): No, late :)  \nlucaa left at 13:54 (\"Leaving.\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:59): [Vincent Massol] fyi I'm almost done with first part of my large xwiki-model refactoring.... still need a few hours to complete and then lots of migrator work + review all places creating reference....  \nCalebJamesDeLisl left at 19:05 (  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:47): [NielsMayer] regarding spam users, a good algorithm for autodeleting is any users with same first and last name, are created by a bot  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:48): [sdumitriu] NielsMayer: Yep, that's what I'm doing  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:48): [sdumitriu] firstname = lastname = username  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:48): [sdumitriu] = some random name  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:48): [NielsMayer] might be a good small change to make in the registration code. prevent it from happening in the first place  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:49): [NielsMayer] and maybe have the person answer a simple math question.  \n\n"}
