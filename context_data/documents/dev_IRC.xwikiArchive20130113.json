I'm trying to setup XWiki 4.4 with the Social Login Application (http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Social+Login+Application). In the end it should be possible to login using a Google OpenID account  \n21:08\u00a0<joschi>\u00a0After installing the extension and following the instructions I get the following error message in my Tomcat logs: https://gist.github.com/18b19fa99918075d2b68  \n21:08\u00a0<joschi>\u00a0The extension has been installed using XWiki's extension manager and is shown on the \"Extension Manager\" -> \"Installed extensions\" site.  \n21:08\u00a0<joschi>\u00a0Any ideas why it can't load the classes.  \n21:14\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I think I saw an error reported about the extension manager not able to load embedded jars.  \n21:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Check the mailing-list archive (xwiki-devs I think).  \n21:21\u00a0<joschi>\u00a0polx: ok, I'll see if I find it. Do you remember if this was only a problem with xwiki 4.4 or if older versions (e. g. 4.3) also had this bug?  \n21:25\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I think 4.4 only  \n22:00\u00a0<joschi>\u00a0polx: I've tried with XWiki 4.3.1 now but I get the same error  \n22:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:56\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
