It's kind of a middle road between evaluation and production.  \n10:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0debian package is targeting production, you have the base stuff setup for tomact and mysql already, need to add the rest  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the debian one is defintiely not prod ready either  \n10:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why ?  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not prod ready at all thomas  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the mysql db is not tuned for prod, it's on the same machine as tomcat which never happens in produ  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't have any mysql replication or backup configured  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not truned for perf  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0etc  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can go on and on  \n10:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't agree with you never happen for the database, it happen very often actually  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've done a lot of prod before  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it happens you can be sure that whoever does it is not serious  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well of course there's prod and prod :)  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex  \n10:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you don't always have several servers...  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if your isntance is not cirtical  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you don't care about perf  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it's another matter  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so yes I agree we need to define what prod we're talkig about  \n10:14\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0While I can understand the sentiment of a critical high perf system running 24/7 in an ITIL managed environment, ther is definitely a difference between production and production :)  \n10:14\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0me for instance, all I need is a system that works for a distributed team of 10-20 people  \n10:15\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0but I DO need it to be fairly snappy as well as good backups. But that's about it.  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO you need a DB that supports transaction at teh very least Inge-  \n10:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: hsqldb/jetty package miss a lot of performances stuff and does not allow replication etc but making impossible to use something in production because the database is on th same server is not the same level...  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or you will get corruptions at some point for sure  \n10:15\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0hsqldb does not support transactions?  \n10:16\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I'm not sure I see mysql as such a great improvement on hsqldb :P  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I don't know, I thought not but not I'm hesitating\u2026 would need to check  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/not I'm/now I'm/  \n10:16\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0hsql does as I understand.  \n10:16\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Mysql does as long as you choose Innodb.  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep was going to say that even mysql needs to be configured properyl  \n10:16\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0http://hsqldb.org/doc/guide/sessions-chapt.html  \n10:17\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0not knowing anything about hsqldb until I saw it was part of your distributable, I quickly read up on it and it sounded fairly decent.  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry I'm entering a conf call\u2026 ttyl  \n10:17\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Mysql, for all of it's quirks, is the best tested of all databases besides HSQL, and Mysql has much more community support (you can do replication and backup easily).  \n10:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: it is decent, that's what we are using it but being embedded database makes it impossible to properly do some stuff like replication and also for now XWiki does not support multiwiki on it  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0said differently we don't have much feedback on hsqldb in production  \n10:19\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0We know that big attachments are problematic ;)  \n10:19\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0(in hsql)  \n10:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and we know you can't really backup it without stopping XWiki which is not very nice for production  \n10:20\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0yes, that is the biggest issue I've seen so far, tmortagne  \n10:20\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0So I guess I could set up java or jetty in a service container and schedule it to shutdown for ann xcopy backup  \n10:21\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0(windows environment)  \n10:21\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0or I could just change to e.g. MSSQL Express og Progresql?  \n10:22\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0If you're looking for an easy time, I recommend using the most heavily tested databases.  \n10:22\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0You can get it to work on anything if you are willing to spend more time.  \n10:22\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I have yet to be convinced about mysql :P  \n10:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: MySQL has indeed some issues when in its default configuration but at least once setup properly you know that's what is tested the most with XWiki in production  \n10:24\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0And this is what I need to know to set it up properly? http://agoncalves.developpez.com/tutoriels/xwiki/creer-un-site-associatif/  \n10:25\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I know your feeling. There are a lot of little things which make it unplesent. But if you need to back it up, you can do a quick search for \"mysql backup\" and you're there.  \n10:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: this is pretty old, you have some tutorials on xwiki.org  \n10:26\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0ok. I'll look around  \n10:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you have some generic stuff on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationMySQL for example  \n10:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's less Windows oriented than the other but I doubt it will be an issue  \n10:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Admin+Tools+Application also has some scipt to check you installation on mysql  \n10:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the main things to remember is to change myisam for innodb and latin1 for utf8\\_bin  \n10:29\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0right.  \n10:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then it start to looks like a real database :)  \n10:31\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0if I ever need to change db, is it about as simple as exporting all pages, set up new fresh install with different db, and then import all pages in the new installations?  \n10:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: yes expect that exporting all pages could be less simple that it sounds  \n10:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you have a bif wiki the standard export/import won't support it properly  \n10:31\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0bif?  \n10:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but you can use scripts from extensions.xwiki.org for it  \n10:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Large+Wiki+Export  \n10:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Large+XAR+Import  \n10:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0with those you should be able to export/import anything  \n10:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we really need to improve standard ones...  \n10:34\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0a non-minor factor in my choosing xwiki was the perception that it has decent abilities when it comes to export :)  \n10:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it has if you have lots of memory ;)  \n10:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the main issue is that it's not streamed enough with standard export/import so it use a lot of memory  \n10:42\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0memory is cheap.  \n10:43\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0do you have any other nifty css classes besides \"floatinginfobox\" defined?  \n10:45\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Heh. Just slap me if I am pestering you devs too much. I can take it.  \n10:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: sorry will not help you much with css stuff  \n10:49\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: seems there are some issues on 4.2SNAPSHOT.
