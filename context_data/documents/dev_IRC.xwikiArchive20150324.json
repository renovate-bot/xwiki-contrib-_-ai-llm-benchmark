 \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crap platform release failing...  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yuck  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as far as I can see the xar plugin produced invalid page when it was executed during translation update  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(more generally where to move that RequestStatusPage - remove or move)  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Default Language should have been [en] but was []\"  \n11:36\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually looks like it was not executed  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least I don't see any commit on https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/stable-7.0.x/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-skin/xwiki-platform-skin-ui/src/main/resources/SkinsCode/Translations.xml  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't understand why it validate it during a build and not during release  \n11:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I agree with the release failure, having empty default language for a translation is wrong  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: any idea why the xar plugin fail this document only during release ?  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there shoudln't be a difference between release or not  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the xar plugin's POV)  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jenkins does not have any failure and yet the release fail with \"Default Language should have been [en] but was []\"  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying locally  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you sure this is not a page that wasn't there on jenkins and that's been added when you added translations?

 \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is not a translation  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as you can see from the github link I posted  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: could the different come from not having or having other translations ?  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thats how it works  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in guessDefaultLanguage  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0()  \n11:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then we can't see this kind of issue before the release...  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correct  \n11:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0still xar:format did not fixed it, isn't it supposed to ?  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not implemented at least  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seems to me the same algo should be applied to format goal  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could I guess  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the main issue is that it's not even possible to commit a proper new translation file since it will fail jenkins  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed that's a problem  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess we haven't seen it since we've always had translations at the same time  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really no  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we add translation only during releases  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I don't understand why we've not seen it  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess this check is not that old  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: the only thing I can think of would to consider pages named \\*Translations as special and always force the default language to be set for them, wdyt?

IMO performance is one aspect of good design  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's performance and performance  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in our case we're writing an app that doesn't require much performance at all  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why it uses a DB, uses javva, etc  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*java  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're not writing a driver  \n18:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sort of true  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0winning a few nano seconds is not going to help us  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when one query on the DB takes several ms  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we still need to be careful about performance  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not to the level of doing hacks  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(design hacks)  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n18:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well...  \n18:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sort of  \n18:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0:)  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only thing we really need to be careful about is to not have too many calls to the DB  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we need to design around that requirement  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if we want performances)  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the service layer in EJB architectures for example  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops got to go\u2026 bbl  \n18:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0see ya  \n18:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0xD  \n19:02\u00a0<Chuguniy|2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:53\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:47\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n21:05\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has quit  \n21:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:38\u00a0<Chuguniy|2>\u00a0has quit  \n22:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n23:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:53\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
