This XDOM contains a macro that calls SkinExtension#use() when it is executed. If I cache the XDOM after the macro transformations are performed then next time I use the XDOM from the case macros won't be re-executed (because they have been executed) and thus the SkinExtension#use is not called. If I cache the XDOM before the macro transformations are performed then I need to clone the XDOM each time I render (+macr  \n10:55\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mflorea: you use the {{cache}} macro ?  \n10:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvelociter: no, it's a cache internal to the office viewer module  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0mflorea: in XwikiDcoument we cache the XDOM before the tx  \n10:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0when you view and office attachment, its XDOM is cached so next time you view it is displayed quicker  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I do'nt think caching after tx is exeecuted is good in any use case (it would mean static cachnig)  \n10:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol1: so you are caching a clone, because tx are execute on the XDOM, and can affect the cached XDOM  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0actually in xwikidocument we don't use it for rendering  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0we only cache it for other operations involved in traversing the xdom (not modifying it)  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(AFAIR)  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(we do have an issue btw with translations since we only cache the default content not translations but that's another matter)  \n11:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so is there another way to protect the cached XDOM from being affecting by the tx other than cloning it before executing the tx?  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I don't see one  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0actually  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0in some future we'll implement original block notion in the XDOM  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0to handle \"generic markers\"  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0when this is done you could from a XDOM get the original one before tx  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(but that's not now anyway)  \n11:03\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol1: ok, thanks, let me see how it works if I clone the XDOM  \n11:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0fixing xwiki-core build that i broke yesterday  \n11:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol1: re office-importer + gallery macro, I'm using an ExpandedMacroBlock class internally, which extends MacroBlock and gets a BlockRenderer instead of the macro content. MacroBlock#getContent() is overwritten to render the child blocks using the known BlockRenderer. I needed this because the office viewer has to update the image blocks and its was a pain to parse the macro content each time I wanted to modify it. I hope this is not too much of a hack.  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0ok build on trunk should be fine now  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0sorry for that  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n12:13\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:55\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trunk doesn't build  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/F1k0p9b2  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when building \" Building XWiki Platform - Web - Standard\"  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: can you check?  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(might be caused by your changes)  \n13:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'll check  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I get it everytime when I build platform/web/standard  \n13:24\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is this correct: resources/uicompontents/  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note the typo  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<includes>  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<include>resources/js/\\*\\*.js</include>  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<include>resources/js/\\*\\*.css</include>  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<include>resources/uicompontents/\\*\\*.js</include>  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<include>resources/uicompontents/\\*\\*.css</include>  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</includes>  \n13:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I didn't add this  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it means uicomponents are not currently minified?  \n13:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0doesn't sound right  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've modified locally rebuilding  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still same error  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll commit since it doesn seem right anyway  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0something related: http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yuicompressor/ticket/2528046  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0coudl you have introduced some CSS3 stuff?

 \n19:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0hmm... yes... hehe  \n19:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So the value looks like \"Please navigate to {0} instead\"  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can put anything you want as parameter, it's a parameter  \n19:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes, yes, I can do that  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i tough the link was specific to a translation  \n19:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And you give [\"[[this page>>Some.Page]]\"] instead  \n19:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes  \n19:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the pb is when you need to translate the label of the link  \n19:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can have several translations  \n19:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but even then, with a few well-used translation keys and values, it can be pulled off  \n19:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and generate the parameter using the labale translation  \n19:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes  \n19:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0good  \n19:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ah  \n19:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/labale/label/  \n19:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the pb is, if I want to use this from a macro  \n19:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0of which I am not sure which is the syntax  \n19:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you are in a macro that's even better  \n19:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but even then, with a few renderers it can be pulled off  \n19:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0directly generate proper XDOM  \n19:08\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I need to translate it  \n19:08\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I cannot pass XDOM as a parameter to the message tool  \n19:08\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0can I?  \n19:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can put some code to replace after  \n19:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You can do double translation:  \n19:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0#set ($linkText = $msg.get('p1'))  \n19:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0#set ($fullMessage = $msg.get('p2', [\"[[${linkText}>>Some.Page]]\"]))  \n19:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But I prefer to rephrase so that it's not needed  \n19:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sdumitriu: yes, this I understood  \n19:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but now the pb is that I am in a macro, and I shouldn't hardcode the syntax of the current page  \n19:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0For example, you can put the whole text inside a link:  \n19:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0[[$msg.get('pleasegotothispageinstead')>>Some.Page]]  \n19:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: yeah, I could add a special placeholder, but I so don't like this solution  \n19:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: sure but i don't have much better solution  \n19:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The good thing about putting wiki syntax in the parameter is that you can use different syntax depending on the current document syntax  \n19:11\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I can generate XDOM with a link, render it in the current syntax, use it as a parameter to the msg tool  \n19:11\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0:)  \n19:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not very good  \n19:11\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0why  \n19:11\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0?  \n19:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it means yo uwill parse whatever is in the message  \n19:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0as if it was wiki syntax  \n19:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0#if ($syntax == \"xwiki/1,0\")  \n19:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#set ($param = \"[this page>SomePage]\")  \n19:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0#else  \n19:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#set ($param = \"[[this page>>SomePage]]\")  \n19:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0#end  \n19:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: no, why? I just generate a link node, put the appropriate label and link, and then render this link in the syntax of the current page, and then use this rendered version as a parameter to the translation, so that I automagically generate the appropriate syntax for the link  \n19:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but anyway, I'll figure out a hack :)  \n19:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0thanks for the help  \n19:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: if you don't have anything else than a link in the translation it's ok yes but in that case again it's better to create the XDOM by hand instead of using a parser for this  \n19:16\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I have more, but I need to pass the link as a param to the translation, as a text in the current doc syntax. and that's a good way of generating it regardless of the syntax. anyway, it doesn't really matter that much, I have enough hacks to use :)  \n19:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the problem if you parse the translation as wiki syntax is that it's not wiki syntax, you could have anything in it that could mean something in wiki syntax that you did not wanted to interpret  \n19:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but that happens anyway if you do  \n19:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0$msg.get  \n19:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean in case, even in a page script, unless the velocity macro is with wiki=false  \n19:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the translation does get rendered as wiki syntax  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that does not make it right  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it should be escaped  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that would not happen with a translation macro  \n19:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0instead of $msg.get  \n19:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, I don't know what $msg.get is doing, maybe it does escape before returning  \n19:24\u00a0<elecharny>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but it's not a specific problem to my solution  \n19:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it can't do that  \n19:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not a reason to not doing it the right way  \n19:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0because my solution is not parsing the translations, only renders the link parameter in the appropriate syntax  \n19:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since you are in a macro you have a chance to do it well  \n19:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but as you want  \n19:25\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0how?  \n19:25\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: how right  \n19:25\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0?  \n19:26\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0to escape you mean?  \n19:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0parse the right syntax with the right parser, i gave you a solution that is safer that parsing as wiki syntax something that is not, maybe there is other solution did not had much time to thing about it  \n19:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I'm not parsing anything tmortagne  \n19:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I don't understand what I'm doing wrong  \n19:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you are parsing something that is supposed to be plain text as wiki syntax  \n19:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you have anything that looks like wiki syntax in one of the translation is will be interpreted even if it should not  \n19:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so you mean before I add it to the result of the macro, I should parse it as XDOM with a plain text parser?  \n19:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0is that a rule, that translation values should not be parsed?  \n19:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, interpreted as wiki syntax  \n19:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0translation are not supposed to contains wiki syntax so yes that make parsing it with wiki parser pretty wrong since it's exactly the same thing  \n19:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I will use it as a macro content anyway, and IIRC that means passing it as text  \n19:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in which case the only option is to escape it  \n19:31\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0wrt the current syntax  \n19:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0using a placeholder still is an easy and working solution  \n19:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0are you in a java or a wiki macro ?  \n19:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0how?  \n19:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0java  \n19:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0how is a placeholder easier?  \n19:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you use a placeholder you can parse the translation with plain text parser and replace the placeholder with you LinkBlock  \n19:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I still need to parse everything with a plaintext parser...  \n19:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but then, how do I make sure that the translation value doesn't contain the placeholder anyway?  \n19:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean, besides the one that I put  \n19:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0just check  \n19:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I generate a unique placeholder?  \n19:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0andd increment a counter  \n19:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0:)  \n19:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the easiest for your macro still is to find a way to not have to mix 2 translations  \n19:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: btw you already have a placeholder, that's the {0}  \n19:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's probably worst to use that since you are not supposed to know translation syntax at this level  \n19:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n23:32\u00a0<elecharny>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:33\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
