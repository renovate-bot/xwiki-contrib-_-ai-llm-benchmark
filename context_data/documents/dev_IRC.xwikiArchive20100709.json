Should I report that annotations don't work as a XE issue?  \nsdumitriu - (16:51): No  \nsdumitriu - (16:51): You can open an issue in XAANOTATIONS  \nsdumitriu - (16:51): and close it as duplicate  \nlucaa - (16:51): but it's not a duplicate, it's a depends.  \nlucaa - (16:52): and I don't know which version to say it affects for XAANNOTATIONS, because if the same version is installed on a different platform version, it all works fine  \nlucaa - (16:53): I don't remember if I changed XAANNOTATIONS version between M2 and RC1 but if I didn't, reporting this issue on that XAANNOTATIONS version is wrong: it would reproduce on the RC but not on the M2  \nsdumitriu - (17:04): Since 2.3.2 wasn't announced yet, there's still time to redo it, if jvdrean wants to remake part of the release  \nlucaa - (17:04): jvdrean: wanna redo it?

1.13 or 1.13.1?  \nlpereira left at 17:08 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa - (17:09): 1.13 says here https://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/tags/xwiki-enterprise-2.3.2/pom.xml  \njvdrean - (17:10): yes the release is wrong  \njvdrean - (17:10): I'll redo it  \njvdrean - (17:11): it's a perfect time to discuss who'd like to do releases  \njvdrean - (17:11): (not the current one but future ones)  \nlucaa - (17:11): wait a second, jvdrean, I am trying to understand things  \njvdrean - (17:12): I released 2.3.2 with skinx 1.3 instead of 1.3.1  \njvdrean - (17:12): 1.13 / 1.13.1  \nlucaa - (17:13): which is exactly why I don't understand the jsx objects issue reproduces on 2.3.2  \nlucaa - (17:13): don't understand why  \njvdrean - (17:13): good question indeed  \nlucaa - (17:13): can you try on your machine too, jvdrean?  \nlucaa - (17:13): I took the zip from the maven  \nlucaa - (17:13): so just start it, and go to http://localhost:8282/xwiki/bin/jsx/AnnotationCode/Script?language=en  \nlucaa - (17:14): or whatever local you have, and tell me what the js starts with  \nlucaa - (17:14): I am taking into account the possibility that I am running some wrong thing  \njvdrean - (17:15): I think I know what happened  \njvdrean - (17:16): can you try to overwrite the plugin from the distrib with http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/com/xpn/xwiki/platform/plugins/xwiki-plugin-skinx/1.13/xwiki-plugin-skinx-1.13.jar ?  \njvdrean - (17:16): and see if you can reproduce  \nlucaa - (17:16): ok  \njvdrean - (17:17): the 1.13 branch pom was wrong at first since it had been copied from the tag (with version 1.13 in the pom)  \nlucaa - (17:19): still can reproduce...  \njvdrean - (17:20): frack  \njvdrean - (17:22): it's worse than expected, give me a sec  \nlucaa - (17:23): the sources of the 1.13 release on maven seem fine, I checked them out just now  \njvdrean - (17:24): yes but the artifacts was way too recent  \njvdrean - (17:24): could you try to download it again ?

besides committing the fix from sergiu on the 1.13 branch?  \njvdrean - (17:29): yes please commit the fix on both trunk and 1.13 branch  \nlucaa - (17:30): yes, for trunk I would create an issue  \nlucaa - (17:30): or something  \nlucaa - (17:30): since it affects the 1.16 released version  \nflorinciu left at 17:30 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nlucaa - (17:31): you'd replace the released 1.13.1, right? so the issue I would create doesn't have to affect 1.13.1 as well, right?  \njvdrean - (17:31): right  \nlucaa - (17:37): i would need to commit on the 1.13 branch under XSKINX-37 , should i reoped?  \nlucaa - (17:37): reopen  \njvdrean - (17:38): no need  \nasdf\\_ joined #xwiki at 17:38  \nlucaa - (17:39): ok  \nasdf\\_ left at 17:39 (Client Quit  \nlucaa - (17:44): jvdrean: committed on the branch  \nlucaa - (17:44): creating the issue now to commit on the trunk as well  \nsburjan left at 17:44 (Quit: Ex-Chat  \njvdrean - (17:47): I can't believe what I just did  \njvdrean - (17:47): I've deleted the 2.3.1 tags instead of 2.3.2  \njvdrean - (17:48): can someone pass me a rope and a stool please ?
