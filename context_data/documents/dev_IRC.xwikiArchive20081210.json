http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/URLsResolution  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:00): hi guys! does anybody know why, after making some modifications in a component, plexus keeps loading the old version?  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:22): so, the problem is with the useravatar macro. i made some modifications on it.  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:22): they reflect when running the tests  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:22): but not when rendering a page  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:23): the behaviour of the rendering engine is just like i wouldn't have changed anything in my useravatar class  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:24): you means it load the right class but en old version of that class ?  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:25): yes  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:27): i even made my class output some ordinary text messages, but it still displays the same thing as in the old version  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:27): I doubt plexus is able to do something like that :) maybe there was a problem on build  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:27): how to you test it ?  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:27): you build the jar ten tou copy parst it in your xe distribution ?  \nxwikibot - (10/12/2008 14:28): XWiki.vylum was modified by XWiki.vylum (Created user) -

(10/12/2008 14:31): and if i remove the jar, the macro no longer gets rendered  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:31): are you sure the build completely succeed ?  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:31): can you look at the jar date/time  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:32): (if you have any error even just in test the jar is not created)  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:32): try \"mvn clean install\"  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:32): to be sure the don't get an old jar  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:34): well, i don't see anything wrong with the jar, it was created a few minutes ago  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:34): you don't have differents version of the same jar ?  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:34): i considered this scenario, too, and i deleted it, and maven created me a new one  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:34): or maybe some leftover in the rendering module  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:35): as at first you add the macro in rendering and not in it's own module  \nxwikibot - (10/12/2008 14:35): FAQ.international was modified by XWiki.yangzhaohui (Is xwiki support international&#65311;) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/international  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:36): well, if there were some leftover, when removing the jar, it would continue to render the macro, right? which thing doesn't happen  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:36): yes  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:37): I don't understand  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:37): doesn't plexus store somewhere the jars it finds in the lib folder?  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:37): in some temporary location  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:37): plexus does not load any jar  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:38): it just use java classloader  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:38): the jars are loaded by your container  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:39): I guess you \u00a0are restarting the server when you change the jar, right ?  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:41): of course i restart it, \u00a0\u00a0i put this code in my macro: \" resultedBlock = new WordBlock(\"This is a test message for DEBUG\"); \" and commented the rest of it, as a result the tests fail because this doesn't match the expected output, so i build the jar skipping the tests, with \"mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true\"  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:41): do you think there is something wrong with this?  \nludobot - (10/12/2008 14:43): null  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:44): no I doubt skiping the test change anything to the jar  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:45): can you add a method to your class  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:45): than open the jar an look at the .class with Eclipse for example to see if you have the method listed  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 14:45): at least we will know if the jar is correct or not  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 14:55): done that, and the new method appears in the jar  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:05): dan\\_miron: ok  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:05): so if the jar is correct, the only thing I can think of is some leftover somewhere...  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:06): but if the macro doe not work when you remove the jar...  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:06): this is weird  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:06): hmm  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:07): in fact to work the macro need the component.xml to be found by plexus but it possible you have the class somewhere without component.xml  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:08): can you check if the rendering jar contains your class ?  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 15:08): i think i found the issue  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 15:09): XE was using the xwiki-rendering.jar from the repository  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:09): you mean your local maven repository ?  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 15:10): no, the remote repository, because i see that a newer version appeared there  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:11): how it can be an issue ? the remove rendering moduile does not contains the macro  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:12): remove=remote  \nxwikibot - (10/12/2008 15:13): XWiki.JohannaHoller was modified by XWiki.JohannaHoller (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/JohannaHoller  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 15:15): my jar contains the macro. this means it was from my local repository  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 15:15): and this what caused the problem  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:18): ok so the problem is that XE contains your old rendering jar, not that it contains the one from remote repository ;)  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:19): you shoudl always use mvn clean install in place of mvn install to build any non jar maven project  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:19): otherwise you will always get issues like this  \ndan\\_miron - (10/12/2008 15:21): well, i'll take care of that in the future  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:23): you should use the tuto in http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DebugXEWithEclipse the dependencies are dynamically managed by m2eclipse so you can't get this kind of problems  \nthomasmortagne - (10/12/2008 15:23): plus it's easier to build and debug your project  \nxwikibot - (10/12/2008 15:47): Community.DebugXEWithEclipse\\_ImportJarProjects was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DebugXEWithEclipse\\_ImportJarProjects  \nxwikibot -
