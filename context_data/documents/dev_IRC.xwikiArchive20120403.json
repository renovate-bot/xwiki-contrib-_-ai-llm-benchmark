Edy gets some configuration from an object which has some Boolean fields. Now, from my experience, the value of those fields is actually an int (0/1) and not a real Java boolean value, so if you use for instance AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource, you need to cast to Interger, not Boolean.  \n08:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: need to remove http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-manager-test-xmlrpc/, right ?  \n08:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: he is using AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource with a custom object ?  \n08:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n08:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0where is that ?  \n08:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0annotation-core  \n08:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: indeed, removing  \n08:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0AnnotationConfigurationSource / DefaultAnnotationConfiguration  \n08:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: ok  \n08:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0before looking at the detail if the xclass attribute type is a boolean I think AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource should take this into account and that the way Edy is using it should be valid but it's a bit short to fix that before the release  \n08:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I see that AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource just let DocumentAccessBridge#getProperty decide  \n08:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n08:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but I dontt think DocumentAccessBridge#getProperty should take care of this since it's supposed to follow XWikiDocument behavior  \n08:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and I'm using the same method in WysiwygEditorConfiguration where I have a few boolean fields, and I'm casting the result to Integer  \n08:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0by same method I mean DAB#getProperty  \n08:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but it's a pitty IMO since AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource could easily know it's actually a boolean  \n08:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n08:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n08:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if Edy was passing a default value we could have made AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource check the type of the value and at least convert the value coming from DocumentAccessBridge accordingly as a first step  \n08:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I can modify the code  \n08:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0although I'll assume the default value  \n08:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the safest for now is probably to go throw an integer as you suggested since I think you can define the default value in the xclass  \n08:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0through  \n08:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and create a jira issue for AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource and boolean values  \n09:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n09:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0problem is that making it return a boolean will break any code which is expecting an interger right now  \n09:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha it's internal  \n09:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n09:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it's ok we can change whatever we want :)  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not really  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's internal it shouldn't be used by another module  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's probably a mistake  \n09:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it should not be used by another module which is not sycnrhinized with the same version  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes we can go ahead and say \"hey it was internal ;))\"  \n09:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we alway use internal ouself  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not true  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's forbidden for us too  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we \\*sometimes\\* use it temporarily  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when an api is not ready for primetime  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because an internal that we use means it's not internal  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we have the need others will too  \n09:03\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I discussed with Edy about it yesterday and the \"problem\" is that everytime you want to take config from a custom object you need to duplicate code from AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it can only be temporary  \n09:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0if we make it generic, the problem is how to specify the page/class when injecting the configuration source  \n09:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyway the point is that we can improve AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n09:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: a provider  \n09:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well  \n09:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0works only for teh default provider actually  \n09:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0a custom provider will not be called for different hint actually  \n09:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then there is not much choice than a factory or a manager  \n09:06\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0either than or we change a bit the bahavior of providers and fallback on the default provider for a type when there is no provider for the provider hint  \n09:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not better actually since there is not way to pass the hint to a \"real\" provider, not like the default provider which has a special constructorr  \n09:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: so +1 to go the integer way for now  \n09:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'm doing it  \n09:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we'll see later what we want to do with AbstractDocumentConfigurationSource  \n09:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not that easy to change it's behavior actually because any change to it will change XWikiPreference configuration source
