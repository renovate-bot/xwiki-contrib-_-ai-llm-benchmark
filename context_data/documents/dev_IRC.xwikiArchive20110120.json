Can you tell me what I should ask him precisely to do?  \n13:27\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: yes, it looks like a flicker.

Someone needs to contribute a patch for it though  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not hard to do AFAIK  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the hard part for a new language is the parser and execution engine  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwse from an API POV it's easy to provide a new impl  \n14:36\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0vmassol: The reason that I asked the second question was because, locally, for what we are using xwiki for, we are attempting to back end it into a Triplestore, so it would be nice to be able to do SPARQL quries to the TripleStore  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just need to implement QueryExecutor  \n14:37\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0alright thanks.  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mbryant: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2870 for ex  \n14:39\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0from a user standpoint, it would be a nice thing to have...  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n14:40\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0just fyi, I know the current roadmap is not headed that way but... it might play into the app under a minute task  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mbryant: we also need internally to stop using hql and instead use xwql  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now we use hql almost everywhere in our code  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mbryant: so you're using xwql right now?  \n14:41\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0yea... in documents/pages  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool, works fine?  \n14:42\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0yep, the only thing that I have had to use HQL for is searching for a specific tag from the tag class  \n14:42\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0so looking for a sepecific value contained in a DBList  \n14:42\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0perhaps I should JIRA that  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I don't know xwql enough to answer that.

It doesn't point to the code which uses it.  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've spent 2 hours yesterday just to remove 2 deprecated methods from it  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order to be extra sure I'm not brealing anything  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0breaking  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I'm not even 100% sure  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same with interfaces caleb  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry misread  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I read implements  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0usage is marked with the @myannotation \u00a0syntax  \n17:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Somewhere burried in the mass of code is something which also points to that annotation. The only way to find it is fins ./ -name '\\*.java' -exec grep '@ThingThatDoesSomething' {} \\; -print  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do you better for interfaces?  \n17:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Interfaces are fine on their own, when you bring dependency injection into the mix you get the same problems.  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw if you use a proper IDE you can ask it where the annotation is used  \n17:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe, that's also a good sign that something is wrong with a language when you need a program to write it for you.  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok java is worng since I need an ide to write it  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0end of story  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I hope you don't want to remove or not use annotations in xwiki because I wouldn't like it  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0quite the opposite I'd like more of them  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example for @permission  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@api (or @script), etc  \n17:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://viewfromthefringe.blogspot.com/2010/02/java-annotations-have-become-pixie-dust.html  \n17:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I remember liking that view.  \n17:51\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But then I'm generally a luddite, I want to use code that anyone who knows the 50 java keywords can read.  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we have a complete different POV. My preference always goes to maintainability/readability  \n17:53\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Same here but I think that annotations hurt maintainability/readability.  \n17:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0be careful not to overdo it, ie to make it more complex (too clever?) to use than the initial \"problem\" you're trying to solve :)  \n17:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0See a snippet of code, 10 lines, 3 of them annotations. It'll take me all day to resolve exactly how that works.  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's if you have to undestand it  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the point is that you shouldn't  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here one's line: parser.parse(\"wiki syntax here\")  \n17:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Then how do you maintain or debug it?  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you need to understand this then you'll psend more than a day  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you have to recode everything you want to use you're dead  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll never be able to build a software like xwiki  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if it weren't for existing libraries we would never have been able to do it)  \n17:58\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I wouldn't want to write \\_everything\\_ myself. But I do want to review everything I include.  \n17:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm responsable for bringing in Bouncycastle library but of everything xwiki-crypto uses, I have read (or scanned) every line throughout the path of execution.  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't read the full jdk source code I use and I'm glad. At some point you need to trust the apis you're using. Otherwise it's a lot of work  \n18:00\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ditto, but I have run in to bugs and been very glad that I could pull up the code for java.lang.Class or similar and follow through it and understand exactly how it works.  \n18:01\u00a0<qwebirc68522>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:01\u00a0<qwebirc68522>\u00a0...  \n18:01\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0....  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but that's only for debugging and you can do the exact same for annotation, just read the annotation code (which is \"java\" code)  \n18:01\u00a0<qwebirc68522>\u00a0has quit  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok stopping now  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this discussion won't lead us anywhere :)  \n18:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Sometimes annotations have no code in themselves  \n18:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cu  \n18:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0For example the @Deprecated annotation  \n18:02\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Maybe so, maybe not. IMO it is good to look at different points of view.  \n18:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's there to mark interfaces  \n18:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But to find out who prints the deprecation warnings in the log, you'd have to see at all users of the Deprecated annotation  \n18:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Java used to do that with empty interfaces, like Serializable  \n18:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\u00a0ie to make it more complex (too clever?) to use than the initial \u00a0\"problem\"  \n18:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\" \"  \n18:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That's something I thought a lot about.  \n18:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0TransactionRunnable is 491 lines and has lots of javadoc commentary.  \n18:07\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That's also something I accuse the java community process of having a hard time with. Everyone wants their use case explicitly satisfied and the code becomes too complex and large.  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends, the latest releases of JEE specs are really good  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes consensus leads to that  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the same for xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it has good sides too  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(xwiki is consensus based dev)  \n18:09\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Consensus is great for a project that is already moving.  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n18:09\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But when all you have is an idea, IMO you need to write it and make it work before you let other people get involved.  \n18:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0All projects should start around a simple existing codebase  \n18:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Trying to create a project from the design phase often leads to failure  \n18:10\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Otherwise everyone wants to take it a different direction and there is no visionary kernel for it to sit on.  \n18:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since everyone will want his ideas in in the first release  \n18:10\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^yea that  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which isn't what the JCP does btw  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they always have a reference impl to prove it works  \n18:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That is good. Still it seems everything JCP is huge.  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ the people invovled have great exp in the domain having already written implementations  \n18:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a vision is important indeed  \n18:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Another thing I think is important is that the developer needs to become the user and then the developer again. It is just too easy to write things which are unusable if you (I) don't use them first.  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes hence TDD btw  \n18:14\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Tests are helpful but they usually aren't real workd use cases. I can say quite certainly that TransactionRunnable works quite well for saving attachments on the filesystem.  \n18:15\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That is to say it's easy to use the api.  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can compare the # of lines to write to use it vs the try/catch idiom for ex  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as an indicator)  \n18:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Also something I ask myself when writing is \"can I test this without mocking?\" If the answer is no then I consider the code not modular enough.  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's good too in most cases  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at some point you need to mock though, for ex for accessing the real filesystem or the DB  \n18:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0For filesystem tests I use the /tmp/ dir, for db, yes we will need a MockDBTransactionRunnable  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for filesystem it's bad to depend on the environment too  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's unnecessary points of failures  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ won't work on some OS ;)  \n18:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0by /tmp/ I mean System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir)  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I know  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it can be full, it can be read only, etc  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it can be locked by another process  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lots of potential failures  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I did in the past  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and I loved that)  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was to use a virtual file system framework  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it was apache vfs I used)  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and my tests were using the RAM implementation of vfs  \n18:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It provides you with File instances and new FileOutputStream() does not write to the disk?  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the nice thing was that my software was working on every type of file system: local, ftp,ssh, etc  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only problem is that apache vfs died (not maintained)  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is a pity  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://commons.apache.org/vfs/  \n18:21\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0not maintained. qmail isn't maintained but it's far from dead ;)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not maintained == dead for me  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since no softwate is perfect  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when you have a bug you're kind of stuck  \n18:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe I think djb would disagree.  \n18:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But, yea. the rest of us don't write perfect code.  \n18:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Pretty impressive it was written in '98 and it built and worked fine for me.  \n18:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0myxwiki crashed again waiting for mysql data, while mysql considers all data sent  \n18:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Re changing the schema. I don't want to change the schema with the only engine supporting the old schema being the legacy engine in the core.  \n18:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0We can break XHS.java up into TransactionRunnables and then we have a clean implementation of the old schema and whetever we don't like in the old schema we can pull out and replace one at a time.  \n18:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't like the idea of relying on XHS.java for migration.  \n18:54\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: how do I handle ${project.version} in release:prepare? it tells me that it isn't resolved (still a snapshot) but it's snapshot because it's the version of the project I'm releasing.  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I think what I do is replace manually with the version, release then reset project.version  \n19:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, I see  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'd need to find a better way but that works at least  \n19:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I have never explored it but there's a very cool versions plugin  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/  \n19:30\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:41\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0hey guys, what has to be done to make xwiki usable with xwiki? \u00a0i login but it never seems to actually login  \n19:57\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0haha, found a posting on the mailing list, sweet  \n19:58\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:01\u00a0<SvenDowideit\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0daemoen: what browser are you using ?  \n20:11\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n20:14\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0sburjan`, lol, that question should have been \"what has to be done to make xwiki usable with safari\"  \n20:14\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0guess i got a bit excited. \u00a0found a solution on the mailing list so its all good now  \n20:15\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0daemoen: we are aware of that, we will try to fix that.
