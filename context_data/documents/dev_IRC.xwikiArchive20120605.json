Thanks.  \n09:56\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I'm authoring a developer handbook for our new distributed development teams - and xwiki seems like a good choice of tool for the purpose.  \n09:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I would say yes but I'm (strangely) a bit biased ;)  \n09:58\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0who would have thought!  \n09:58\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I would expect you to have investigated other wikis before starting on this project however.  \n09:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea I used to use mostly dokuwiki \u00a0and a bit mediawiki (through wikipedia) before starting to work on XWiki  \n10:00\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I could have told you that XWiki was a better platform :P  \n10:00\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I haven't really looked at them much, but the syntax and the wysiwyg editor of xwiki are great bonuses  \n10:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n10:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I was using dokuwiki because you can hadly find lighter wiki you can put on pretty much all free hosting, but that was before XWiki Cloud ;)  \n10:03\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I was also fairly impressed with the speed of XWiki. Hope I can keep it snappy when content grows.  \n10:04\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0And I should probably try to write something up regarding styling it - that was not trivial. I've changed/uploaded logo.png files half a dozen times/places before I got it to change the logo :) It is starting to fall into place, but I stil don't feel I have a good understanding of how that stuff works (and I know crap all about css - which doesn't help \\*cough\\*)  \n10:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: not skin expert but you can do all sort of customization in the color theme including logo I think  \n10:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0about speed you can also look at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Performances is you did not already seen it  \n10:08\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0right, thanks.  \n10:15\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n10:17\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Hm. is it possible to have an xwiki link to another page inside a code block?  \n10:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Hello devs. can someone upgrade to the latest Selenium 2 version because I am unable to start ui-tests on IE9 and the selenium guys told me I get a better stacktrace using the newest version  \n10:18\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it is a known issue  \n10:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: no, code block is by definition verbatim  \n10:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/block/macro/  \n10:18\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0mumble... ok :)  \n10:29\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<CIA-117>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r889931d\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/889931de3fa11c2e097c180ff82584bd5e62f2e6 \u000f/ pom.xml :\u000f XCOMMONS-186: Upgrade to Selenium 2.22 - http://git.io/bxMvOA  \n11:08\u00a0<CIA-117>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* rf308d2d\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/f308d2d2de5d437ddf8f9a73527ba13a4ad75853 \u000f/ pom.xml :\u000f [misc] Update parent after incrementing the version. - http://git.io/9uRIGg  \n11:10\u00a0<CIA-117>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* rdb187f6\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/commit/db187f69283caec6d94820064420c0b6d859917d \u000f/ pom.xml :\u000f [misc] Update the parent version after incrementing the xwiki-enterprise version. - http://git.io/0OI4gg  \n11:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: you forgot to update the parent versions after creating the branches  \n11:11\u00a0<CIA-117>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r8aa4d8d\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/8aa4d8d7984b5b15988ebcdf88ed4de8b8c33926 \u000f/ pom.xml :\u000f [misc] Update parent version after incrementing xwiki-rendering version. - http://git.io/lj1YMg  \n11:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(looks like mflorea is taking care of it)  \n11:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep, I upgraded selenium and I didn't understood why the new version is not taken into account :)  \n11:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0thanks mflorea \u00a0!! :)  \n11:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sburjan: ;)  \n11:34\u00a0<CIA-117>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* rdfa9622\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-manager/commit/dfa9622b00c46496b3fac62b8f12dd25940bcc24 \u000f/ pom.xml :\u000f [misc] Update parent version after incrementing xwiki-manager version. - http://git.io/L6ymJw  \n11:40\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:43\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: ping  \n11:59\u00a0<CIA-117>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f stable-4.1.x\u000f \\* r55e009b\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/55e009bd0523f261cc35c1123601e0c4511b1bc5 \u000f/ (30 files in 13 dirs):\u000f Merge branch 'feature-diff-display' into stable-4.1.x (+14 more commits...) - http://git.io/uGU1zQ  \n11:59\u00a0<CIA-117>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* ra43ad56\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/a43ad5637299a77eacc5b4dab7e6ac7807a6d612 \u000f/ xwiki-commons-core/xwiki-commons-diff/xwiki-commons-diff-display/pom.xml :\u000f [misc] Increment version.
