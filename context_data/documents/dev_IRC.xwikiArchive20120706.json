 \n20:26\u00a0<polx>\u00a0One use case could be the request to upgrade the profile in some way.  \n20:26\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Another could be a request to join a network.  \n20:26\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/XWikiNotifications  \n20:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Interesting.  \n20:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0But this is triggered by a javascript call, itself probably by rendering, correct?  \n20:29\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0don't know :) .. it's javascript all right, I don't think the rendering is involved  \n20:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I meant... it's js so it's triggered by an in-page JS.  \n20:31\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0never used them \u2026 I know they exist. The notifications are bundled by default. They are used in the Save page mechanism, etc. I don't think is an in-page JS, maybe they are called from xwiki.js - but don't know for sure  \n20:31\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Fine. Thanks.  \n20:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I think the back-end is missing to me... when it is filed into the session... how are they prioritized to be displayed.  \n20:32\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0not in xwiki.js .. they have their on notifications.js  \n20:32\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0\\*own  \n20:36\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:14\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:55\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:26\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
