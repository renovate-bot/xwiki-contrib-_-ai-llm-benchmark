Now starting paperwork  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: I think it simply means that when you navigate to an attachment on a wiki page and you try to access it, it'll fail  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since xwiki won't find it in the DB  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in other words, I don't think we have a script to copy file attachments to the DB ATM  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we have one for the other way around only)  \n11:03\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0my question is about versionning, not filesystem/db  \n11:03\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0about xwiki.store.attachment.versioning=0  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes sorry  \n11:04\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0hi vmassol btw :)  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no cleanup in the DB  \n11:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh hah sorry, I totally didn't read what you said correctly  \n11:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ignore me :)  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so existing attachment history will still be in the DB  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but new attachment won't get any history  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*attachments  \n11:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Well it's \\*file\\* attachment versioning, if you switch to 0 then there will be versions of attachments remaining on the FS  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the UI may not show history for previous attachments though, I don't really know  \n11:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but they will not get in the way, just use some space  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes sorry again, FS ;)  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but same rule  \n11:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Everyone could use a holiday, we all managed to misread the phrase :)  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:06\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0lol !  \n11:06\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0not FS in my case but DB :)  \n11:07\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I think I get it  \n11:07\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0And can I remove older version easily ?  \n11:07\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0Is there an existing script or do I have to write one ?  \n11:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it would be a delete from table command, if it's not documented anywhere on xwiki.org you should be able to figure it out from the schema  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess you could empty the xwikiattachment\\_archive table bu t I've not done that  \n11:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yes, that's what I'd do but always backup the database before doing anything major  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/XWikiAttachmentArchive  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/DatabaseSchema )  \n11:10\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0thanks  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: I wouldn't drop the table, just empty it  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to be on the safe side)  \n11:25\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, yeah, understood  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0more spam coming, sorry\u2026 :)  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0release done  \n11:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: is it possible to install a webjar in a subwiki ?  \n11:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0we're seeing like: http://localhost:8080/xwiki/webjars/codemirror/5.8/lib/codemirror.css  \n11:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and in a subwiki the syntax highlighting doesn't work  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: yes it's possible, see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12884 and http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11571  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it depends on your version  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so short story: starting from 7.1M1 it wasn't possible anymore  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's been fixed  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in 7.1.4 and 7.4M2+  \n11:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n11:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0thanks  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you muted the boit?  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*bot  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's been several changes I made to xwiki.org that didn't appear here  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I don't see any mute command...  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes you did  \n12:15\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0-q, I think  \n12:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I did because it was doing an import-extension-from-maven  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing quickly 7.4RC1...  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: hi, I think there might be a problem with https://www.evernote.com/l/AHfUJ1B5EBVGNqLRluIibXbMUwfl4dp\\_BME  \n14:07\u00a0<yflory>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea, gdelhumeau, ClemensR: do you agree about http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12929 ?  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: maybe you could check http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12930 ?  \n14:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0why are there \u00a0two Page 3?  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the bug :)  \n14:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0translations  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think that sorting can work fine anyway mflorea  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n14:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0h, and disabling the sort would make sure the bug is no longer visible, instead of fixing it?  \n14:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(I should reproduce this first, before firing questions around)  \n14:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I agree that sorting on the title can be confusing  \n14:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0because we display the rendered title and we sort on the raw title  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW I was wondering if we should remove the title column and instead have a single Location column and display the title in there. For example: \u00a0\"Sandbox / Test Page 1 (Sandbox Test Page 1)\"  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR I've done a test with my kid and the first WTF he experienced was when he tried filtering on the title column and there was no input field. He didn't understand why had to use the Location column to do that\u2026  \n14:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0then the Location sort/filter will be confusing  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be only on the location not on the title (if the title is displayed in italic or something maybe it would'nt be that confusing - at least users would get some results)  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or maybe some text to display where the filter should be for the Title column  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Use Location column to filter\", \"Not filterable\", ?  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0users don't really get the difference between page name and titles, hence the reason I was thinking about putting them together for now  \n14:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0another thing, the location should probably be relative to the parent on the Children viewer. It doesn't make sense to repeat \"Sandbox\" on each row when you know from the title that these are the children of Sandbox  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and another one: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12931  \n14:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but then it will complicate the filtering  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow in 5 minutes found 4 issues  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're missing polishing  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed mflorea  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12932 now  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12933  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm any idea why SandBox.WebHome is at 2.1?  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the xml file the version is 1.1  \n14:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0my guess is that it has to do with the attachment. I see that XWiki.AdminSheet is also 2.1  \n14:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0same for Main.SolrSearch  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found another regression  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12934  \n14:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I don't have it  \n14:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0what version are you testing on?  \n14:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the menu is fine for me on the history viewer  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm then it's cache  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n14:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I remember I've seen issue in the past but I think it was fixed  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it was fixed  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why I was calling this a regression  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking my cache  \n14:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I have a 7.4-SNAPSHOT from yesterday  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not a cahce issue  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you sure you're using the edit action?  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and not view)  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/AdminSheet?editor=history  \n14:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0hmm, edit with viewer=history? that doesn't make senses  \n14:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0viewer=xyz works with view action afaik  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what doesn't make sense is what is diqplyed  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*displayed  \n14:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0edit action has editor param  \n14:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0how did you get this URL?  \n14:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the display is broken on my instance also, but I don't think this URL makes sense  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what doesn't make sens is what is displayed  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we don't support this we shouldn't display something wrong  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now it's broken  \n14:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you can mix actions with any params, that doesn't mean the result will be ok  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was trying to see the history for this page  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I don't agree  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the param shouldn't have any effect  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the page should \\*never\\* be broken  \n14:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's a problem if there is some UI that uses this URL  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no it's a problem even if no UI uses it  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the proof is that I got to it and found it a bug  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was just trying to see the history of XWiki.AdminSheet  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and there's no other way I know of doing that btw :)  \n14:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0history is a viewer and viewers work with view action, anyway, even if it's a problem, it's a very small problem  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I didn't say it was a big problem indeed :)  \n14:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you don't edit the history, you view it  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0show me how  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for that page)  \n14:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/AdminSheet?viewer=history  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes my bad  \n14:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was using editor=history  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(wrongly)  \n14:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Main.MailConfig is 2.1 also  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes so it seems a general issue  \n14:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't think it's a coincidence that all pages with attachments have 2.1  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wheneere there's an attachment  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0added the info to http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12933  \n14:59\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: we have a jira issue for the CTRL+G suggest showing translations, right?
