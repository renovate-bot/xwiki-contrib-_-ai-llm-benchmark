I assumed it just displayed the wiki \u00a0markup as it would be displayed on the page and then if the user makes any changes it translates those changes into wiki mark-up, is that the case?  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 10:45): yes  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 10:45): afaik we don't have any doc about how the wysiwyg works  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 10:47): hmm, so is there a clear divide in the folders(i.e. the actual files that make up the wiki) between the part that displays code in the wysiwyg editor and the part that translates that back into wiki markup (jvdrean)  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:14): jvdrean: Do you think I will have any hope of editing the WYSIWYG editor to insert images in the form {image:imagename.png| document=Main.documentname} or will it be too difficult?  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 11:15): I still don't get why you want to insert the document name :)  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 11:15): bburns: yep there's still hope  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 11:15): search for insertImage() in the wysiwyg folder  \nxwikibot - (08/08/2008 11:15): Results for [for insertImage() in the wysiwyg folder] (5 results only)  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:16): jvdrean: I'll give you the long \u00a0version. I have various country pages which are each displayed on one wiki page  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:16): each country has various section, e.g overview, introduction, etc.  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:18): I want to be able to display all the overviews on a separate page. I have done this using the get ContentofSection() command and it now works well. The problem is that when I view the section on the page the images aren't displayed because the document which returns the search results obviously doesn't have those results attached  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:19): ideally I would use \u00a0something along the lines of #includesection but this doesn't exist yet. so for now my solution is to ensure that all images have the document name in their code so that they can be displayed when I getContentofSection to another oage  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:22): jvdrean: where is the wysiwyg folder?  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 11:23): bburns: xwiki/tiny\\_mce/  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:23): aaah, I thought you mean a folder nameed wysiwyg  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 11:26): tiny\\_mce/themes/wikieditor/editor\\_template.js  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:29): jvdrean: ok, I'll see what I can figure out, thank you  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:38): jvdrean: I have change lots of different little things in my .js files but they seem tro make absolutely no difference. (I would have thought that I would have broken it if nothing else?)  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:38): do I need to restart the wiki?  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 11:40): if you've made it directly in you deployed webapp you just have to clear the browser's cache  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 11:40): ctrl+shift+r with ff  \nBBurns - (08/08/2008 11:40): aah, ok  \nbburns - (08/08/2008 11:41): lol, did it in the wrong window  \nbburns - (08/08/2008 11:53): jvdrean: no luck, I'm thinking of giving up I'm afraid  \njvdrean - (08/08/2008 11:57): bburns: the html>wiki conversion is done in xwiki/wiki\\_editor/plugins/core.js  \nxwikibot - (08/08/2008 12:49): XWiki.AndersonGodoi was modified by XWiki.AndersonGodoi (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/AndersonGodoi  \nxwikibot - (08/08/2008 14:22): XWiki.razmatei was modified by XWiki.razmatei (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/razmatei  \nxwikibot - (08/08/2008 17:00): DevGuide.Creating a form with validation and tooltips was modified by xwiki:XWiki.Sergiu (Added comment) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Creating+a+form+with+validation+and+tooltips  \nxwikibot - (08/08/2008 17:00): DevGuide.Creating a form with validation and tooltips was modified by xwiki:XWiki.Sergiu (Added comment) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Creating+a+form+with+validation+and+tooltips  \nxwikibot - (08/08/2008 17:11): DevGuide.Creating a form with validation and tooltips was modified by xwiki:XWiki.Sergiu (Deleted object) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Creating+a+form+with+validation+and+tooltips  \nxwikibot - (08/08/2008 19:22): XWiki.jyau10 was modified by XWiki.jyau10 (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/jyau10  \n\n"}
