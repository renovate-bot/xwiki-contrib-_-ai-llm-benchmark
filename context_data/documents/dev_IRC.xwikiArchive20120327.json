Is this normal ?  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's nothing \"normal\", you should send a mail on the list with all your findings and suggestions and ask people to give their opinions  \n10:28\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this is why I don't like to test when I don't know the behaviour, because I never know if it's intended or not  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't matter  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's intended or not  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the fact that you don't find it good is enough for you to justify proposing something better  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0said differently  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not because something is intended but behaving a in bad manner that we shouldn't improve it :)  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I would even argue  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that it's best if you don't know what's intended  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it won't skew your judgement!  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n10:33\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well maybe Eduard had good reasons for doing it like this, or maybe he didn't had the end-user perspecitve (which I am having always when testing something new).. so maybe a vote on the list with what I don't like could help us shape the intended behavior  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have confidence in you sburjan  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it happens you were wrong and someone tells you after you've proposed an improvement so bet it, you'll just have learnt something and you'll progress  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/bet/be/  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't do a vote  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just send a list of ideas for further improvements  \n10:35\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yepp... I never send a vote until I personally talk with other 3 people and they agree too :)  \n10:36\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'll send a list of what I have found from a end user perspective, and everybody can state their opinions  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well you can't really send a vote  \n10:36\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, because I am not a committer  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait forget that  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you can send ideas/suggestions/etc  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is the same  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbiab  \n10:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0thanks for the suggesteions, I will send a list of ideas/suggestions, and see what the community thinks  \n10:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:49\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0evalica, hi.  \n11:50\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0I want to send my GSoC application but I would like you to see it first and tell me if I miss something.  \n11:50\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0well you should post in in melange  \n11:50\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0mentors can comment there  \n11:50\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0until the deadline you can make adjustments there  \n11:50\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0evalica, I sent it to the devs mail list and you gave it \u00a0look with a few comments.
