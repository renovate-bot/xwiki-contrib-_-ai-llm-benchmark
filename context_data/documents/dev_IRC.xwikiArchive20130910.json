I'm going trial and error since I'm not a master of the Lucene/Solr query syntax. I have a backup solution but I want to try some more maybe I find a better one  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: regarding failing jobs, there is not much time left for me to look for a selenium workaround so I guess it's safer to revert the selenium upgrade (and the FF upgrade on CI agents). I can try to fix it after M2 release, for RC1.  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes ok  \n10:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0last time I checked most of the tests failures were due to selenium upgrade  \n10:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll revert the upgrade after I finish with search suggest  \n10:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has quit  \n11:21\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n11:21\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:22\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:52\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0I have a quick Maven question.
