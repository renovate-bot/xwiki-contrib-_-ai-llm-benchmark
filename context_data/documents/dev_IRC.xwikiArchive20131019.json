One question: with signed scripts will a subwiki admin be allowed to sign content too?  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't recall what is the condition for someone to be allowed to sign scripts  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm trying to answer Dmitry's answer on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XEM-208 )  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll answer something in comment and maybe you can verify what I wrote to correct me if Im' wrong  \n10:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0well, just look at the my general idea about it  \n10:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I have just open XWIKI-9577  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XEM-208?focusedCommentId=77766&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-77766  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've commented  \n10:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0IMO, any one could sign anything, this does not means the signed stuff will receive any special right, this is another matter  \n10:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0signature will provide integrity, and possibily, authorship  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok why not, but that's the same you'll still need to say this user has special power  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for dangerous actions)  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(like PR actions we have now)  \n10:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the question is, do we link author of signature to XWiki user, or link author of signature to rights  \n10:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0or both  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok but in any case the use case raised by Dmitry should be taken into accoutn right?  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie the ability to have some author of a subwiki do dangerous things if he's allowed)  \n10:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Currently, I am thinking about it to be as modular as possible, separating matters (intergrity, authorship, rights)  \n10:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0then we will need some discussion how to mix them together  \n10:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0until we have the good way to sign a block of content, being able to store a conclusion made on that signature efficiently, \u00a0I do not see the need for discussing how those conclusions are made  \n10:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the POC of Thomas D. is nice, but is absolutely not modular and extensible the way we need it, it does not allow what Dmitry is looking for at all  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:46\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I have commented a bit more, so Dmitry should get the upcoming changes  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n10:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0hope you agree on my comments  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're vague enough so one cannot disagree :)  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so fine with me so far!  \n10:50\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0more I look into it, more I see new possibilities that I do not want to close, the difficulty will be to progress efficiently and progressively  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah we shoud list all possibilites and stuff we will want to do in the future but at some point we'll need to start and focus only on a small subset and find a way to progress iteratively  \n11:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0fully agreed  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:11\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:05\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n14:05\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:50\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:38\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:04\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:45\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:24\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:35\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:35\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:42\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
