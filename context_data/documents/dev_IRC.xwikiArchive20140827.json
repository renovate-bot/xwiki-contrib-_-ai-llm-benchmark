If you want to access it from another component, you define your own interface (role) and your implementation will implement both. You use script service only if you need to access it from $services from scripts  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you will have to cast your ScriptService since this interface itself does not contain any method  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that why ScriptService is usually not used from other component  \n16:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, so i need to define new role  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ScriptService is meant to be a facade calling the actual component doing the job behind the scene  \n16:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, thanks  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically you should never have any other logic than what is specific to scripting in ScriptService and put everything else in a custom component  \n16:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes tmortagne's last point is the most important  \n16:29\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:45\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:52\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:55\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tweet:  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"https://twitter.com/mojavelinux/ any work with https://twitter.com/search?q=%23xwiki to support https://twitter.com/search?q=%23asciidoctor in syntaxes?
