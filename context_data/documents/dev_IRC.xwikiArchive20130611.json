I find the documentation on Clustering very incomplete. I either have to read about clustering in general, or this page is totally incomplete: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Clustering .I won't be able tosetup a XWiki in cluster only with this, sorry  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: you forgot to click on the links  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've checked and this page has everything you need AFAICS  \n10:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well in the first place I don't quite see a description on how clustering works with XWiki  \n10:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0or if I am a begginner (like me) .. what is clustering and why I'd need it  \n10:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0also, the documentation from JGroups seems a mess too :)  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: the question is not wheher the doc is perfect or not  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can improve it later  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's whether you can use it, and it's very clear to me  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has very specific step by step details  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you should definitely be able to use it  \n10:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I only see 2 steps .. Please note that I don't have your experience so it's harder for me to understand what is going on there  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: can you please read the full page  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not just portions  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hat's the problem with this link \"Follow the http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/DistributedEventClusterSetup for a complete tutorial on how to setup a simple cluster between two instances of XWiki on the same server.\"  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you can't do this then sorry but it's pretty simple...  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's pretty well described hwat clustering is  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"The goal of a cluster of XWiki instance is to provide several XWiki in different servers accessing the same database server to be able to do load balancing.\"  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I think you're really not hepling yourself  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:(  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again, the doc is pretty bad in consistency and organization  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I definitely agree  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if you read it you should be able to set it up easily  \n10:29\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, I didn't got reading till the end of the doc, where the link to the tutorial was  \n10:30\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:30\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n10:58\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: do you have a solution to progress on the solr issue raised yesterday for M2?  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XWIKI-9217 ?  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's one aspect but the main issue raised by sorin if that he could not find standard pages and he not find standard pages because the UI search for en locale and standard pages don't have any locale  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0couldn't pages with no locale be returned too?  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure they could but that's something for the thread I started  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm just worried that this thread might take a long time to stabilize because it seems the issue is complex  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it is complex  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I was wondering if there was a way to make it acceptable for now so that we can release M2 and then make changes later depending on the result of the thread  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so for M2 we need to decide what exactly we want the behavior to be, do we want to find all default pages, only the one containing real english etc  \n11:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0just sent my position on the ML  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in practice SOLR is still experimental so it not like it was supposed to block this release  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reading  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we could simply go for the release  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well if nothing is returned it's an issue since our goal is to have solr ready by the end of 5.1 and we want users to start testing it  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's not nothing and the standard pages  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/and/only ?  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue is pretty simple: the UI search for en and standard pages are not en  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you create a new page it gets the default language which mean en if you don't change the settings  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you find it when searching  \n11:15\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:25\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: ping  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: yes?  \n12:35\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: could you create test.xwiki.org so I can deploy ?  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we agree about the name in the end? didn't check the thread  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok just read it  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ok, we can change later on if need be  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0creating  \n12:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I agree about what you said.

 \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see we're using Wiki Manager Application 4.5.2  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: would you remember the part that I have to change?  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to comment out the printUsersAndGroups macro  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works :)  \n12:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0guys, any idea why mvn xar:format puts a <template/> tag in my xml files ?

 \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the issue fixed by thomas not long ago maybe  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so maybe I'd need a restart of xwiki.org?  \n13:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's possible xwiki.org is confured to have DW only on main wiki  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I tried to force it but got https://www.evernote.com/shard/s119/sh/d8f9d6a7-6a95-4c57-9269-09859c771775/d90825933b898ca4593204a201a65424 ;)  \n13:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: what do you mean by force it ?

 \n13:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess mflorea did not do anything to have a nice display when no job is running  \n13:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not by hand no  \n13:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tmortagne: xwiki.org is 4.5.2  \n13:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no wiki DW before 5.0  \n13:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n13:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol:  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so my choice is to install manually the admin application XAR to try to get the EM UI  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?

we know it's a test...  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like: http://test.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Workspace+Tests/testAcceptInvitation  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why not \"Accept Invitation\"  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sometime you do that and sometime you don't, it's confusing and not consitent  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sometime your test name starts with uppercase and sometimes not  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally I'd have used human-readable names  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as in :  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Add and Delete Annotations\" instead of \"AddAndDeleteAnnotations\"  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you know that we can use whitespaces in page names :)  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0If I were to add a new test I wouldn't know how to name since the current names are a mess  \n14:30\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: you wanted to map manual tests to autoamted tests. usually the tests which start with \"test\" are either automated OR they are renamed like this because of the convention I think we had about naming tests :)  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I never said that  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I said to map the categories  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and again I told you that the test anmes are not good  \n14:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0one year ago we had a discussion  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you do need to have a link  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not in the user friendly name  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's bad)  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the link is a technical link  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well you could have the exact name but:  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) you need the same naming conventions with manual tests  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) what happens when the test is renamed on the java side  \n14:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I see. I'll remove the \"test\" prefix from all the tests  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding the sync  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could do as I do for the Syntax Report  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and import once per day automated tests  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and remove tests that don't exist - or move them to a removed tests category)  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the syntax reporet I get the tests from jenkins  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SyntaxReport  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-rendering/lastSuccessfulBuild/testReport/api/xml?xpath=//suite/case/className%5Btext()%20=%20'org.xwiki.rendering.test.cts.RenderingTest'%5D/..&wrapper=root  \n14:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I'll have to take a look on how you did it  \n14:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so the only technical name of a test should be in the automated Test Link ? (assuming the test is also automated)  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all rendering tests for ex: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-rendering/lastSuccessfulBuild/testReport/api/xml?xpath=//suite/case/className/..&wrapper=root  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only difficult part is that we don't have extra metadata for tests  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this was my issue too for the syntax report so I had to provide extra metadata like test description, etc)  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway forget that FTM  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should focus on manual tests IMO  \n14:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, I am going to start to rename them, remove the \"test\" prefix, add spaces, make them user friendly  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you list automated tests you need to keep the link to the test somehow  \n14:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, this was the part I still need to think about it  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the very minimum is <class>.<test name>  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not exactly enough but a good first approximation)  \n14:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I was thinking I should put the full URL to github where the test method is located. At least this is how I imagined it  \n14:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but again, if we move a test ....  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's even better  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why the test import is a good solution IMO  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0full class name + test name is enough actually  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you have that in the jenkins data  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-rendering/lastSuccessfulBuild/testReport/api/xml?xpath=//suite/case/className/..&wrapper=root  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<className>org.xwiki.rendering.block.BlockTest</className>  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<name>testInsertChildBefore</name>  \n14:44\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I see. looks as a nice automated solution, which is good  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we need to question whether it's useful to see all automated tests listed or not  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whether it's worht it  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and what's our goal  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me the goal is that manual tests must not redo what automated tests do, that's all  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure listing them all achieves this or helps that mich  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*much  \n14:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I agree  \n14:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0My goal is to see which test is NOT automated so I can write an automated test for it :)  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but listing all existing tests won't help  \n14:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0i agree  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO you should start by listing only manual tests  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't bother with automated tests  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just add a link to all automated test reports  \n14:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm sure we can have that easily with our nemo instance  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's another story)  \n14:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n14:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, so to summarize, for the moment the next steps are:  \n14:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a01) Fix the not logged user having the \"Add Test\" button  \n14:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a02) Remove the \"test\" prefix from tests and make tem prettier  \n14:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a03) For automated tests, add link to All Automated Tests Reports from Jenkins  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) no  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a lot more general  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0everywhere  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex the \"management\" button too  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0etc  \n14:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are lots of places  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd say remove automated tests for 3)  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you can move them to another hidden space if you don't want to loose your work in case it's useful someday  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0)  \n14:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so effectively remove the automated tests from the application ?  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n14:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so they don't show up anymore ?  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're not useful right now  \n14:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, got it  \n14:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ther eis only one thing. some of them might fail on IE browsers for example, this is why I decided not to remove them in the first place  \n14:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0because all the automated run on FF, but maybe we want to test them on IE9  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0makes sense  \n14:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0and there is a possibility they will fail on IE9..  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then keep them  \n14:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just add a field to link them  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to the automated test then  \n14:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n14:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so overall are you happy about it ?  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't know yet  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0haven't used it  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so far it's not useful  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's not been used yet  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll wait for my judgment till I see it used for real :)  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's promising  \n14:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: I've used it for 2 full tests  \n14:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0don't start using it yet, because I have to modify the test names.
