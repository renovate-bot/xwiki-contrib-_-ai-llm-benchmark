Does it always display HTML?  \n01:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think doc.display() is always supposed to generate HTML ATM  \n01:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually yes  \n01:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I think you're right  \n01:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0// If we're in new rendering engine we want to wrap the HTML returned by displayView() in  \n01:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0// a {{html/}} macro so that the user doesn't have to do it.  \n01:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Just mailto:asd will fail to work unless it's displayed in a context that does interpret wiki markup  \n01:42\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Then, if you do generate <a href=\"mailto: will the wiki syntax add a second link?  \n01:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reason it works ATM is because of this test:  \n01:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if (isInRenderingEngine && !is10Syntax(wrappingSyntaxId)  \n01:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&& (result.indexOf(\"<\") != -1 || result.indexOf(\">\") != -1)) {  \n01:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we don't have any < and >  \n01:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus not {{html}} is added  \n01:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/not/no  \n01:42\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Right  \n01:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll try to see if it works  \n01:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Gotta go  \n01:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I hope I won't break anything else\u2026high risk...  \n01:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n01:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Bye  \n01:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: when you have some time another day  \n01:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to talk to you to see how things are going  \n01:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bfn  \n02:25\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n02:38\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n02:58\u00a0<sdumitriu2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n03:00\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n03:11\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n03:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n03:13\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n03:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n03:15\u00a0<sdumitriu2>\u00a0has quit  \n03:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n03:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n03:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n03:20\u00a0<sdumitriu2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n03:21\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n05:21\u00a0<sdumitriu2>\u00a0has quit  \n05:21\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n06:46\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n06:49\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n06:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:06\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:14\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n07:36\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:31\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n08:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:03\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:56\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:01\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:05\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:04\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:01\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0hi  \n17:48\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0please, What's the diff btw <xwikidoc version=\"1.1\"> and <xwikidoc> ?
