After the first step of installing the UI if I click continue I'm taken directly to the homepage (http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome). I can't choose the upgrade mode in step 2  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: hmm you should be able I think but maybe it keeps what you answer during 5.0.3 install  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n11:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0this happened for both 5.0.3 and 5.1m2  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: you did not get it when install from scratch ?  \n11:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0from scratch I never get it  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so basically you never get it whatever you do ?  \n11:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0yup  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's definitely a bug  \n11:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0on previous versions I got it on a similar environment  \n11:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0when upgrading a version with 3 subwikis  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it works in 5.0.2 and is broken in 5.0.3  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0?  \n11:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0no. I meant when I upgraded from 5.0.1 to 5.0.2  \n11:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0as an example  \n11:09\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I don't remember exactly  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes so you have it in 5.0.2  \n11:09\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I think so, yeah  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway, could you create an issue with detailed step by step and I will fix it  \n11:10\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0sure, it's just that it reproduces on the latest snap. I'm going to also try on m2  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: anyway you said you don't get it in 5.0.3 so that's definitely a bug  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should always have it when you install a new instance with DW  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is weird is that I'm pretty sure I saw it last time I did a 5.0.2 -> 5.0.3 upgrade  \n11:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0you mean when I clean install from the war ? not on upgrades ?  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes what I asked you as \"install from scratch\"  \n11:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0then that's a old bug...  \n11:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0an\\*  \n11:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: old how ?
