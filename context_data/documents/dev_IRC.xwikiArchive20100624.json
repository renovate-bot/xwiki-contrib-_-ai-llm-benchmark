If code starts out as one big method, then as it grows it gets broken off into other methods, then they become inner classes and finally the classes are promoted to .java files, no code ends up in production without multiple revisions and having been used, revised and used again.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:15): Code which has seen real use and been revised is less likely to have extension points which later on prove useless.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:17): Also if a coder doesn't think about extensibility and cleanliness until after the first prototype runs, the space of time between the eureka moment and running code is shorter.  \nvmassol - (09:20): I wouldn't like that\u2026. :)  \nvmassol - (09:21): But  \nvmassol - (09:21): components are there to hide implementation details  \nvmassol - (09:21): and anything in the internal package is internal  \nvmassol - (09:21): so you're just talking about putting stuff internally first before exposing it  \nvmassol - (09:21): and this I agree  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:22): I write a lot of messy code, it never leaves my computer.  \nvmassol - (09:22): it's surely safer to open apis on need basis rather than too early  \nvmassol - (09:22): CalebJamesDeLisl: you can commit it in the sandbox :)  \nvmassol - (09:22): if you want to see messy code look at xwiki-core  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:22): I did :)  \nvmassol - (09:22): and look at how hard it is to maintain/evolve it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:23): Something I noticed in xwiki-core was there were extension points which were never used so it's clear that the developer \\_tried\\_ to do it right.  \nvmassol - (09:24): there are ad-hoc extensions points everywhere  \nvmassol - (09:24): with hacks over hacks  \nvmassol - (09:24): to provide extensibility  \nvmassol - (09:24): and to take care of all use cases  \nvmassol - (09:24): but \\*without\\* having done any refactoring  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:24): I agree with you about apis, they are difficult to deal with.  \nvmassol - (09:24): as a consequence it's a big ball of mud  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:24): Yes, refactoring is key.  \nvmassol - (09:25): the key is the refactoring  \nvmassol - (09:25): yep  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:25): I am partial to the concept of spiral development I guess.  \nvmassol - (09:25): I also like iterative dev  \nvmassol - (09:26): but I don't see it as the opposite of clean dev  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:27): Well I see the problem with clean from the start development is that you don't know what you will need later so the developer tries to guess where extension points will be needed.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:28): My whole concept breaks down when multiple developers are working on the same piece of code (xwiki-core) because they are all afraid of breaking something.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:31): Something I find neat is how community development leads to modularity if for no other reason because nobody wants to break other people's code.  \nvmassol - (09:31): it's never clean from the start  \nvmassol - (09:31): but it can be thought out at a minimum level  \nvmassol - (09:31): you'll make mistakes anyway  \nvmassol - (09:32): but having cleaniness at heart will lead to better solution when you refactor the second time  \nvmassol - (09:32): and more importantly  \nvmassol - (09:32): it allows others to participate  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:33): Others are pretty well locked out until the code has undergone a few iterations.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:33): (in my model)  \nsburjan - (09:39): hello vmassol  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:39  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:49): Now that Dirtree has some semblance of stability, I'm doing stuff that I was putting off because it was a pain before.

I have an issue if someone has a bit of time to look at it. I've added an application icon to the new \u00a0invitation page http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/InvitationApplication; The issue is the icon will not show up in the bundled applications list on the Enterprise Features page http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Features  \nsilviar - (10:02): I think this has something to do with the fact that the new app page is in 2.0 Syntax  \nsilviar - (10:02): as opposed to the other pages which are still in 1.0  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:03): Hmm. let me take a look. I wrote it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:03): Nice icon.  \nsilviar - (10:03): thanks  \nvmassol - (10:04): the image is missing the url for some reason  \nvmassol - (10:04): silviar: you have invitation.png  \nvmassol - (10:04): instead of the full url  \nvmassol - (10:04): let me check the other pages  \nvmassol - (10:05): yes that's why  \nvmassol - (10:05): you need a URL  \nvmassol - (10:05): I don't know if it's supported but it should be computed with velocity ideally  \nvmassol - (10:05): let me check if it works  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:06): Ahh yes, when I wrote the 2.0 version I was making it \"so easy\" by appending the content to \"attack:\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:06): s/attack:/attach:  \nsilviar - (10:06): i've added the url, but the problem persists  \nsilviar - (10:07): last time i fixed this by changing the page to 1.0 syntax for the annotations app page  \nvmassol - (10:07): silviar: nope  \nvmassol - (10:07): :)  \nvmassol - (10:07): it's fixed  \nvmassol - (10:07): it's just that this page has a cache  \nsilviar - (10:07): ok :)  \nsilviar - (10:07): so that was it  \nvmassol - (10:07): to refresh pages with a cache you need to suffix the url with ?refresh=1  \nsilviar - (10:07): thanks  \nvmassol - (10:08): CalebJamesDeLisl: hmmm not much we can do to prevent having to put a full URL right now  \nvmassol - (10:08): since attach will only support absolute URL FTM  \nvmassol - (10:08): so using $xwiki.getDocument(\u2026).getURL(\u2026) will not work  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:09): I think the fix is going to break the other page until someone changes the classSheet  \nvmassol - (10:09): silviar: don't change pages to 1.0 syntax!  \nvmassol - (10:10): we want the opposite :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:10): Ok, I used \"image:\" so it still works with the full URL. Good.  \nsilviar - (10:11): yes, i know :)  \nsburjan - (10:12): Does anybody have any Idea when the multilanguage problem will be fixed ? the one that shows all available languages even if the user enabled 3  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:13): hah, I capitalize Idea too.  \nvmassol - (10:13): sburjan: nobody expressed interest so far in fixing this AFAIK  \nvmassol - (10:15): CalebJamesDeLisl: some failing tests for you: http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/990/testReport/  \nvmassol - (10:15): hmm sergiu hasn't fixed the object editor yet  \nvmassol - (10:15): :(  \nvmassol - (10:16): another day lost for the release  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:16): That looks like the flicker we were talking about.

We enable them again? We'll need to decide who fixes them  \nsburjan - (10:20): how can a fiber break ?  \nvmassol - (10:20): sburjan: put an elephant on it  \nvmassol - (10:20): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:21): or a tree branch. Or an incompetent backhoe operator.  \ntmortagne - (10:21): vmassol: i don't plan to disable them, they should be blocker for the RC  \nsburjan - (10:21): i know optic-fiber is buried  \nvmassol - (10:21): tmortagne: oh ok, I understood wrongly your message  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:21): Not in my town, it runs along the phone lines.  \nsburjan - (10:22): i understand  \ntmortagne - (10:22): vmassol: i said it's ok to release a milestone with them because they are minor but i don't need to disable anything to release  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:22): In my town you can't dig 6 inches without hitting a rock.  \nsburjan - (10:23): where do you live ?  \ntmortagne - (10:23): there is only one that will probably impossible to fix and that we will disable i guess: that's the incitation one that needs to be inline because of mails  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:23): woods  \nsburjan - (10:28): vmassol : when you have 5 minutes to finish the yesterday's topic please tell me :)  \nvmassol - (10:29): sburjan: don't wait for me  \nvmassol - (10:29): just ask your questions  \nvmassol - (10:29): but don't ask them to me  \nvmassol - (10:29): ask them to the community  \nvmassol - (10:29): whoever is free and has the answer will answer  \nsburjan - (10:29): ok. i'll try to be as short as possible. This is a question for everybody anyway.  \nvmassol - (10:30): just to be clear, there's nobody in charge of xwiki.org  \nvmassol - (10:30): I'm not in charge for ex  \nsburjan - (10:30): We have some portion of documentation that aren;t accessible from nowhere. There are certain pages that only accessible if you know the URL, but from the interface they are inaccessible.  \nsburjan - (10:31): i know, but you're one of the few who actually respond to my dilemmas  \nsburjan - (10:31): \\*isn't  \nvmassol - (10:31): sure but I'd like others to answer too  \nsburjan - (10:31): me too  \nvmassol - (10:31): so if you ping me nobody else will answer  \nvmassol - (10:31): :)  \nsburjan - (10:31): :)  \nvmassol - (10:32): what page? can you give an ex?  \nsburjan - (10:32): now  \nsburjan - (10:32): http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/WatchlistApplication  \nsburjan - (10:32): go to : Viewing the elements in your watchlist  \nsburjan - (10:32): on the bottom  \nsburjan - (10:32): you'll see there a screenshot with Remove from watchlist  \nsburjan - (10:33): that screen isn;t accessible from nowhere, but only if you know the URL  \nvmassol - (10:33): I think that screenshot is old now  \nvmassol - (10:33): since the watchlist is now in the user's profile  \nvmassol - (10:33): no?

 \nvmassol - (10:34): (jvdrean is the one who did it)  \nsburjan - (10:34): it's not a bug.. we changed the UI in thea meantime.. but forgot to actually delete the old functionality  \nvmassol - (10:34): entering call now, bbl  \nsburjan - (10:34): okay  \nsburjan - (10:35): so as far as I see, nowdays we don't telede the watch on a space, page, wiki, we click on the unwatch button  \ntmortagne - (10:35): sburjan: something that should not be here is a bug ;)  \nsburjan - (10:35): and this oldscreen + still existingfunctionality has remained  \nsburjan - (10:39): I mean... it's like we have multiple UI's .. but only one of them is viewable, the others are like hidden easter eggs :)  \nsburjan - (10:40): the problem would be that is they will coexist .. maybe they could break functionality and become some sort of exploits  \nsburjan - (10:40): and can't be found when testing  \ntmortagne - (10:41): sburjan: again this does not looks like something done on purpose and everyone agree that it's bad to have old lost UIs duplicating new UIs  \ntmortagne - (10:43): sburjan: jvdrean is looking at it (can't answer right now)  \njvdrean - (10:44): looking at it, indeed there's a page that should have been removed a while ago  \nvmassol left at 10:44 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 10:44  \njvdrean - (10:48): lucaa: looks like the annotations menu entry doesn't like the use of the watch entry next to it  \nlucaa - (10:48): hi jvdrean  \nlucaa - (10:49): it's the other way around :) watch menu is refreshing the whole menu when it's changed  \nsburjan - (10:49): okay, so I should \u00a0issue a Major bug on JIRA ?

 \njvdrean - (10:53): sburjan: yes please, the 'Viewing the elements in your watchlist' paragraph must be removed  \nsburjan - (10:54): ps: this is present also on xwiki.org  \nvmassol left at 10:54 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 10:59  \nvmassol1 left at 11:01 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:05): So are there any opinions on whether the invitation app should be linked from other places and if so where?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:05): On the one hand, if it's not set up then linking it to the user pages or some place will confuse users when it doesn't work.  \nsilviar - (11:06): jvdrean: I actually found the watchlist hidden page while fixing the notifications page on xwiki.org, otherwise we may not have noticed it; for the watch & annotations issue i filed this bug some time ago XAANNOTATIONS-9 ; feel free to move it to watchlist app if you think that's where it should go  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:07): On the other hand, that's the way the watchlist app works and it's linked from the user pages even if it doesn't work.  \nvmassol left at 11:09 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \njvdrean - (11:09): CalebJamesDeLisl: wdym?

 \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:13): Nah, getting there...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:14): Seems logical to separate accepted messages, and declined messages etc. So it will be a redesign of the page.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 11:15  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 11:17  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:22): How did saving ram in the velocity macros go? Were any changes made to the cache?  \ntmortagne - (11:29): CalebJamesDeLisl: vmassol fixed it, the change is that the cache is cleaned at the end of the page rendering process now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:30): So it doesn't clean when #includeForm is called?  \nabusenius left at 11:31 (Quit: Konversation terminated!  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 11:31  \ntmortagne - (11:32): no  \ntmortagne - (11:32): (no it does not)  \nsburjan - (11:42): who created the ColorTheme App ?  \nsburjan - (11:43): I have a question. I am able to change the ColorTheme from the Administration Panel, but I can;t change the ColorTheme from AdministerSpace. The field isn't there anymore. Is this normal behaviour ?  \nsburjan - (11:45): I can change the skin for a space (eg. put Toucan) .. so I should be able to change ColorThemes in Colibri too  \ntmortagne - (11:47): sburjan: i think it's not supported at space level or something  \nsburjan - (11:47): so only skin change is supported at space level ?  \nsburjan - (11:48): okay  \nsburjan - (11:49): another issue is .. does XWiki support user level skin change ? I found a document that states this, but I am unable to do ti  \ntmortagne - (11:49): (not 100% sure, sdumitriu would know better)  \nsburjan - (11:49): \\*i  \nsburjan - (11:49): okay  \ntmortagne - (11:49): user level skin change is not supported no AFAIK  \nsburjan - (11:50): thanks.

Everything in one table, sounds like bad news.  \nvmassol - (13:03): JCR doesn't say that.It depends on implementations  \nvmassol - (13:03): the pb with a xwiki jcr query manager is that the JCR specs doesn't say anything about plugging your own implementation  \nvmassol - (13:04): CalebJamesDeLisl: there are 2 differents things to understand  \nvmassol - (13:04): 1) using the JCR API  \nvmassol - (13:04): 2) using an existing JCR implementation  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:04): What are the advantages of JCR?  \nvmassol - (13:04): your code is independent of the underlying storage and standard  \nvmassol - (13:04): standard = you can change the underlying engine  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:05): Well actually it's dependent on JCR standard.  \nvmassol - (13:05): JCR is a standard and it's generic for any content app  \ntmortagne - (13:05): I guess that's the mail that made me remember something about JCR 2/query manager: http://markmail.org/message/o77ki3skmmpvpjgs  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:06): And some vendors will add optional features which we must avoid in order to be compatable, just like SQL.  \nvmassol - (13:06): CalebJamesDeLisl: you really need to have a look at what JCR  \nvmassol - (13:06): provides  \nvmassol - (13:06): it's 100 times better than what we ahve  \nvmassol - (13:07): I started listed the advantages for us on the new model design page  \nvmassol - (13:07): and I'm only talking about standard jcr  \nvmassol - (13:07): not anything optional  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:07): I read up on it a bit. The text was talking about the choice between jcr and subversion which is not very encouraging from a performance perspective.  \nvmassol - (13:07): JCR is like JDBC if you prefer  \nvmassol - (13:08): before JDBC you could still DB queries  \nvmassol - (13:08): s/Still/still do/  \nvmassol - (13:08): I think I put some links in the deisng page  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:08): Without jdbc each db would need a different driver api correct?  \nvmassol - (13:09): yes  \nvmassol - (13:09): lunch time!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:09): coffee time.  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 13:12  \nlucaa left at 13:23 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nmariusbutuc left at 13:27 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmassol - (13:31): still no sergiu\u2026.  \nvmassol - (13:37): guys seems there's a new version of selenium2  \nvmassol - (13:37): http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/seleniumhq/selenium/selenium/2.0a4/  \nvmassol - (13:38): I'm proposing to upgrade  \nvmassol - (13:38): ok?  \ntmortagne - (13:38): +1  \nvmassol - (13:38): I'll run some tests locally with it first  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 13:45  \nvmassol - (13:45): I still get errors\u2026. our tests are really bad I think since I always get lots of errors when I execute them locally  \nvmassol - (13:45): several are missing setting up preconditions  \nvmassol - (13:47): + even more important the flickering  \nvmassol - (13:48): I think this is not correct:  \nvmassol - (13:48): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0public void clickSaveAndContinue()  \nvmassol - (13:48): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{  \nvmassol - (13:48): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0saveandcontinue.click();  \nvmassol - (13:48): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}  \nvmassol - (13:48): we need to wait for the save to have been done I think  \nvmassol - (13:48): this is one causing flickering  \nvmassol - (13:48): I'll try to fix it  \nDSpair joined #xwiki at 13:54  \nDSpair - (13:54): Good morning all.  \nDSpair - (13:55): Quick question.

I then added a livetable to that document and got the following message and only one row of results : The environment prevents the table to load data.  \nDSpair - (13:56): Wait one, I found a mailing list post about this error.  \nDSpair - (14:00): OK, I imported the updated version of LiveTable application and now I don't get an error, but I also don't get any data displayed.  \nvmassol - (14:13): js guys, any idea why the following doesn't work for save&continue:  \nvmassol - (14:13): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0waitUntilElementIsVisible(By.xpath(\"//div[@class='xnotification-done' and text()='Saved'\"));  \nvmassol - (14:13): I also tried with:  \nvmassol - (14:13): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0waitUntilElementIsVisible(By.xpath(\"//div[@class='xnotification-done']\"));  \nvmassol - (14:17): this one seems to work though:  \nvmassol - (14:17): waitUntilElementIsVisible(By.className(\"xnotification-done\"));  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:19): you can do that in an xpath?  \nvmassol - (14:19): CalebJamesDeLisl: what part?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:20): and text()... looks wrong  \nvmassol - (14:20): yes that one might not work  \nvmassol - (14:20): I wasn't sure of myself  \nvmassol - (14:20): but the other one should have worked  \nvmassol - (14:20): no?  \nvmassol - (14:20): unless it's not a div  \nvmassol - (14:20): but the js source seems to suggest it is  \nvmassol - (14:20): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0this.element = new Element(\"div\", {\"class\" : \"xnotification xnotification-\" + this.type}).update(this.text);  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:21): Also if it's multiple class names.  \nvmassol - (14:21): hmm right  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:21): class=\"class1 class2\"  \nvmassol - (14:21): that might be it  \nvmassol - (14:21): trying  \nvmassol - (14:22): indeed  \nvmassol - (14:22): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0waitUntilElementIsVisible(By.xpath(\"//div[contains(@class,'xnotification-done')]\"));  \nvmassol - (14:22): works  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:22): hmm, didn't know about that one.  \nvmassol - (14:22): btw  \nvmassol - (14:23): this works too now  \nvmassol - (14:23): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0waitUntilElementIsVisible(By.xpath(\"//div[contains(@class,'xnotification-done') and text()='Saved']\"));  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:23): Interesting. I must have missed the lower half of the xpath spec.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:25): I read your page about JCR. Versioning is very nice. Still no language integration of queries, unfortunately.  \nvmassol - (14:26): regarding xpath  \nvmassol - (14:26): I was told to avoid it as much as possible in selenium2  \nvmassol - (14:26): because the xpath engine on IE is awfully slow  \nvmassol - (14:26): at some point we might want to replace them with other chained By  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:27): I have been avoiding xpath because it just seems like it would be slow. \u00a0Are we planning IE testing?  \nvmassol - (14:27): re IE yes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:28): Good.

It's called InfrastructureBackup and it allows you to add a list of Cisco/HP/Nortel/etc... devices which it will then automatically log into via telnet/SSH and capture the running configuration and back it up as an attachment.  \nDSpair - (14:46): I'll submit it for public use to wherever you would like me to put it.  \nsburjan - (14:46): guys, who crafted the PhotoAlbum App ?  \nDSpair - (14:46): I should say \"I'll have finished the first version\"  \nflorinciu - (14:47): sburjan: JV and Jerome I think  \nDSpair - (14:48): Right now it uses ExpectJ and calls to \"exec()\" to run local copies of ssh/telnet.
