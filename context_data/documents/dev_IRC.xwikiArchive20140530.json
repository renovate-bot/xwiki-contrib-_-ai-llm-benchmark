Do we have a \u00a0Converter for string \u2014> Type? (can't find one)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: any idea?  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: \"we\" don't but maybe beanutils does  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is a String -> Class for sure at least  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't seem to work for Type  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I can't find a way to use it from velocity which is strange  \n10:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think we are using it from velocity very often  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be strange that I didn't handle the velocity side  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I introduced the CSS  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't find any doc! :)  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(was trying to fix this actually)  \n10:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK you introduced this script service mostly to make easier getting the CM from groovy  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well right now there's no permission check anyway in the CSS  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes probabmy  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so not having to use groovy is actually danregous  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ATM  \n10:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not very hard to write a String -> Type converter anyway  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but that's a security hole  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we don't add some permission checks  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course we have permission check  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't forget that we have API taking class in legacy  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0se it would already be a security hole  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes we do  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it' calls getSM  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which has the check  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pfewww :)  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we just need the Type converter and we're good  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: if you are talking about getInstance method they are not public  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0your issue is not a converter issue  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can't use those method from Velocity  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(no idea why they are not public, don't make much sense to me)  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh they're not public, I was sure I had them public  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I created them  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm maybe a stupid mistake  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it looks like public method javadoc at least  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they were meant to be public  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but those methodes are useless  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have them in CM already  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"XWIKI-7839: Make Component Manager accessible as a Component Script Service\\* Add shortcut for ease of use for the main use case\"  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they are the \"shortcut\" I mentioned  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed the missing public keyword is a mistake  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they are not useless  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they are shortcuts  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree that the gain is not that big but well....  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah actuzally  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're wrongly implemented  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they shouldn't throw an exception but always return null  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in that case it's certainly not very big since you can't use them :)  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing them  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes in Velocity world it's nicer to return null and store the exception somwhere  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with public + return null  \n10:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0$errno  \n10:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I dare you xD  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: btw being able to get a Class/Type object from velocity is a security hole, that's why we have the secure uberspector\u2026  \n10:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you can't get a Class/Type from velocity, you can pass one  \n10:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to get one you would need a method that return one  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by the way even if you find a method to get you a Class it would be unusable because of the security uberspector  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n10:35\u00a0<bernar\\_w>\u00a0has quit  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: actually they are usable from groovy  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've tested it and it works fine  \n10:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0groovy can access private methods/classes/everything  \n10:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: should be made more clear then since when you look at the javadoc and see @since 4.0 you think your velocity code will work in 4.0 too  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep doing it  \n11:31\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:19\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki

pretty sure I know what's happening  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: each wiki has it's own classloader  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and related ComponentManager)  \n18:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok, is there a way to only allow certain extensions to be loaded at the farm level?  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have two kind of install when on main wiki, install and install on farm  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you want you jar to be in the root extension CL and root CM use install on farm  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/you/your/  \n18:13\u00a0<andreic>\u00a0has quit

and deleted the xwiki space and now everything is messed up. i tried adding the administration extension but i still can't get everything working the way that it was before and i'd just like to start over  \n21:45\u00a0<synth\\_>\u00a0i tried sudo apt-get remove xwiki-enterprise-tomcat7-mysql and then reinstalled it but everything is still broken  \n22:27\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0has joined #xwiki

what is the difference between a Workspace and a Space?  \n22:36\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0does the hieracrchy go Workspace -> Space -> PAge?  \n23:04\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit
