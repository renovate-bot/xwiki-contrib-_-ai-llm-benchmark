 \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because obviously the watchlist feature need to verify that the settings are correct for it to work  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it doesn't it's a bug  \n10:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so the watchlists should verify if the e-mail config is properly set before trying to send e-mails ?  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not the wtachlist  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the mail sender yes  \n10:09\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I understand your POV. makes sense  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and percolate that to the watchlist  \n10:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: this is not relevant, nothing prevent user from enabling the watchlist when mail is not properly configured  \n10:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0true  \n10:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I get this: http://pastebin.com/P35WyyPU when I import the UI xar on the latest 5.1-snap  \n10:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'm on manager/tomcat/hsqldb  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: I have nothing at SolrIndexEventListener.java:138 so it doe snot looks like the latest  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the code did not moved too much it sounds like an attachment event has been send and there is no corresponding attachment  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: I may have an idea why  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looking at it  \n10:17\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: ok  \n10:18\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0the import works fine, but whenever I see a stack I can't ignore it :)  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: and you are right  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that\"s what they are made for :)  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to not be ignored)  \n10:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: should be fixed now  \n10:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(if you know how to reproduce all the time)  \n10:24\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: ok. in the meantime I reproduced the slowness of Solr indexing. Sorin told you about yesterday  \n10:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: I have no idea what we can do about it, there is not much happening in XWiki side, 99% of the work is loading the document from the DB and Solr saving it in its lucene index on the filesystem  \n10:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I think XWiki's requirements spiked lately. On a regular computer, we have serious performance issues  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I think http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform%20Quality%20Checks/574/console is for you, sounds related to your rendering test framework refactoring  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cheking  \n10:37\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n10:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: working fine locally, digging  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I won't have the time, I have to leave in 5 minutes  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm travelling to Luxembourg starting in a few minutes to do a live recording of LCC at the YAJUG  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I won't be much available today unfortunately  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm back tomorrow around noon  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:04\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:22\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I tested XWIKI-9280 with a doc that has both en and fr translations. when I search with fr as current language I get one result; with en as current laguage I get 2 results. is that the intended behaviour ?  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: depend what result you get  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you did not undertood XWIKI-9280  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the point of XWIKI-9280 \u00a0if you get a result in french when there is no french translation of the document  \n11:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because when you go to the document you will see something even if there is no french translation  \n11:26\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: can you give me a small \"steps to reproduce\" tutorial so I can test it ?  \n11:29\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I gtg now. we'll talk later  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: adde detaild to the issue  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*added  \n12:20\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks  \n12:33\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:33\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n12:38\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I found the doc when I searched for it in the last step: \"search fr that document -> you don't find anything because that's an english document and Solr search UI search for french document only by default\"  \n12:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: then it means it's working  \n12:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not finding the document is the old behavior  \n12:41\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: ok. I missunderstood then. bug approved as fixed by the QA team :P  \n12:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: I tough the following was clear about what we want  \n12:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in the description of an issue you are supposed to indicate what is wrong  \n12:44\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I know. I just thought you were going to write a \"special\" step-by-step for me with the \"fixed\" behaviour  \n12:44\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0dunno why  \n12:54\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I am on \u00a0the latest jetty hsqldb build and I still can't find default documents. is this normal ?  \n12:56\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0you can't find the default docs and if you trigger indexing it looks like it's going to take an hour, at least on our PCs  \n13:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok maybe not 1h, but ~ 15-20min and that's too high for ~ 500 docs  \n13:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: did you waited a bit ?  \n13:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also remember that most standard documents are hidden and you don't find hidden document by default  \n13:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: 30 minutes till startup, \u00a0nothing found when searching for \"\\*\". \u00a0Also, $services.solr.getQueueSize() reports 0  \n13:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not \\*  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*:\\*  \n13:29\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0same  \n13:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: and you enabled hidden document in your user profile ?  \n13:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, I enabled explicitly. I was logged as Admin, I knew that for Admin \u00a0thedefault is to display, apparently it's not  \n13:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0not I have 15 results  \n13:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no it's not enabled b default even for Admin  \n13:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a015 is still an issue, sounds like only the modified documents  \n13:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not the initial documents  \n13:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0downloading latest snapshot  \n13:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0wdym ? 15 is too little, ?  \n13:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0most of them are \\*Class documents  \n13:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: yes I believe those 15 document are generated/updated document from Java and not existing documents  \n13:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I found what is the issue, debug leftover...  \n13:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it index only the first document in your version  \n13:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0cool, another bug catched  \n13:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: any idea why we don't have new manager builds ? I see we had a enterprise build 3 hours ago .  \n14:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I see http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Manager/job/xwiki-manager/  \n14:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it states 2 may  \n14:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0either I am looking in the wrong place, or I really don't know how to read CI  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Manager/job/xwiki-manager/ does not see XE as a dependency so that's why  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0someone used xwiki-enterprise-feature-authorization-context as dependency which does not make any sense  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fixing it...  \n14:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: one thing I don't undersant. Which of the projects/jobs generates the war file used for manager ?  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0someone totally broke this job configuration, it's a mess  \n14:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Manager/job/xwiki-manager/ build manager, I think it's pretty clear given it's name  \n14:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I still don't understand  \n14:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0you triggered a job now  \n14:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but the last run dat was 2 may .. and we have manager-web 3-4 days old, so who generated those ?  \n14:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0looking at http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/manager/xwiki-manager-web/5.1-SNAPSHOT/  \n14:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Manager/job/xwiki-manager-mysql/  \n14:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have two build of XEM  \n14:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0one to get hsqldb builds and the other to get mysql builds  \n14:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the mysql one is pretty useless now IMO  \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0removing it  \n14:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, but the wars I download have HSQLDB as default database in hibernate config.  \n14:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: not it does not  \n14:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it just has the default hibernate conf which happen to have hsqldb enabled by default  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't have the hsqldb jar in that war  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the database profile is not taken into account when building the war  \n14:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it's a mess in my head when regarding about CI. Do we have some page explaining the jobs, and what do each jobs produce on maven ?  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the job just execute maven, you can look at each job configuration  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I deleted the mysql one  \n14:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the jobs are the top horizontal menu from CI homepage ?  \n14:15\u00a0<sburjan> \u00a0 All Commons Dashboard Enterprise Functional Tests Manager Platform Rendering xwiki-portlet   \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the manager jobs do excatly the same thing as the enterprise jobs  \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you understand XE you uderstand XEM  \n14:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, then let's try to understand enterprise first :)  \n14:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0afaik managers is built on top of enterprise, right ?  \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0got to one job and look at it's configuration  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually the simplest is to look at the job last build log  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you will get the maven command  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those jobs don't do anything more, they choose the right branch and execute maven  \n14:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0my problem is that I don't know exactly whih are the builds and which are not :)  \n14:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand  \n14:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all the ci jobs are maven builds  \n14:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I know  \n14:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0some have test enable, some don't, some choose a specific branch etc  \n14:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but I can't read properly the interface. I don't know the interface. which this is what  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which interface are you talking about ?  \n14:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the one from the browser.  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what does not work ?  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's super slow but it works for me  \n14:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it works, it's ust that I don't understand the information from there  \n14:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0for example:  \n14:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Enterprise/  \n14:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0this has 5 jobs ?  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it has 5 jobs  \n14:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I can't create an app with AWM on the latest snapshot.

 \n15:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like Vincent seen this as a non content page  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(which is true) but it's an entry point  \n15:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not sure hiding the blog page is good, it brings some issues, I'll comment on the issue and on the devs thread  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I agree that an user entry point page should not be hidden  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not make much sense  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for me an hidden page you are not supposed to go to and are used by other pages  \n15:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0@devs: on which project should I report an issue about translations . The translations keys exist in french, but are not used  \n15:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: that's the translations of which module ?  \n15:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0for annotations, but the keys are in oldcore  \n15:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not matter and most annotation key have been moved to annotation  \n15:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0actually, it seems the keys are duplicated  \n15:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0annotations keys in oldcore are deprecated  \n15:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0no, wait  \n15:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0annotations keys are in 2 places  \n15:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a01) in annotation-ui module and also in oldcore  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: yes that's what I keep telling you  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the ones in oldcore are deprecated keys  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they have been moved to annotation application  \n15:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0depreacated means not taken into consideration ?  \n15:54\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, so I should create another issue so we move \\_all\\_ the keys from oldcore to annotations-ui  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0deprecated means deprecated, they still exist and you can still use them but they are not maintained and the right ones are the one in annotation application  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n15:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0bassically my issue is this: I have 5 keys in oldcore which have french translation. But when I switch my XWiki to french, I don't get the french message  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the fact that there is deprecated keys in oldcore is perfectly normal again, what may be wrong is that the translations have not been copied  \n15:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so what should I do ? shouldn't I report an issue stating that these 5 keys even if they have french translation are not taken into account ?  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case if there is translation in oldcore there is no reason they are not used  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if they are not used then it means the keys changed  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if there was french translations you would get them  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I doubt that's the issue  \n15:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the keys did not changed. the code uses the right key which I am able to see it on github  \n15:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\\*chage  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not change anything that the translation are in oldcore or in annotations  \n15:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, then I am going to report a bug  \n15:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0because we have the key, we have the translation, but the translation in french is not used. The english one is used instead  \n15:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0don't you agree ?  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: which translation key for example ?  \n15:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0annotations.config.type.explanation  \n15:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0check in core, we have a translation from this  \n15:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0in french  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0where is this key used ?  \n16:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/edit/AnnotationCode/AnnotationConfigSheet?editor=wiki  \n16:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0basically all the keys used by the $services.localization.render from this page do not work in french  \n16:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\\*none of the keys  \n16:03\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0are you able to reproduce ? I'm also on the latest snapshot  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like localization module bug to me  \n16:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the thing is that the keys are not duplicated ...  \n16:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so I can't explain why is it not working  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why do you say the key are not duplicated ?  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they are in the default language  \n16:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0at least these 5 keys I am talking about are not duplicated in both annotations-ui and oldcore  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes they are  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I can find annotations.config.type.explanation in the default language of the Translations page  \n16:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0indeed  \n16:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I was looking at the Translations\\_fr :)  \n16:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the localization module fallback on the page default language before checking checking for all other translation sources  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking in debug  \n16:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so this means we have key duplication ... indeed.. for some reason the translations from annotations-ui take priority and the ones from oldcore are discarded  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the key duplication is not an issue, what is an issue if that it's not properly supported  \n16:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, I remember that the translations from page take precedence over the one from JAR files, maybe this is why the ones from Translation page are used first.  \n16:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0and the bug would be that the ones from oldcore are not checked anymore  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the bug is that the localization module stop at first bundle that contains the key no matter which language is supported by the bundle  \n16:16\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, will you handle this so I should create a JIRA ?  \n16:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: I'm working on it  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:35\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n16:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: should be better now  \n16:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I'll retest tomorro  \n16:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0w  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I see in your test that you only add one translation (calling only once addWikiTranslation(\"wiki.translation\", \"\", Locale.ROOT);) shouldn't that be called twice ?  \n16:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually this test was not supposed to be committed  \n16:57\u00a0<Buddhi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: do you think you'll have time tomorrow \u00a0to debug xwiki's slow SOLR indexaction on my machine if you can't reproduce on yours ?  \n17:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it's BFD, I forgot  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: yes BFD but the main issue is that if you simply have a slow computer debugging won't help much  \n17:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I just want to make sure it's my computer and not something else  \n17:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:31\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:41\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:20\u00a0<AlexLuca>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:20\u00a0<AlexLuca>\u00a0Hy  \n18:21\u00a0<AlexLuca>\u00a0I need some help with my xwiki .  \n18:21\u00a0<AlexLuca>\u00a0Anyone?  \n18:26\u00a0<AlexLuca>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:29\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:02\u00a0<Buddhi>\u00a0Hi, has anyone here used the mobile client?  \n20:03\u00a0<Buddhi>\u00a0can we use InAppBrowser API in the mobile client to do what is done by ChildBrowser plugin?  \n20:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<Buddhi>\u00a0has quit  \n23:13\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0is now known as <npm>  \n23:38\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
