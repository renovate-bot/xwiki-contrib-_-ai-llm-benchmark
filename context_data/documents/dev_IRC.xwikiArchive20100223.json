I don't see anywhere where it says 'XWiki.BlogClass\\_Title' so I don't see how it could translate.  \nsdumitriu - (01:07): It should be automatically, without msg.get  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:07): So the prettyName is left empty and it gets filled in depending on the name and language?  \nsdumitriu - (01:08): No, it's not left empty  \nsdumitriu - (01:08): For the blog actually I see some of the translations  \nsdumitriu - (01:09): Blog g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (regroupe tous les articles publi\u00e9s sur ce wiki)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:11): I see it too. It seems static list options are translated but not pretty names.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:13): Does (or should) getPrettyName() return the translated version?  \nsdumitriu - (01:13): I don't know if it does, but it should  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:14): 'should' meaning will when this issue is fixed.  \nsdumitriu - (01:15): Yep  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:16): Okay, I'll go ahead and set up the registration page configuration the same and wait for the fix.  \nsdumitriu - (01:16): +1  \nsdumitriu - (01:17): You can create the issues for this, though  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:17): Sure.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:18): One more thing, I made 5 translation keys which are incorrectly named against naming conventions for Registration.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:19): released in 2.2 so I figure I should duplicate and deprecate them then remove them in 2.4, sound right?  \nsdumitriu - (01:19): Yes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:20): I am also going to make a point of asking about everything to do with l10n from now on, mistakes are too expensive!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:26): XWIKI-4923 Here's the issue.  \nsdumitriu left at 01:29 (\\*.net \\*.split  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 01:30  \nsematicweboholic joined #xwiki at 02:20  \nsdumitriu left at 03:00 (Ping timeout: 256 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl left at 03:01 (Quit: bed time.  \nthinkcad left #xwiki at 03:42  \nMichelleShi joined #xwiki at 06:34  \nsematicweboholic left at 06:47 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nMichelleShi\\_ joined #xwiki at 06:48  \nMichelleShi left at 06:49 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nMichelleShi\\_ left at 06:54 (Quit: Leaving  \nMichelleShi joined #xwiki at 06:54  \nhcross left at 07:36 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 07:46  \nhcross joined #xwiki at 07:54  \nMichelleShi left at 08:15 (Quit: Leaving  \nMichelleShi joined #xwiki at 08:16  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 08:29  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 09:02  \nanamarias left at 09:03 (Remote host closed the connection  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 09:03  \nMichelleShi left at 09:17 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 09:22  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:24  \nnpm left at 09:28 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 09:28  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 09:36  \nMichelleShi joined #xwiki at 09:40  \noxi left at 09:43 (Quit: oxi  \narkub joined #xwiki at 09:45  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 09:48  \nMichelleShi left at 09:49 (Quit: Leaving  \nplunden - (09:55): Hello.

Basically you can either create that class in a page and have user import that page and thus that class or create it from java code triggered at init time for ex  \nvmassol - (18:36): (if you want to always have that class in the wiki with no app to install)  \nbblfish - (18:36): ah ok, I though I should create the class in Velocity  \nvmassol - (18:36): not sure what doing it from velocity would gain  \nvmassol - (18:36): unless the class creation has to be dynamic based on something  \nbblfish - (18:37): no not really. So I just save the class and that's it \u00a0I suppse....  \nvmassol - (18:37): velocity means the code would be packaged as a XAR anyway  \nvmassol - (18:37): so you might as well package the class as a page too  \nbblfish - (18:37): ok  \njvelociter left #xwiki at 18:46  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 18:53  \nbblfish left at 18:54 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 18:55  \nanamarias\\_ joined #xwiki at 18:56  \nKermitTheFragger left at 18:56 (Quit: Leaving  \noxi left at 18:56 (Quit: oxi  \nanamarias left at 19:00 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nanamarias\\_ is now known as anamarias ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nlucaa left at 19:02 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbblfish - (19:02): in the xar there are 2 files always, one of them a packa\u001cge.xml  \nbblfish - (19:02): is that one important?  \nvmassol - (19:02): yes  \nvmassol - (19:03): but it's genertaed automatically by the maven xar plugin (if you're using it to generate the XAR)  \nbblfish - (19:03): ah ok  \nbblfish - (19:03): so all I need to put in git is the other file  \nvmassol - (19:03): yes  \nvmassol - (19:03): you can check ex of apps here:  \nvmassol - (19:03): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-applications/trunk/  \nvmassol - (19:03): for ex: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-applications/trunk/blog/  \nbblfish - (19:04): btw, I'd suggest removing the content from these xml files and puting a relative link to an external file, so that one can see the real content of velocity, not munged  \nbblfish - (19:05): then one can use editors that parse xml, html, and velocity  \nbblfish - (19:05): to check the content  \nvmassol - (19:13): interesting idea but it makes it not self contained and harder to manipulate in memory  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 19:16  \nbblfish left at 19:27 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 19:27  \nbblfish - (19:28): you could just add it to the build script to put them together  \nbblfish - (19:28): no?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:31): I like the idea too since I'm constantly editing the xml files, sometimes breaking the build. Trouble is, what about pages with classes and objects?  \nvmassol - (19:31): bblfish: ah you mean just modifying the XAR plugin and not the actual xml format  \nbblfish - (19:32): well, that would be the first step, least painful  \nvmassol - (19:32): only issue is when we export XARs from the wiki  \nvmassol - (19:32): we'd have to manually modify them  \nvmassol - (19:32): to extract the content  \nvmassol - (19:32): and put a relative link  \nglerouge left at 19:32 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbblfish - (19:33): yes.
