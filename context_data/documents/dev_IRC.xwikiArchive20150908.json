Yesterday we added around 4-5 issues I think  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: good morning, do you have an opinion about http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12327# ?  \n10:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: better to put it in templates/, no?  \n10:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0A)II then  \n10:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I should read all the comments  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you should ready Caty's comments  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we already have a place for resources in resources/  \n10:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I think I found partly what is wrong with XWIKI-12487 but it don't know pdf export very well so not sure if we recently changed something in the way we use FOP that would make it loads all the fonts in the system (which I really can't imagine how it could be usefull for an export) instead of using a specific one directly  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: hmm doesn't ring a bell. If a change was made it wasn't voluntarily (at least not from me)  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I mean I don't remember chaning the way we use FOP)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*changing  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does anyone has any idea what font we are supposed to use when exporting a PDF ? I think we have some open source font embedded in our WAR just for this but not sure  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe we don't put it in FOP configuration anymore or something like this  \n10:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe trying to understand why FOP is doing this I would need to know what it's supposed to do  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or so that's it, if we don't provide a fond by configuration FOP select one in the system (but load all of them in the process)  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I don't know if we are supposed to provide a font but we should really do...  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sergiu had bundled some fonts  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some related issues that could help maye:  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*maybe  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-2555  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-2578  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-2593  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7106 I see:  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"PDFs are exported using only FreeFonts, which don't yet provide support for CJK characters. \"  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this seems to indicate we use FreeFonts for exports  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: see my last comment  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I feel this is the only good solution  \n10:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0reading it  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so basically close the issue as won't fix and instead document it  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so from what I see we indicate FOP where to load fonts by default but according to the log in XWIKI-12487 it does not care  \n10:52\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, would be nice if you could reply to my last mail about the app best practice, so that I can close one issue more :)  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks!  \n12:05\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:24\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n13:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n13:59\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:41\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:56\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:52\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n15:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:29\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:03\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0has quit  \n17:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a011 issues open for RC1, good job today! :)  \n18:11\u00a0<Trefex2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:12\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: we have a page Main.Spaces (in enterprise-ui-common).
