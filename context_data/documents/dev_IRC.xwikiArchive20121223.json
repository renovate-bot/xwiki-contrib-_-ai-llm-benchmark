Is it possible to install XWiki on a shared hosting which doesn't support WAR deployment? I have such a plan, with a shared JVM and Tomcat.  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0LMolr: if you have tomcat then it supports WAR deployments  \n09:54\u00a0<LMolr>\u00a0vmassol, unfortunately, my hosting provider doesn't allow me to do so. I think it's an anti-feature for marketing purpose.  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do you deploy?  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0servlet containers only support WARs AFAIK  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at least I have never deployed in any other way)  \n09:56\u00a0<LMolr>\u00a0vmassol, I am noob in this field. Is it possible they only support jsps? does it make sense?  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't make sense  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the two are completely different  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one is a deployment foramt  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other is a type of file  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you still need to deploy that file  \n09:58\u00a0<LMolr>\u00a0vmassol, ok. so I need to ask further for the war deployment. I hope next support guy will be better than the previous one. Thank you vmassol !  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gl  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you need a hoster, also consider usign xwiki cloud or xwiki sas hosting (http://xwiki.com)  \n10:05\u00a0<LMolr>\u00a0vmassol, ok. The support guy is telling me this: \"Ian: Your current plan can have shared JVM where you can host only JSP pages .\"  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:14\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:17\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<LMolr>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:19\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:20\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n11:50\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:58\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:14\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:20\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n22:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:49\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:39\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:42\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
