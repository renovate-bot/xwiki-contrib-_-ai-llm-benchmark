I have a question  \n15:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I was writing a test and I need a method to get the Document Title, which doesn't seem to exist  \n15:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I have 3 options to solve this :  \n15:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a01.Create a method in ViwePage called getDocumentTitle()  \n15:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a02.Edit the page in WikiMode and get the Title from there  \n15:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a03.Use contains method in the Assert (not very elegant IMO)  \n15:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0we already have a getPageTitle() in ViewPage, but that will get the Title fomr HTML head, which is longer and has other stuff in it  \n15:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0WDUY ?  \n15:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*WDYT ?  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01 and 2 are valid, they're not the same use case IMO  \n16:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0nop.
