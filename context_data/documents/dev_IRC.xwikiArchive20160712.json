I was waiting for the ci to finish the build in order to start the release  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: it not very important but it's not dangerous  \n15:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n15:08\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0So, apparently XWiki is missing mass actions on livetable items. I was told I could script it, but have no idea where to even begin with this. Any pointers? I have a MediaWiki import gone 100% wrong that put stuff all over the main wiki space, mixed in with the XWiki internals.  \n15:18\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<Chris[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:34\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has quit  \n16:02\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:02\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<blabla2[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<M-vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:08\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I can reproduce http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/lastBuild/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-observation-test-tests/testReport/org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4/JUnit4Provider/org\\_xwiki\\_test\\_cluster\\_AllTests/ locally. Do you have an idea of what might have caused it?  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: currupted hsqldb database maybe, it seems to fail when trying to access the hsqldb database the first time  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but no idea what changed for this to happen  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it's the first time I see an error like this so not much experience on the possible causes)  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying to reproduce locally too  \n16:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the test create two instances in target, tying to see which one is bad, if not both  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: there is only one DB in this test  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0both instances use the same DB  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you upgraded hsqldb, could it be linked?  \n16:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ah, ok  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: no I did not really upgraded it, we were setting the version in several places  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: the actual database is supposed to in ${project.build.directory}/data/database in this test  \n16:36\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I can't find the syntax for org.xwiki.model.reference.EntityReference entries in a form.  \n16:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0comparing the hibernate.cfg.xml with one from a working instance, the diff is in the connection URL and some missing resource mappings (activity stream, instance and mailsender)  \n16:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8: see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/MediaWiki/MediaWiki+XML/#HImporteverythinginaspecificwiki2Fspace  \n16:37\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Oh, nice.  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: the URL is supposed to be different yes since it's a standalone instance of hsqldb  \n16:38\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0tmortagne: Is there a doc somewhere with the syntax for that? wiki: and space:, and what else? And is there a way on a specific page to get it to tell me its ref?  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's an old test so that's probably why it's mossing a few resource mapping but they are not needed by this test anyway  \n16:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed, uses hsql protocol  \n16:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vs. file on the other instance where hql is embedded  \n16:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8: the references are documented on http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model+Module#HThevariousReferencestypes and you need to add \"wiki:\" or \"space:\" depending on type of the reference you are providing  \n16:41\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Awesome. Thanks.  \n16:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: I don't see anything wrong in data/database but It's not like I know much about hsqldb format  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: in any case it's definitely a test issue and not a XWiki one, I will take care of this and you can continue the release I think  \n16:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'll go on with the release then  \n16:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n16:43\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hello, FYI, on this old extension page http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Chronopolys, the page display lot of \"Failed to execute the [velocity] macro.

I need to try that!  \n17:08\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0it... looks like it works, but the model isn't actual updated.  \n17:08\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0actually\\*  \n17:08\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0and it allows things that don't \\*actually\\* work in the wiki, things like \"take these documents, and move them to this other wiki in the farm\"  \n17:09\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0like, you can drag-and-drop it, and it looks like it could work, but it snaps back.  \n17:09\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0in the case of delete, it removes them from the list directly, and that's fine.  \n17:09\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0except... after a refresh it's all back.  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I was surprised that it was implemented  \n17:13\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0well the view is.
