( http://maven.xwiki.org/site/xwiki-core-parent/xwiki-core/apidocs/com/xpn/xwiki/api/Document.html )  \n13:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess that is because platform did not build - should be back soon (I \u00a0hope)  \n13:29\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I see adding a new input widget in the macro editor dialog is not possible due to GWT constraints, but is there any hope to get an event handler hooked in that might transform a \"normal\" input field into something with e.g. autocompletion ?  \n13:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's weird http://maven.xwiki.org/site/xwiki-core-parent/xwiki-core/apidocs/com/xpn/xwiki/api/Document.html does not looks like the right API  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the API reference navigator is supposed to look at maven.xwiki.org/site/docs/ AFAIK  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: from where did you get this URL  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK this is vey old try of maven site plugin that have not been updated in years  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should look at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/SRD/Navigation?xpage=embed instead (we really need to update it btw)  \n14:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: for example platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \n14:04\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0and thanks for the SRD  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting is very wrong then, updating it  \n14:05\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0great :)  \n14:05\u00a0<sbaloul2>\u00a0has quit  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the best especially for Velocity is usually the SRD since you have the velocity syntax to call each service  \n14:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh yeah, IIRC I set Scripting to use maven/site way back when maven/site was up to date because it has links into the private API :)  \n14:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't really have any javadoc generated for snapshot anymore, I should probably put a link to the SRD instead of a link of the direct link on all those objects  \n14:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0make more sense anyway since there is not much chance someone reading that documentation is working on SNAPSHOT  \n14:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think we stopped building maven/site because it used up all memory ever and crashed  \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO generating this site for SNAPSHOT was not very usefull anyway  \n14:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah  \n14:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it tool like 8 hours last time it ran too  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0done  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but what we need to improve is having a more accurate SRD, like automaticlally updated as part of the release process  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since it's not fully up to date right now for example  \n14:40\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Hi there :)  \n15:00\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: hi, after updating multiple subwikis via distribution wizard, i thought of \"Continue for all\" feature for extensions... does anything like that exists? (or \"update as previous\" for subwikis -> you migrate one subwiki and all other subwikis gets updated with same params as the first one)... it gets annoying when you have to click for an hour to \"continue\" :)  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: there is no feature like that no  \n15:13\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ok then, i guess i will try to implement it this week :)  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok great, if you have question about DW UI the best is generally to ask mflorea  \n15:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ok great... i will look into on thursday, got to go  \n15:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n15:22\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Hi devs, I'm looking for a way to intercept creation, save and deletion of a document  \n15:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I Looked into the Javascript events but only found actions:save  \n15:24\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(I may have missed something?)  \n15:24\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I also saw the ActivityEventType.java file which seems to have interesting things but have no idea how I could use it  \n15:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0woshilapin: I guess you want to do that server side, via Observer .... me looking for the docs  \n15:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0something like that: \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/GroovyNotificationTutorial  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Observation+Module+Local  \n15:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Nice, both, probably what I need. \u00a0I will read it.
