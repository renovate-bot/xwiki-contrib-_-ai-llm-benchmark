 \n11:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0JonasBausch: yep  \n11:47\u00a0<JonasBausch>\u00a0but then it would be difficult to publish them as one single document or export it to pdf, right?  \n11:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no really no, it's a bit of a pain to edit it from main document but you can use {{include}} macro in your single document and it will be well supported by display and pdf export  \n11:49\u00a0<JonasBausch>\u00a0the problem is, that future users of my xwiki are DAUs, they won't use it if it's too complicated^^  \n11:49\u00a0<JonasBausch>\u00a0the best would be a dropdownlist on each section, where the user can give access-rights  \n11:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0problem is that there is no way at platform level to associate right to sections  \n11:51\u00a0<JonasBausch>\u00a0yeah, the problem is, that sections aren't actual objects, they're just formatted richtext  \n11:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0include macro is easy to use but it's a lot more painfull to setup right for all document merge into one than having a UI to directly associate right on sections  \n11:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n11:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0now you could always write a right UI which is taking into account include macro found in the document and present it like if it was right associated to section ;)  \n11:53\u00a0<JonasBausch>\u00a0alright, thank you for the answer, I'll check that with my customer, if this function is mandatory  \n11:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but that's a bit of work  \n11:53\u00a0<JonasBausch>\u00a0have a nice day  \n11:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0JonasBausch: you'r welcome  \n11:55\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0tmortagne: yes master  \n11:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jvelociter: sorry for the joke  \n11:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't have much idea, as I sayf the version is supposed to be in the root commons pom.xml  \n11:56\u00a0<JonasBausch>\u00a0has quit  \n11:58\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0tmortagne: I'll try building commons master  \n11:58\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0now I feel like talking to a sensei  \n11:58\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0:)  \n11:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0:D  \n12:14\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0tmortagne: works after building xwiki-commons-pom locally  \n12:14\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0master  \n12:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's weird it should have downloaded it  \n12:15\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yep it's odd  \n12:15\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0I think it's the second time this happen to me  \n12:15\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0having to build commons-pom locallhy  \n12:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maven 3.0.3 ?
