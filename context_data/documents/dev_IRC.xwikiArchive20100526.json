I have some code which works but I'm trying to be careful to avoid releasing something which will have backward compatibility issues when more features are desired.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:51): + there is only one test (I wrote this morning)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:52): \\* Getting something to eat. Will be back later and have some things to discuss re: ui-tests.  \nvmassol - (17:53): ok  \nfmancinelli left at 18:23 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \ntmortagne left at 18:30 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 18:32  \nasirir left at 18:33 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nvmassol - (18:43): nice what's new page: http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/whatsnew/?seeWhatNew#Bookmarklet  \nvmassol - (18:43): now we need to do something as nice in our release notes ;)  \njvelociter - (18:48): it's actually the upper part with icons that si great  \njvelociter - (18:48): s/si/is/  \nvmassol - (18:48): yeah but not only  \njvelociter - (18:48): we already do screenshots  \nvmassol - (18:48): the layout is nice too  \nvmassol - (18:49): and the text with screenshot below is nice too  \njvelociter - (18:49): our release notes aren't that bad. they could use some nicer styling I agree  \nvmassol - (18:49): yes finition  \nvmassol - (18:49): style + text too could be improved  \njvelociter - (18:50): the thing is they are styled as regular wiki pages. It's not always the best fit when you want something appealing  \njvelociter - (18:50): it's too much \"document\"  \nlucaa left at 18:52 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nabusenius left at 18:58 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \nflorinciu left at 19:05 (Quit: Leaving.  \nnpm left at 19:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 19:23  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 19:41  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:45 (Quit: Leaving  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 19:59  \nlucaa left at 19:59 (Client Quit  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 20:02  \ntmortagne left at 20:49 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:09): Back. I did a little more than have lunch. I efficiency modded and installed an air conditioner.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:10): What I wanted to say about ui-tests was I don't like TestUtils very much.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 21:10  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:13): TestUtils is full of static (global) functions and variables. I think it would be better if the functions were split between AbstractTest and BasePage.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 21:14  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:17): I would like to create a singleton object which holds all of the variables. A single static reference in the AbstractTest class can hold this object.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:18): vmassol: WDYT?  \nvmassol - (21:19): CalebJamesDeLisl: watching tennis on tv\u2026 :) I don't know, not sure I understand. If you can show an example with what you mean it'll help visualise it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:19): You mean write up some code?  \nvmassol - (21:20): or pseudo code  \nvmassol - (21:20): I always find it easier to visualise on an example  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:20): quick example: getURLForPage(String space, String page, String action)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:20): that's not a global function but should be a function for a page object.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:21): page.getURL()  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:21): isNewPage(String space, String page)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:21): page.isNew()  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:22): Have fun watching tennis, we can talk about this tomorrow.  \nvmassol - (21:22): sounds good in general  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:23): I'll start on it, so we'll have something to talk about.  \nvmassol - (21:23): k  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 21:25  \nflorinciu left at 21:56 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 21:58  \nflorinciu left at 22:01 (Client Quit  \nmflorea left at 22:08 (Quit: Leaving.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 22:17  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 22:38  \nflorinciu left at 22:38 (Client Quit  \nvmassol left at 22:39 (Quit: Leaving.  \nanna left at 22:46 (Quit: anna  \nfmancinelli left at 23:09 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nanamarias left at 23:11 (Quit: anamarias  \narkub left at 23:32 (Quit: Leaving  \nnpm - (23:44): Q: are there any 2.3.X releases planned?  \narkub joined #xwiki at 23:44  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:52): Vincent was talking about releasing 2.3.1, no set date as of yet.  \njvdrean - (23:53): npm: it's planned for friday  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:54): Ahh, I must have missed when it was decided.  \n\n"}
