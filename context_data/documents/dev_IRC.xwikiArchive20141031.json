I need this for instance to be able to call #template('colorThemeInit.vm') in a css file.  \n11:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm going to add a map parameter to the $services.webjars.url('/path/to/resource', {parameters here})  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what does it add?  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the webjar action won't do anything with it right?  \n11:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's the second part  \n11:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0adding support for evaluating velocity in the webjar action  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or is it just to benefit from createURL?  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmmm  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why is that needed?  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i mean  \n11:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, I should be able to do the same as with $xwiki.jsfx.use  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh I see  \n11:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0or $xwiki.ssfx.use  \n11:50\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ideally be careful to do something generic that will work with any future templating engine\u2026 was thinking about TemplateManager  \n11:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, instead of putting the js/css in resources/uicomponets (and load them with jsfx) I put them in webjars, and load them with $services.webjars.url, but I need to be able to keep evaluating the Velocity code  \n11:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I will do that jsfx and ssfx do for now. In case we change the \u00a0templating engine we'll have to update both places anyway  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0talk to thomas first  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to verify if TemplateManager is not the way to do  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can be changed later I agree  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and Template in TemplateManager probably means xwiki template files and not templating engine  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we might be missing an intermediary class for evaluating code using any templating engine  \n12:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: let me know wdyt  \n12:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:21\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:21\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0hello anyone there  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi  \n12:31\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0vmassol: hi,I am looking forward to contribute.I have fair experience using java. but havenot faced real-world java code.my intention here is to familiarize myself with build tools,CI and code review.I haven't been exposed to these tools any time before. what dou you think ?what will I get to learn here ?  \n12:34\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0vmassol: you there  \n12:34\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:41\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:41\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n12:41\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:42\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has quit  \n12:45\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:45\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0anyone there  \n12:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nope  \n12:46\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0cjd: can you answer my above question  \n12:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well.. mostly just have to be self-directed, xwiki.org has a lot of documentation, the code is on github, if you have questions and want them answered, start making pull requests which improve documentation in the code, if you're documentation is wrong them someone will help you correct it  \n12:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the trick to getting a question answered is to document what you think the answer is and then ask for corrections, that way helping you helps everyone  \n12:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rihbyne: nice goal!  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you'll leanr is everything described at http://dev.xwiki.org  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this site contains all this project's practices on software development  \n12:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0see how well that works, I just start giving bad advice and someone jumps in instantly ;)  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you'll learn a lot of nice best practices for developing software in a professional way, and in a collaboraive manner  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(rihbyne sorry, was away taking my shower and I'm now going to blow leaves in my garden for a while and skip lunch ;))  \n12:52\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0vmassol: thanks,what do I start with?  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this page:  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Contributing  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbiab  \n12:53\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0vmassol:whats bbiab?  \n12:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0\"be back in a bit\"  \n12:57\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0ClemensR: noted  \n13:24\u00a0<ebullient1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n13:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: the logic in TemplateManager is that it's the resource which indicate how is supposed to be executed and not the one asking for that resource  \n13:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: in my case the velocity code is in a js/css file inside a webjar. Can I use the TemplateManager in this case or can I simply use the XWikiVelocityRenderer component ?  \n13:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0TemplateManager main job is to find the template to execute, I don't really see the point of going trough TemplateManager just to execute Velocity on a content you already have  \n13:55\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0what does newcomer begin with in xwiki ? plugin development ?  \n13:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case you should not use XWikiVelocityRenderer either  \n13:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0better use VelocityManager directly?  \n13:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't need XWikiVelocityRenderer if you just need to evaluate Velocity  \n13:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes what execute velocity is VelocityManager  \n13:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0good  \n13:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWikiVelocityRenderer is more a component to use velocity in the old rendering engine  \n13:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's registered as a renderer like the goovy one and the wiki syntax one that's all  \n13:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWikiVelocityRenderer is really old stuff  \n13:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you already have the content the only thing you would get from TemplateManager is reusing it's syntax used by resource to indicate how to execute them  \n13:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but while in template there is always something to do which make ok to parse them everytime in the case of webjars resource parsing them all the time for the few that actually need to do something might be not so nice for perf, but then there is caching  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least what is nice if that the resource knows how it should be executed and you won't have to deal with that when you ask for it  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you cannot do mistakes  \n14:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I will start with just VelocityManager for now  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: about XWikiVelocityRenderer basically you should never use anything from com.xpn.xwiki.render package  \n14:02\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0on a different topic, in order to get the version of an extension that is available (either core or installed) I need to 'resolve' it right?  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the old rendering engine  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well yes the only wait to know what you have is to ask for it  \n14:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(I'm doing the thing we discussed about using the EM in the webjar script service to determine the available version)  \n14:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(instead of specifying the version)  \n14:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but resolve would search in remote repos also right?  \n14:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0one note, don't use \"resolve\" method if that's the question  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it depends of the repository you are checking  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is various API  \n14:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm interested only in core or installed  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the question is should you use ExtensionManager then the answer is no  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since ExtensionManager search in remote repositories  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it's not what you want  \n14:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, so I'll use the repo components  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should directly use InstalledExtensionRepository and CoreExtensionRepository components  \n14:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0InstalledExtensionRepository and CoreExtensionRepository  \n14:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0good  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's better to use specific getInstalledExtension API in InstalledExtensionRepository  \n14:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0got it  \n14:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0resolve throw an exception when not finding something  \n14:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is not great from perf point of view  \n14:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same for CoreExtensionRepository  \n14:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0oky  \n14:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you will also need to find the namespace where you want to search  \n14:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't really have a current namespace concept, there is the namespace for the current wiki, for the current user etc...  \n14:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends what you want to take into account  \n14:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can start with the wiki for now I guess  \n14:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, current wiki  \n14:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0o/t I'm messing around with ckeditor  \n14:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's beaurtiful  \n14:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*beautiful  \n14:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0write a plugin with 20 lines of code, CKEDITOR.addPlugin() \\*bam\\* it's registered, +1 more button in the editor  \n14:20\u00a0<silviar1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:20\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n14:27\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has quit  \n14:51\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0is bootstraps webjar somewhere available as project?
