I usually type in \"code\" in the Macro selection window, that is a little less clicks ... but macros have no hotkeys, as far as I know  \n16:26\u00a0<ImRGGG>\u00a0Thank for the answer ClemensR. Maybe there's a way to stick a shortcut in the wysiwyg toolbar ?  \n16:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hmmm .. with the current editor, that is the good old \u00a0Google GWT editor, \u00a0which needs java code to be extended ...  \n16:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0mayeb one can add hooks via a JavaScript extension ; the JS Api (beside more stuff) is here http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/WYSIWYG+Editor+Module  \n16:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the new editor is based on CKEditor and should be easier to extend  \n16:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is available as an extension, see here: \u00a0extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/CKEditor+Integration \u00a0but extensibility is fom the admin UI is yet to be implemented  \n17:02\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<ImRGGG>\u00a0thanks again for the intel ClemensR, I'll do with that :-)  \n17:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I hope you can get something working, ImRGGG , I guess it is currently not a trivial task  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:34\u00a0<ImRGGG>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0has quit  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:52\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0anyone know of open source wiki that is using markdown with support for wysiwyg and also authentication?  \n18:52\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0https://github.com/gollum/gollum is very close but got no auth built in  \n18:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0XWiki supports markdown and WYSIWYG but not at the same time (WYSIWYG depends on XWiki syntax)  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd@  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it kind of does  \n18:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh cool  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I coded the start of a markdown renderer  \n18:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0:D  \n18:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0excellent  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it works in the wysiwyg :)  \n18:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that seems to be a big deal for Open Source people  \n18:55\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0xwiki is not open source?  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup that's why I started it  \n18:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and for macros and stuff, you're just making it up as you go ?  \n18:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0M-oren: XWiki is indeed Open Source  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that works  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(macros)  \n18:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I mean the spec, you're just making one up ?  \n18:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0because markdown doesn't really have macros  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep we extended it, see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Markdown+Syntaxes/  \n18:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0makes sense  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you install version 8.2 of that extension it should work with the WYSIWYG editor  \n18:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0also OnlyOffice is really really good  \n18:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0been reverse-engineering this week  \n18:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a03mn lines of javascript, 38k lines of comments xD  \n18:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but I have not spotted a bug yet  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03M lines of js, wow!, I wouldn't want to maintain that  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's larger than XWiki  \n18:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0They have a definite process and they're clearly C++ developers from their style  \n18:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'd say they've been on large projects before this one  \n19:00\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0vmassol (IRC): it took me 2 minutes to click around until i found the github repositories. it would be valuable to have a link 'fork me' on the upper right side to github  \n19:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0unfortunately the magical converter which turns Word/Excel/Powerpoint files into their binary format is just an executable w/ no source code, there's an issue for this: https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer/issues/10  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0M-oren: you mean the \"Source\" button?  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a good idea: we'd need to decide how to handle more precisely the special case of github then, vs other sources, what to do with the button, etc. Right now this is a generic app that works with any source, not just github  \n19:04\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0i am talking about link to the source code  \n19:04\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0i didn't realize it's open source  \n19:04\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0it looks 'corporate'  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what looks corporate? the \"Source\" button?  \n19:04\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0not something that allows me to play with easily  \n19:05\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0the design of the homepage  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what home page?

 \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but indeed  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the fork me on github idea is good  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think Caty wanted that too  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remembe seeing at some point on xwiki.org  \n19:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah it's here:  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on the dev subwiki  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when you click on \"Contribute\" and then \"Development\" you get there  \n19:14\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0also installation should be 1 line - docker run xwiki/wiki or something similar  \n19:14\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0example: https://hub.docker.com/r/suttang/gollum/  \n19:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0M-oren: this is an open source project, feel free to contribute to make it better! :)  \n19:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FYI not everyone is using docker  \n19:16\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0WHAT?
