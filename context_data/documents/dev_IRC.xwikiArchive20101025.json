You can do this with a script if you spend some time to get familiar with the way the user document works and the scripting api.  \nbaur - (07:49): hmm  \ncjdelisle - (07:50): Actually you might have a look at the createUser function in $xwiki  \nbaur - (07:52): is this a correct path to admin document  \nbaur - (07:52): http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/XWiki/XWiki.Admin  \nbaur - (07:52): ?  \ncjdelisle - (07:53): http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/com/xpn/xwiki/platform/xwiki-core/2.5-rc-1/xwiki-core-2.5-rc-1-javadoc.jar/!/index.html  \ncjdelisle - (07:53): http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/XWiki/Admin  \ncjdelisle - (07:54): hmm createUser may not be that useful, it expects certain parameters to be set.  \nbaur - (07:56): i can set them by default, can't I?  \nrrodriguez left at 07:59 (Quit: rrodriguez  \ncjdelisle - (07:59): Probably not, unless you use javascript on the client side.  \nbaur - (08:02): if I transfer xwiki to a database, will all this information that is in the documents be stored in the database?  \ncjdelisle - (08:04): Yes but still in document form, you aren't going to get a user db table that way.  \nbaur - (08:06): i c  \nbaur - (08:07): i think the only way is to use LDAP authentication  \nbaur - (08:07): and import all my users into LDAP  \nbaur - (08:08): or create users one by one in xwiki  \nbaur - (08:08): :)  \nbaur - (08:09): thanks anyway  \ncjdelisle - (08:11): \"create users one by one in xwiki\" could be done with a script but might take just as long to learn the api and write the script.  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 08:11  \nbaur - (08:16): as far as I know, xwiki can support only one type of login uathentication, is that right?  \nbaur - (08:16): au\\*  \ncjdelisle - (08:17): It supports ldap through the ldap plugin but I don't know anything about that plugin.  \nbaur - (08:19): the problem with script is that my database is Oracle 9i, and XWiki does not compatable with Oracle 9i, it suppurts only Oracle 10g  \ncjdelisle - (08:24): Could leave XWiki in hsql (default db) and import the names still but you have to develop a script which is moderate to advanced scripting.  \nStulle joined #xwiki at 08:34  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 08:51  \nDenis joined #xwiki at 08:59  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 09:07  \narkub joined #xwiki at 09:13  \nsburjan left at 09:25 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsilviar1 joined #xwiki at 09:27  \nsilviar left at 09:30 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nasrfel joined #xwiki at 09:36  \nsilviar1 left at 09:43 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbaur left at 09:53 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:57  \nbaur joined #xwiki at 10:00  \nmarta\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:04  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 10:05  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 10:10  \nsburjan - (10:11): hello sdumitriu  \nsdumitriu - (10:11): Hi  \nsburjan - (10:12): tested the releases  \nsburjan - (10:13): only one thing I should note in addition is that windows installer (exe) starts succesfully only with UAC disabled.

If re-releasing applications is an option, I can put the config document in by default.

I have a very bad experience with this and latest Chrome 7 release\u2026 a blank page for any editors ! sdumitriu ?  \nStulle - (11:39): okay, i think i found a bug  \nStulle - (11:40): if you add a couple of tags to a page it will recreate all tags but the last one, even if they already exist  \ncjdelisle - (11:41): What do you mean by recreate?  \nStulle - (11:41): so if you have already creates Tag1, Tag2 and Tag3 on other pages, create a new page and then type \"Tag1|Tag2|Tag3\" in the Tags edit box a copy of Tag1 and Tag2 will be created with only one page having these tags  \nStulle - (11:42): and Tag3 will be on the pages you created beforehand AND the new page  \nStulle - (11:42): does the explanation make sense to you?  \nStulle - (11:42): so basically i'd be stuck with two Tag1 and two Tag2  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 11:42  \nStulle - (11:43): it only happens if you add more than one Tag at once and using the autocomplete feature does not help either  \ncjdelisle - (11:43): So you click on the tag and it goes to a unique tag even though it shouldn't be unique.  \nStulle - (11:43): indeed  \nbaur - (11:43): $xwiki.createUser(true) does that code create a user, if so, can I modify that function?  \nStulle - (11:44): i'll be out for lunch, be back in 30 min or so  \ncjdelisle - (11:44): baur sort of, it will create a user but the name is specified by xwikiname request parameter. see register.vm for more information about parameters.  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 11:45  \nbaur - (11:46): so if I create a loop with specified parameters and call this xwiki.createUser() then my users will be created?  \ncjdelisle - (11:46): You'd have to create an httpServletRequest with the parameters.  \ncjdelisle - (11:47): It's probably easier to use the api to create the user documents.  \ncjdelisle - (11:47): #set($myUser = $xwiki.getDocument(\"XWiki.$myUserName\"))  \ncjdelisle - (11:48): #set($myUserObj = $myUser.getObject('XWiki.XWikiUsers'))  \ncjdelisle - (11:48): $myUserObject.set('firstName', 'John')  \ncjdelisle - (11:48): etc.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 11:51  \ntmortagne left #xwiki at 11:51  \nsburjan - (11:53): cjdelisle: I fail to understand Stulle problem  \ncjdelisle - (11:54): I gather it means create 3 tags on page A, create same 3 tags on page B, click on one tag on page B, unless it's the last of the 3, it will think the tag is unique to page B and forget that it's also on page A.  \nsburjan - (11:55): I have done exactly this with 3 tags  \nsburjan - (11:56): and clicking on any tag lists the two pages  \ncjdelisle - (11:57): did you specify the as tag1|tag2|tag3| or tag1, tag2, tag3 ?  \ncjdelisle - (11:57): \\* tag1|tag2|tag3  \nsburjan - (12:00): I wrotethem manually  \nsburjan - (12:00): I mean afaik , is the delimitator  \nsburjan - (12:00): \",\"  \ncjdelisle - (12:01): He said he used | which is how they're delineated internally. Maybe that has something to do with it.  \nsburjan - (12:02): well if I write tag1 | tag2 | tag3 in the box, they are got in the same tag, they don't seem to be separated  \ncjdelisle - (12:03): ``then type \"Tag1|Tag2|Tag3\" in the Tags edit box'' Maybe without the spaces?  \nsburjan - (12:04): typed. they are taken as one tag  \ncjdelisle - (12:06): hmm. Non-repeatable bugs --> memtest86  \nsburjan - (12:07): I mean I don't know how are they internally delimited, but from the UI, the separator is \",\".  \nsburjan - (12:08): I added same 7 tags to two distinct pages. And they all work. By work I mean that when clicking on them, both pages appear as having the tag  \ncjdelisle - (12:08): Perhaps it's strange system specific escaping bugs since it seems like | is getting escaped for you.  \nsburjan - (12:09): me neither  \nsburjan - (12:09): so what you're saying is that I can user either , or | as a separator and should work ?  \ncjdelisle - (12:10): I don't know.  \nevalica left at 12:12 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan - (12:12): well I know for sure that | doesn't \u00a0act as a separator on my instance. But, like you, I don't know the default and intended behaviour when using the |as delimitator  \nStulle - (12:12): just to clarify, i used | in the tags edit in edit mode  \nStulle - (12:12): and i used , when using the [ + ] in the tags area at the bottom of the page  \nStulle - (12:13): either way, it fails in both of those just the same  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 12:13  \nsburjan - (12:13): well using , doesnt fail on my instance  \nStulle - (12:14): and for all i know tags should be sperated either by | or ,  \nStulle - (12:14): just checked the proper name of the box i mean in edit mode. it should be the document information panel  \nStulle - (12:14): using , where?  \nsburjan - (12:14): from the [+] button at the bottom  \nStulle - (12:18): well, it failed there for me, too  \nStulle - (12:18): will try again in a few minutes when i created a new page  \narkub left at 12:19 (Ping timeout: 250 seconds  \nsburjan - (12:22): yes, I think you areright  \nStulle - (12:22): okay, i think my generalisation was wrong... now I did it as follows: used the + and then typed the first few chars of a tag, then clicked on the auto completed proper tag hit the , key and did the same for the next tag  \nsburjan - (12:23): | should be also a separator  \nStulle - (12:23): added three tags out of which one was wrongly considered unique  \nmarta\\_ left at 12:26 (Ping timeout: 250 seconds  \nbaur - (13:04): if I create my own xwikiUser document like that: #set($myUser = $xwiki.getDocument(\"XWiki.$myUserName\")), will it override the existing users document?  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 13:08  \ntmortagne left #xwiki at 13:10  \nrrodriguez left at 13:12 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nStulle - (13:18): tried it again and again one out of three tags was considered unique when it's not  \nStulle - (13:19): incidentally it was the second of the three again...  \nmarta\\_ joined #xwiki at 13:21  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 13:28  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 13:38  \nrrodriguez left at 13:41 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nvmassol - (13:41): abusenius: hi.

I don't get Tag2 twice  \nsburjan - (14:18): odd  \nStulle - (14:18): but it still fails all the time. and in the tag cloud i got like a big and fat \"PDMLink\" tag and a tiny skinny \"PDMLink\" tag, too  \nsburjan - (14:19): that shouldnt happend  \nStulle - (14:19): i first noticed that like two weeks ago, shortly after i setup this instance of XWiki when I would have something like that  \nStulle - (14:19): i know it shouldn't especially because i am using auto complete to be sure not to make any typos  \nsburjan - (14:19): I actually created 4 pages with tag1,tag2 and tag3 .. and they only come up once in the Tag Cloud  \nStulle - (14:20): well, no such luck here, i am afraid...  \nStulle - (14:20): PDMLink for instance is on 20-something pages already  \nStulle - (14:20): i actually started working around this by just adding the tags one after another  \nStulle - (14:21): and while it works, it's not very practicable if you just want to keep typing rather than having to use the mouse all the while in between  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 14:27  \nsdumitriu - (14:28): Denis: Scriptaculous was used in the objects and rights editor at some time  \nsdumitriu - (14:28): But I don't think it's neededanymore  \nsdumitriu - (14:28): Anyway, I just tested on Chrome7/Linux and I don't see any problems  \nDenis - (14:29): sdumitriu: I use Scriptaculus 1.8.1 because 1.8.3 cause problems with accordions  \nDenis - (14:30): maybe 1.8.3 has less issue, but the scriptaculous.js loading mecanism in 1.8.1 with a defered loading cause issues with Chrome 7 on my Mac at least  \nDenis - (14:31): I get a blank page, and its content is just a head with several scripts elements loading scriptaculous  \nDenis - (14:31): I have fix this using defer=false  \nsdumitriu - (14:32): Scriptaculous has this problem  \nsdumitriu - (14:33): I specifically changed it in our sources to fix the defer problem  \nDenis - (14:33): this was post 2.4.3 than ?  \nsdumitriu - (14:33): Yes  \nDenis - (14:33): is it in 2.4..4 ?  \nsdumitriu - (14:33): Checking  \nsdumitriu - (14:34): 21st June, r29598  \nsdumitriu - (14:34): Should be 2.4M2  \nDenis - (14:35): I have this issue in 2.4.3, in edit.vm, and some others  \nsdumitriu - (14:35): Denis: Here's a patch if you want to merge it  \nsdumitriu - (14:35): http://pastebin.com/D9JVdc9m  \nDenis - (14:36): oh  \nDenis - (14:36): yes, it is on scriptaculous itself !  \nDenis - (14:36): obiously, I missed it since I use 1.8.1  \nDenis - (14:37): note that we were unable to have accordion working properly on 1.9.3  \nDenis - (14:37): 1.8.3  \nsdumitriu - (14:38): I know the accordion is failing currently  \nsdumitriu - (14:38): Doesn't work on the panel wizard, for example  \nDenis - (14:38): thanks for the patch  \nsdumitriu - (14:40): You're welcome  \nsdumitriu - (14:45): Dear voices, any problems detected with the build?
