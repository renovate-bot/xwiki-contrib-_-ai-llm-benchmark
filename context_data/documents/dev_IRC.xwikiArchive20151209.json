No clue what you mean that we should put :D  \n17:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but it is technically fully correct ;) \u00a0Hey, there are even examples  \n17:03\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0then all i need is one mapping to my case?  \n17:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0like using the URL from above  \n17:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i tried like couple combinations, nothing really works :(  \n17:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess what you want is having multiple roots, and that does not work  \n17:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0or what did you try that didnt work ?  \n17:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok, is there another way for me to somehow hide some ?  \n17:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i have a list of stuff, like SpaceA, SpaceB, SpaceC, Home, Sandbox, XWiki  \n17:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0the last three are noise, but could still be useful to keep  \n17:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0especially since the wiki home is in \"Home\", but shouldn't be shown there  \n17:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0before i had a small velocity script that was removing those entries ClemensR  \n17:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yeah, this i where I usually start to patch the XWiki/ DocumentTreeMacros  \n17:08\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0snief  \n17:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0because If you look i.e. in the debug console of the browser you can see the result is returned from a request to /xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/DocumentTree?outputSyntax=plain&....  \n17:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the macro has a flag to hide, well, hidden pages, but you likely do not want to make the \"Home\" page hidden ...  \n17:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: another issue i have, is that I created a new Page (Space) and picked the \"Dashboard\" Template for that, now my velocity macro shows the new space but with a ? next to it  \n17:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: true... that would be quite silly  \n17:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, but that should bot depend on if you use the \"Dashboard\" template or not  \n17:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0or is it shown on the new page itself, before saving ?  \n17:11\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0no this is after eveerything was created  \n17:12\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: here is my code: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/299148/14496775/  \n17:12\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i guess it's somehow wrong since it's referring to WebHome which I guess doesn't exist then?  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0WebHome exists as soon as you create the page, I am sure  \n17:13\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0then i dunno what's wrong  \n17:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but with nested spaces ... I guess that is the Problem  \n17:13\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://i.imgur.com/wHb31KX.png  \n17:13\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0this is the output  \n17:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0one moent, I try to check what \u00a0$xwiki.spaces does now  \n17:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0narf, I started the wrong instance, 6.4.6 is not much help here :p  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:15\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://i.imgur.com/XnPsOeX.png  \n17:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if \"sandbox\" would be made into an App, as it seems the decistion went, that would then be hidden from that view  \n17:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0how would i do that?  \n17:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0for \"XWiki\" I usually made a hard wired patch to XWiki/DocumentTreeMacros \u00a0- I know my users do not want to see it either  \n17:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, it would just et the \"hidden\" flag on the Sandbox, you can do that rigth now  \n17:20\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i hit the Hidden checkbox  \n17:20\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0but it still there  \n17:20\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i guess that's not what you emant  \n17:20\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah wait, have to tell the macro  \n17:21\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i guess the gadget can't set the hidden flag  \n17:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is set by default  \n17:22\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0doesn't work  \n17:22\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0still showing up  \n17:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and I have been worng, it is not enoguh to set the \"hidden\" checkbox on the start page itself  \n17:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the tree figures that there are subpages in Sandbox, to it still shows the sandbox itself ... sorry  \n17:23\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i also hid them all  \n17:23\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0still shows up  \n17:25\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0there's also a bug in the UI in my opinion  \n17:27\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0when you click the arrow next to the house you get the tree of the current wiki  \n17:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ow, really, it does :( \u00a0... I thought I can hise tio that way  \n17:27\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0when you click the arrow next to the current wiki you get the tree of the Parent Wiki  \n17:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is likely a bug, should be reported to the JIRA  \n17:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0with showing the wrong wiki, I mean  \n17:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yep  \n17:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0for hiding the spaces, it kind of blows  \n17:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0do you know why my velocity actually creates the entry with an \"?\" ?  \n17:29\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0otherwise i would just stick with that one for now  \n17:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0nah, I forgtot it shows attachment, too that is whi \u00a0it isnt empty :-/  \n17:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0no, I can only try one thing after the other  \n17:29\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0:d  \n17:29\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0:D  \n17:30\u00a0\\*\u00a0ClemensR creating a subwiki, trying to reproduce the issue with the parent wiki shown ...  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Trefex: what version are you using  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n17:32\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a07.3  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(asking since we fixed some issue for the breadcrumbs tree)  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I think it was done for 7.3 final  \n17:33\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0should i submit the issue?  \n17:33\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i am ready :D  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure go ahead  \n17:33\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12894  \n17:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n17:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: ok so two potential issues still to tackle, one is the ? in the velocity script, and the second is perhaps the missing feature of excluding spaces from the documentreee  \n17:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i guess for the latter one i can create an issue  \n17:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the (?) is becasue XWiki things the space path is for a single space  \n17:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it shpuld be the same for normal pages  \n17:45\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so my code is wrong?  \n17:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0no longer current so to say  \n17:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0for example in Sandbox you crate a Page \"Test\"  \n17:46\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah right  \n17:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0this page as the path \"xwiki:Sandbox.Test.WebHome\"  \n17:46\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0for the documentree macro, i created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12895  \n17:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and \"space part\" is Sandbox.Test  \n17:47\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: ok  \n17:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you look at the (?) link it tries to link to /Sendbox.Test/WebHome or so  \n17:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but now for the fix ... need a moment ....  \n17:48\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/wiki/lcsbbiocore/create/lcsb-sysadmins.Foreman/WebHome?parent=Main.WebHome  \n17:48\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it links to this  \n17:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(after rebooting a hanging build server here ....)  \n17:49\u00a0\\*\u00a0Trefex is fed up with servers today too  \n17:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0this \"$xwiki.spaces\" \u00a0is no good any longer :( it is deprecated anyway, but to find a better solution, \u00a0hmmm  \n17:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you know your user are not using '.' \u00a0inside space names there is a workaround, but usually sooner or later someone shows up using a '.'  \n17:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0very true, normally though, they now not to use spaces or weird chars, but hey, nobody is fool proof  \n17:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0can I not use $wiki.getSpaces() ?  \n17:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0or is that the same as $wiki.spaces  \n17:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is the same, and both is deprecared I thought  \n17:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but even for me \"@deprecated use query service instead\" is not really helpful enough atm :)  \n17:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/SRD/Navigation?xpage=embed here it's not marked as deprecated  \n17:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0is not valid anymore?  \n17:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0also how can i know the mapping between velocity and the java objects?  \n17:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0no, that SRD foir for 5.0 or so  \n17:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0for the current one see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/API  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah we need to remove that SRD probably now that we have the Scriptnig Documentation app  \n17:59\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the one on xwiki.org is only for 7.1.1 however  \n18:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and for local installs there is SCRIPTDOC-2 \u00a0blocking the use if it  \n18:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0what a mess :D  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note: adding jean simard aka woshilapin as admin on xwiki.org so that he can update the REST doc  \n18:08\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0that app is a blessing though  \n18:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: boah, so now we would have to create direct queries to fetch list of spaces? that sucks  \n18:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Trefex: yes I agree it sucks a bit, but just a bit  \n18:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Trefex: $xwiki.spaces is not gone, just deprected, and I see in t impl that there is a\"named\" querty or it  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0queryManager.getNamedQuery(\"getSpaces\")  \n18:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, this one  \n18:12\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0well it sucks only so much as it breaks my script :D  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because now you can use all the query manager params  \n18:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0nah it somethign else  \n18:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think I got it  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0set the wiki, set the starting index, hwo many items to return, etc  \n18:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0replace \u00a0\u00a0[[$space>>$services.model.createDocumentReference('', $space, 'WebHome')]]  \n18:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0by \u00a0\\* [[$space>>$services.model.resolveDocument(\"${space}.WebHome\")]]  \n18:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne would complain \u00a0that this is not really an API, but it wordks (mostyl) \u00a0;)  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0woshilapin is spamming us! :)  \n18:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/REST/  \n18:14\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: it seems to work! Not sure how you were able to get this query together, but it shows I could never really contribute code to this project :D  \n18:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is actually here: \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ScriptingDocumentation/?url=http:%2F%2Fnexus.xwiki.org%2Fnexus%2Fservice%2Flocal%2Frepositories%2Fpublic%2Farchive%2Forg%2Fxwiki%2Fplatform%2Fxwiki-platform-model%2F7.1.1%2Fxwiki-platform-model-7.1.1-javadoc.jar%2F!%2Forg%2Fxwiki%2Fmodel%2Fscript%2FModelScriptService.html  \n18:15\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0of course now it shows all nested spaces too D  \n18:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and you just used a method that had an explicit single \"space\" parameter - these are nearly guranteed not to work properly with nested space, hey just cannot  \n18:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, it does - it did so before  \n18:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0makes sense i guess  \n18:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0there was no nested spaces in 7.1  \n18:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so i didn't have that problem  \n18:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but before the links to nested spaces \u00a0were broken, now they are not ;)  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice woshilapin :)  \n18:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0what you want is a query that shows only first level spaces I guess  \n18:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0admin rights for 5 minutes, starts deleting spaces  \n18:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: ideally yes, but well i already bugged y'all too much again  \n18:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, actually I lean something that I should have learned in the summer, where nested spaces where in the making :D  \n18:19\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0you're welcome :P  \n18:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0a slightly more elaborate @deprecated for xwiki.getSpaces() would be nice, I still think  \n18:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I still try tofiguee out trhe right incantation ;)  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I agree ClemensR  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: perhaps i just delete Sandbox from the sub-wikis  \n18:21\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i don't need a sandbox in every one of them i guess  \n18:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0$services.query,getNamedQuery(\"getSpaces\") \u00a0seems not to work - it is not in the ScriptAPI ?  \n18:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, some folks just do that ...  \n18:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0to exclude it from the tree  \n18:23\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0created a app within minutes, can't delete it now  \n18:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0oh boy, what a day  \n18:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0why not?

 \n18:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is odd. \u00a0can you delete it as a normal space ?  \n18:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0\"Home\" should be ok  \n18:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, and my meddelign with the documenttee macro didt wor because I pated it in one wiki and tested it in \u00a0another :p  \n18:35\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0and finally for today, when i clcik on sub-wiki it shows the Home page, but on the left there is the Dashboard app which shows somethig else, how confusing :)  \n18:37\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: oh man i messed up, now i have two times my App on the left and I can't delete either, emergency help?  \n18:37\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0even a dirty trick to delete that stuff is OK  \n18:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, click in that app  \n18:37\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ya  \n18:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and then try to delete it as a space ... ah. one moment  \n18:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, at least not delete it as an app  \n18:38\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0that doesn't work, the ref to the app in the panel somehow stays  \n18:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i'm pretty sure it got fucked up with the name \"Home\"  \n18:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0check this: http://i.imgur.com/7aa6RR3.png  \n18:40\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so i can't delete the whole thingy  \n18:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok, worked, by deleting as a space, i had to remove the app from the panel using the Applications Panel Admin  \n18:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0that is a bug imho  \n18:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I try to reproduce, sorry, a light flue is really slowing me down  \n18:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0can you check if you have a hidden \"HomeCode\" space ?  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is where the application icon is lurking, I think  \n18:46\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0well I guess now it's gone  \n18:46\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0since i removed it from the panel and deleted again as a \"space\"  \n18:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, for me the application is not in a nested space ....  \n18:47\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0dunno what happened :S  \n18:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, did you create it in a subwiki ?
