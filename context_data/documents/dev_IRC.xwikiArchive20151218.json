But It doesn't \u00a0work when I retrieve my event with $request.getParameterValues('IdEntry')  \n08:18\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I thought I can pass and use $MonEvent.getEventId() but I don't know how to retrive my event object from event Id value (to use $xwiki.activitystream.deleteActivityEvent method after)  \n08:56\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n09:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has quit  \n10:24\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be nice if someone could reproduce https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12914 looks like an important bug  \n11:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:51\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has quit  \n11:51\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:38\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has quit  \n13:07\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:41\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:41\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that us: http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/05/07/the-truth-behind-open-source-apps ? :) I think we collaborate slightly more  \n14:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I remember someone said that the collaboration which works best is that which requires the least collaboration...  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure, if you can live with yourself that's the most efficient solution but not the one that gets the most work done  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0And then in breakingsmart the author pointed out that in a scenario of Scarcity, you need to agree on a forward path while in a scenario of Abundance, you don't  \n14:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and software is fundimentally abundant so fork and merge is a perfectly fine model  \n14:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but we are used to sitting in a meeting and deciding which way forward because this is how we did it all through the 20th century, when things were made of stone and steel, so we sometimes argue about what is the best way when the right answer is \"do both and let the users choose\"  \n14:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0anyway it's quite an interesting take on the matter  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we are in a scarcity model  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because there's so much to do and so few devs and little time  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now in OSS luckily we don't do too many meetings :)  \n14:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think the definition of Abundance is that the most expensive item is the attention of the developer  \n14:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0So for managers, that's still true but for people writing code, the expensive item is their own time so they are in a state of Abundance  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah if 24 hours per day is plenty then yes  \n14:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Abundance has a specific meaning, certainly computers and storage and processing still cost something  \n14:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Abundance means that the most expensive thing is one's own creative effort  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in an ideal world yes  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unfotunately we all have agendas dicated by others than us  \n14:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0That's how breakingsmart defines it (IIRC)  \n14:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Indeed so in business we still have a certain amount of scarcity but that doesn't mean everything is scarce  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only real moment when you remove this are the holidays :)  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you can work on whatever you wish ;)  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I'm holidays starting now!
