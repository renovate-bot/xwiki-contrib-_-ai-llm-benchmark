Does it check if the test already failed? Because if it is already failed, it should not touch it since it would otherwise make life harder to debug/distinguish the cause.  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: they need to be fixed. I would have fixed them if I had seen them  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that ci.xwiki.org is fialing all the time for me  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't realize they would fail for fnuc tests, fixing  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm having a hard time reproducing http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-rendering/org.xwiki.rendering$xwiki-rendering-transformation-linkchecker/171/testReport/junit/org.xwiki.rendering.internal.transformation.linkchecker/DefaultHTTPCheckerTest/org\\_xwiki\\_rendering\\_internal\\_transformation\\_linkchecker\\_DefaultHTTPCheckerTest/ Does it fail for you Enygma`?  \n14:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0did not try yet, let me see  \n14:18\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: can`t reproduce locally  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that I know why it's failing  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0kind of  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I've already committed 2 changes to fix it  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's indirectly caused by thomas's change  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when he changed the MockitoCompnentMockingRule  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to not mock Provider any more  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus the Provider is now looking for an ObservationManager component  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whereas before the code had a check on null...  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is why I committed the 2 changes but I must have missed it somewehre but can't figure out where rightn ow  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing the func tests right now  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll look at this after  \n14:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, but what about the logging rule, can we make it not throw an AssertionError if the test is already failed at the point when the log output is checked?  \n14:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so that it does not unnecessarily pollute the failed test's messages?  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I'll do that  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm modifying the capture listener already right now  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so i'll include that as well  \n14:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0cool  \n14:29\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0Enygma`: re AWM test, I reported http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11770  \n14:30\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0we either fix this issue or I will update AWM to use HQL (not nice but ok since that query is not complex)  \n14:31\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I guess we need to update the XWQL grammar  \n14:31\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0or something like that  \n14:31\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0to support Unicode in doc(XXX)  \n14:31\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I mean doc.object(XXX)  \n14:33\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I'm surprised no one has hit this issue before. I guess we don't create xclasses with Unicode chars in their name that often, but with AWM this is highly possible  \n14:35\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0+1 to use HQL in AWM and then probably revert it when XWIKI-11770 is fixed  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: done for what you were asking for, see commit just above  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now updating rendering and platform  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then i'll work on the func tests  \n15:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0cool  \n15:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0also, much simpler to use a property to skip the test :)  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n15:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0though we should not use it at all :P  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not that we want to encourage this ;)  \n15:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right :)  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I need this for the func tests  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for which I think it's ok  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'll need to think more about it...  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm rendering fails locally  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ResourceReferenceTest.testToString:46 expected:<...
