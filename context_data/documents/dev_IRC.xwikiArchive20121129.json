 \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not just xwiki.org)  \n17:32\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0yes  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch\u2026. another reason that we'll need a 4.3.1...  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it means I was wrong when I said that yesteday the panels were displayed ok  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is possible)  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:33\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0I'm not sure it's related to yesterday's problem on xwiki.org  \n17:33\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0since the panel was rendered, only the link target was wrong  \n17:34\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0(if we're talking about the same bug)  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no I wasn't tlaking about that  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought all the panels were displayed after the 4.3 upgrade  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we still have lots of xwiki/1.0 panels on xwiki.org ?  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably not  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's good we have some apparently :)  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt jvdrean found the issue with xwiki.org  \n17:57\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0I think I'm gonna go with a revert  \n17:58\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0a revert of XWIKI-8269  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it that bad?  \n17:59\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0fixing it would mean dealing with xwiki/1.0 in WikiComponents  \n18:00\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0for no added benefits  \n18:00\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0I think trying to use UIX for panels was a mistake  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why?  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it means UIX is not good enough?  \n18:01\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0it means UIX requires a syntax with a proper parser  \n18:01\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0which means a syntax that can be properly parsed  \n18:01\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0which AFAIK xwiki/1.0 is not  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I find it a pity to throw everything away  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you discussed it with tmortagne?  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since you're both at the same place right? :))  \n18:02\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0we're on the same desk so yes :)  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me the question is: do we want panels to be UIX (independently of this 1.0 syntax issue)?  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the answer is yes then the new quesiton is: how do we get there?  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(knowing that 1.0 syntax can still be here for a long time so let's not count on it disappearing)  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have a 1.0 parser but it's going to be making mistakes since it's just an emulation mode so we cannot count on this either  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what we discussed with JV is not to throw everything away  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jvdrean: will keep the generic work but for now will get back on the old way of dealing with Panels  \n18:05\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0yes, the question is, do we want panels to be UIXs  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0untill we get more time to work on it or we get rid of xwiki/1.0  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: if it's there but not used it's even worse  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0my idea was to keep it in a branch  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes a branch is better  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that still doesn't make it a plan  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for moving to it  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a good work but xwiki/1.0 introduce so much hacking that to polute completely  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so IMO the question about panels being UIX or not can be pushed later  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw what does jv's work bring compared to what we had? The ability to add a panel by defining a new UI extension object?  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not even  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0panels were still based on configuration  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since you can't easily get rid of that  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would have been a nice step forward....  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with the issue of ordering though)  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but fixable)  \n18:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but it's far from being a priority I think  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so no advzantage?  \n18:09\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0no real advantage  \n18:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0defining a panels in Java :)  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: so you're coding useless stuff? :)  \n18:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0I considered it as a demo  \n18:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0of the UIX mechanism  \n18:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0:)  \n18:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0\"see, it works\"  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a demo is sometihng that sometimes fail  \n18:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0\"well .. nope\"  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as we've just experienced  \n18:10\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:10\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so ok for branch + rollback  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just too bad you spent that time on it  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw make sure to modify the 4.3 release notes  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to explain this issue  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which means that 4.3 cannot be used in production for a lot of people btw....  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another missed release....  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well they can upgrade their panels but ....  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: the panels are not changed, it's a bridge  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I meant upgrade by moving from 1.0 syntax to 2.0 or 2.1  \n18:13\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n18:26\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm we could do a similar kind of presentation for XWiki rendering actually ;) http://mojavelinux.github.com/decks/asciidoc-with-pleasure/  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(thanks to fmancinelli for the link)  \n18:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:37\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:46\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:44\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:51\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:06\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:51\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:52\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:01\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:03\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n21:06\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:17\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:58\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:07\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n22:25\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n22:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:58\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:20\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0what is struts-form.tld ?  \n23:20\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0sburjan`: you know ?  \n23:20\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0zykes-: Delete it  \n23:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's a file that we've never used and was slowing down the startup time  \n23:25\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0http://paste.ubuntu.com/1397910/ < sdumitriu what can these things mean ?  \n23:25\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0That you're running out of space  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:25\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0In /var/  \n23:26\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0(disk space, that is)  \n23:28\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0thanks su  \n23:28\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0sdumitriu:  \n23:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
