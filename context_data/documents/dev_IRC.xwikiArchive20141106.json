 \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the manifest we have in the XE WAR is clearly not the one generated for XE itself  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(see the issue)  \n18:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually it's not the XE WAR which is broken, it's jetty/hsqldb distribution  \n18:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's during this distribution creation  \n18:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you tested with a jetty/hsqldb distibution, right ?
