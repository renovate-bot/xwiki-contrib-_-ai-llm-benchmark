BTW what's the state of the new attachment store? Does it have known bugs/limitations at this point? Can it be used in production?  \n21:29\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0No known bugs, needs further testing. Been distracted by cjdns. I think it would be a good idea to change the parameters in xwiki.cfg and add some more integration tests.  \n21:30\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0If there's anything to go wrong now, it will be in the integration between store and xwiki-core.  \n21:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdym by change parameters?  \n21:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm not sure about making it the default if that's what you mean)  \n21:30\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0set the attachment store to file so that automated testing is dirercted at it.  \n21:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we should definitely have some functional tests for it  \n21:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ldap tests change the config for ex  \n21:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can do the same  \n21:31\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Ahh, I was unaware that there was a way to change xwiki.cfg from selenium.  \n21:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not from seleinum  \n21:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but since we start xwiki  \n21:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can do whatever we want  \n21:32\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0If we change it though it will prevent testing of the old attachment store. I'm not sure of a way around that though.  \n21:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no no  \n21:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should have its own functional tests  \n21:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now we have about 7-8 different types of functional tests  \n21:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/trunk/distribution-test/  \n21:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can add another dir there for the new attachment store for ex  \n21:34\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok and add a new class of functional tests which will be applied both to the new store and the old?  \n21:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah you want to share the same tests for both is that it?  \n21:35\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0it makes sense to test them both then we can compare them.  \n21:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we can do that  \n21:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n21:35\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I have some tests on cjdns where I had to prove my parser was the same as the ball of mud it replaced, that's what I did.  \n21:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be a maven profile or we stop and restart the container in 2 different test suites  \n21:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's easy to do actually  \n21:36\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0What is the secret so I can write it down and I don't have to spend a day digging through maven documentation?  \n21:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/trunk/distribution-test/ldap-tests/src/test/it/org/xwiki/test/ldap/framework/XWikiLDAPTestSetup.java  \n21:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(thomas did this, just looking it up now)  \n21:37\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Just run the tests twice with different parameters?  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have 2 test suites  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw we'll need to upgrade to junit4 at some point, just did it on rendering/  \n21:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(by upgrade I mean using junit4 @RunWith rather than use old junit3 TestSuite)  \n21:39\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Can these tests alone be in junit4 without porting all other tests over?  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex I ported only rendering/ test to junit4 ATM  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to do commons next and then some in platform/core  \n21:41\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0cool. I am embarassingly ignorant of maven and junit workings.  \n21:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can help if you have questions  \n21:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at least try ;))  \n21:42\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Thanks, I'm sure I will.  \n21:43\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Also thanks for the suggestion of a new \"class\" of integration tests.  \n21:43\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I was a bit sunk on how to go about that.  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes would be great to have some functional tests for it  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm going to try to find some time to do some manual tests for it tomorrow  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it would be awesome to release it as working for XE 3.0 final  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would be one major feature of XE 3.0  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0running perfs tests on it is a must do at some point too  \n21:46\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I think we will be able to make it for 3.0. Not so sure on whether it is wise to turn it on by default but we can cross that bridge when it comes.  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to test file locking when there are multiple threads for ex  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I wouldn't turn it on by default in 3.0  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'd advertise it  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then if we get good feedback we'll see what we do  \n21:48\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0There is a very nice unit test for locking but I need to make it a little less strict because one kind of behavior cannot br proven what order things will happen.  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: btw is it in the release notes of 3.0M3  \n21:50\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0nope, not if it depended on me :(  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's check  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you implemented the trash storage in 3.0M3 right?  \n21:51\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I did.  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's significant enough to be in the R  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/R/RN/  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see it  \n21:51\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I will add it then.  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you have the jira issue? Do you think you could add some blurb about it...  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise30M3  \n21:52\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0XWIKI-6071  \n21:52\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0argh  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still open?  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should close it if it's done (especially since it's released)  \n21:53\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0just did  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why it wasn't in the RN  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0marius couldn't see it  \n21:54\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0the reason why I have been so horribly absent:  \n21:54\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0user@debo8:~$ dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5353 01901520f60cf0d7ed23521288cf5bf640bb7608.dht  \n21:54\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0;; ANSWER SECTION:  \n21:55\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a001901520f60cf0d7ed23521288cf5bf640bb7608.dht. 30 IN A 208.91.129.187  \n21:55\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0:)  \n21:55\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0just looking up a name like that is 17,000 lines of code.  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's a bit cryptic for me but I'll trust you that it's awesome! :)  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a017K LOC is a lot  \n21:56\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0replaces the entire dns infrastructure when it is done.  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok indeed  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go, bb later  \n21:57\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0And not all of that code is mine, there are some libraries that are copy-paste linked.  \n22:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n23:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
