 \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm not talking about configuring the log  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just see the log  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0where would someone find the log produced by XWiki basically  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again there's no difference with standard xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it goes to the current place where jetty is started from  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: and where that is ?  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it depends where you installed it  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again I'm talking about the Windows installer  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually no  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the .bat  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I don't know is the good answer  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just trying to figure it out...  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0check the .bat  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember if it does some \"cd\"  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt the guys execute the .bar directly, I guess he is using the shortcuts  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/bar/.bat/  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but the shortcut calls it  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can indicate where it's executed in a shorcut  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0INSTALL\\_PATH  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0workingDirectory=\"$INSTALL\\_PATH\"  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it should go in the install directory I guess  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which may not be writeable....  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe ther's something I don't understand but it was working in my tests, strange  \n11:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you looked at log file in your tests ?  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no but at the console  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but you could have a console and nothing written anywhere  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we save to a log file?  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in the jetty/hsqldb zip we do  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to check the jetty conf  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least on linux  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah that's hwy it works  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we configured jetty to log in the data dir  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<Arg><Property name=\"xwiki.data.dir\" default=\".\"/>/logs/yyyy\\_mm\\_dd.output.log</Arg>  \n11:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0<ARGH>  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we really need to integrate a log displayer in logging administration...  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0pretty much implement tail in a wiki page  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least that, but I'd also like to bring it to the level of the wiki pages  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie display errors/warnings that are displayed when viewing a given page  \n12:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does someone remember if we implemented having a link to a filter in a LT in the end?

 \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica, tmortagne, mflorea?  \n16:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0tmortagne: turns out, $services.commandRunner.run(\"ls -la\", \"\", 1000) \u00a0\u00a0does indeed work :)  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: ok  \n16:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: I would really like to play with it as an extension first, before replacing the homepage  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm asking because moving to an extension is some work  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then if I need to move it again it's again some more work  \n16:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: since we haven't agreed on the solution, I also think it would be good to have it as an extension first to see how it works  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: the question for me is really  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we see it as slightly better than what exists or not  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we consider it even slightly better then we should have it IMO  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then remove it later on when we have a better solution  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(like the new home page for which I started a discussion)  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we're not sure it's better than I agree  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that it's better to just have it as an extension  \n16:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: it's hard to tell only from the mails. Having it as an extension that can be installed and played with can help  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not the mail  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are plenty of screenshots too :)  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll do it as an extension  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(didn't want to spend more time on it but ok will do)  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0screenshots here ftr: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10586  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think the screenshots are pretty good to have an idea (I've just checked them now)  \n16:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0my problem is that this solution seems very complex to me. I never read the whole text the first time and I scan it also now. Even if it allows the users to change the homepage with another page \u2026 I would still have preferred to delete the dashboard by pressing delete, than to read all that.  \n16:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0brb  \n16:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I have a meeting  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has 2 features: be able to replace with your own content (step 4 and 5) or use another page (steps 2 and 3)  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway, doing it as an extension. My only fear is that it stays there as an extension and we don't do anything anytime soon to fix the current issues  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which has been going on forever  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and shame on us, w've never done anything about it  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0caty: you had the task to improve it several times  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the roadmap  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with JV)  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in the end nothing was done  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probaby because we were looking for something perfect  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus we preferred to not do anything  \n16:51\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all I know is that GL likes it, Ludovic also foudn it better than what exists so I think it has a good chance of being better than what we have now  \n16:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the task was to easily change the Welcome Text \u2026. now we want to remove all the Homepage, because we couldn't find a way to use a better gadget  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and with the test on my wife is was easier by far compared to what we have)  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if we really do something quickly it's fine to not have it  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0quickly = in 6.3  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's about wait the next cycle then we should have it  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO  \n16:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: I am going to consider it when handling the issue for 6.3M1  \n16:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the work you did + the mails on the topic  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: yup  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I mean  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is htat committing it is about 10 minutes for me (I think)  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm just hesitating between that vs not doing anything  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or moving it as an extension, which is about 1 hour)  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway, right now from what I hear  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I should take that hour to move to extensions  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*move it  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: is that what you think too?  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0caty is for that, and so is marius  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could also commit it on a branch on platform btw\u2026 but then no extension to try it out easily  \n16:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I can`t say much since I wanted to handle it at the point. I might even consider that for what we need to do it would be a good start.  \n16:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or do both  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I, personally, would prefer to build on top of your work  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commit on branch, then move as extension and publish  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but I really need to look better at the detaisl  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(in a meeting now)  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: it really depends if we agree about the simple approach I proposed  \n16:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I did not followed the related mails but if there is no agreement it would be weird to commit it anyway  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie no dashboard on home page  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: there might be no agreement on what we want to have  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but have a an agreement that t's better than what exists  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I would need to re-read the emails  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I din't think anyone was strongly against it  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0caty just said that she doesn't think it solves all issues  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol> and that she found it a bit complex  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I doubt that she thinks that the current solution is better  \n16:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's not very clear to me if evalica find it better or not  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed it's not 100% clear  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0although  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have peronsally 0 doubt about that and she shouldn't based on what she presented from her usability sessions )  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally I don't think it's the end solution  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'm sure it's a lot better than what we have  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0waiting 5 more minutes  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I'll start the work of moving the code to contrin  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0contrib  \n17:27\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:30\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n17:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:41\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:46\u00a0<EA>\u00a0hello! I copied a set of pages to a new subwiki that now has my name all over \u201cCreated by\u201d and \u201cLast modified by\u201d fields. I read some of the lengthy discussion the dev team had about fixing/not-changing that behavior.  \n18:47\u00a0<EA>\u00a0i was wondering if there was ever a solution for rolling back at least the last modified author to the previous author? i.e. so it doesn\u2019t show my name on these copied/moved documents.  \n18:48\u00a0<EA>\u00a0Would that be counterintuitive to find such a solution? For example, if I rollback an author and save that change, wouldn\u2019t I then be modifying that document and staying as the last modifying author?  \n18:59\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<unfed>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:05\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:09\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<EA>\u00a0anyways - I think we\u2019ve decided \u00a0here to just stick with having my name on the documents as last modifier.  \n19:11\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:17\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n20:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:01\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:45\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
