 \ntmortagne - (16:44): save action event is when someone ask for the URL /xwiki/bin/save....  \ntmortagne - (16:44): not when a document is saved  \ntmortagne - (16:45): in short statistics module does not store what happen in XWiki but users actions  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 16:48  \nmflorea - (16:48): hmm, I'm not sure what's best.. /bin/save can lead to 0 or no saves at document level.  \nmflorea - (16:49): 0 or multiple, I mean  \ntmortagne - (16:51): it depends what we want to log in the stats, currently it seems user action has been listen on purpose instead of storage events  \ntmortagne - (16:51): amkes sense to me  \ntmortagne - (16:51): makes  \ntmortagne - (16:52): we want to know that a user asked to remove the user page XWiki.SomeUser and not that it also modifed XWiki.XWikiAllGroup to remove the user from it  \nnickless left at 16:53 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \ntmortagne - (16:53): but it depends of the POV  \nmflorea - (16:53): I see. but some admins might wonder why XWikiAllGroups doesn't appear in the stats  \ntmortagne - (16:53): sure  \nmflorea - (16:54): it should be configurable I think  \nmflorea - (16:54): although no one complained so far  \nmflorea - (16:54): so I guess the current behavior is fine  \ntmortagne - (16:56): no sure it's that heavily used ;)  \nmflorea - (16:56): that's true also  \nmflorea - (16:58): the problem is that statistics can mislead you if you don't know how they were recorded.  \nmflorea - (17:05): for instance, if you go to /bin/view/UnexistingPage the stats module records a view for this page although this page doesn't exist  \nmflorea - (17:06): and you can have it as \"the most viewed page\" :)  \ntmortagne - (17:06): not sure at which point the event is generated  \ntmortagne - (17:06): you tested it ?  \nmflorea - (17:06): yes, the view counter is incremented each time I visit the page  \ntmortagne - (17:07): we could generate action event only if the action did not produced an error maybe  \nmflorea - (17:07): I can modify the stats to check if the page exists  \ntmortagne - (17:07): now maybe you want to know that  \nmflorea - (17:07): isNew = false  \ntmortagne - (17:07): that there is an issue somewhere like a dead link that make a lot of people goes to a wrong page  \ntmortagne - (17:08): after the user did asked to view the page  \nmflorea - (17:09): I see  \ntmortagne - (17:09): if the stats module is supposed to be some kind google analytics that makes sense  \nDenis left at 17:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (17:13): tmortagne: cool just finished the impl for the relative resolver, took 3 lines of code ;)  \ntmortagne - (17:13): :  \ntmortagne - (17:13): :)  \nsamuel1 joined #xwiki at 17:17  \njvelociter left at 17:20 (Quit: jvelociter  \nbblfish - (17:21): hi all, so what's the executive summary of the days work :-)  \nvmassol - (17:22): bblfish: so far, so good  \nbblfish - (17:22): that's the religious summary  \nvmassol - (17:23): (but I haven't tried to install your stuff yet, was too happy to get myxwiki.org back on track\u2026 :))  \nbblfish - (17:23): cool  \nvmassol - (17:23): now I need to muster the courage to try again  \nvmassol - (17:23): bblfish: the pb was that the disk space was full in /tmp  \nvmassol - (17:23): (fyi)  \nbblfish - (17:23): ouch!  \nvmassol - (17:24): becuase when it didn't start the first time I moved your jars to /tmp  \nvmassol - (17:24): and /tmp is quite small on this machine  \nvmassol - (17:25): and /tmp is used by mysql  \nbblfish - (17:25): ouch  \nvmassol - (17:25): :)  \nbblfish - (17:25): and those are quite small jars too I think!  \nvmassol - (17:25): yes but there were other stuff already in there  \nbblfish - (17:26): I think there's a monty python sketch on something like that  \nvmassol - (17:26): the previous version of the bcprov jar that I had already moved the first time and others  \nvmassol - (17:26): :)  \nbblfish - (17:26): You know the one with King Arthur and the holy grail  \nvmassol - (17:26): yes I recall it but I don't recall something similar  \nbblfish - (17:26): and the killer rabbit  \nvmassol - (17:27): I remember the \"let's call it a draw!\"  \nvmassol - (17:27): or \"bring up your deads\"  \nvmassol - (17:27): yes the killer rabbit I remember  \nbblfish - (17:27): I think the guy from the countryside goes into a workshop, and harmlessly points out that something could be better by doing something different, and everything collapses  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 17:27  \nbblfish - (17:27): :)  \nvmassol - (17:27): indeed  \nbblfish - (17:31): well let me know when you feel comfortable doing WebId piece. :-) I am just writing up a piece on logic here...  \nvmassol - (17:36): ahah cool he's going to update the page ;)  \nbblfish - (17:37): ?
