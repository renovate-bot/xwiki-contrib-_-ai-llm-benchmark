 \n17:48\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0does xwiki have this functionality?  \n18:17\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0Ok, there is a macro called \"Table of contents\"  \n18:17\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0But I would like to have its result in a side-menu... possible? :)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cdop: sure  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cdop: trying it locally  \n18:27\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0i googled for \"xwiki table of contents sidebar\" but didnt find anything  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have panels  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now it seems it's not so obvious to get teh toc macro to work in a panel for the main doc content, I'm trying to find a solution  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cdop: or are you talking about this:  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/PageEditing  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the TOC on the right)  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if so all you need is a box macro around the toc macro: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/PageEditing?viewer=code  \n18:31\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0yes, but i would like to have it in the sidebar... or automatically generated. on my wiki real dumb word-users will add and edit pages...  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see, goodp oint  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0interesting question :)  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course one solution is to modify the correct vm  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0contentview.vm  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's not easy  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since you cannot call a macro from a vm\u2026.  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess the simplest is to add a Skin Extension  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not very easy either  \n18:36\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0maybe i can use templates? which always include the TOC-Macro?  \n18:36\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0(I wont allow Source.Editing)  \n18:36\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0(Only wysiwyg)  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to think a bit more  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0template would work but it's cumbersome for this use case  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since as you say when you edit  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the user will be able to remove it  \n18:37\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0even in the wysiwyg?  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n18:38\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0ok, then an extension is the way to go...  \n18:38\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0cant be to hard to add a new menu-bar?  \n18:40\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0well well....  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cdop: I think you should create a jira issue for this  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could easily improve the TOC macro to support this use case  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then use it in a panel  \n18:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying something  \n18:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: i think cdop could write a new toc macro and inside this macro get the transformation content and change the current block and xdom in there ;)  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/content/context  \n18:54\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0erm, right  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a new wiki macro I mean  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's probably 3-4 lines of scripts  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you can use this new macro in a panel  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me try it locally  \n18:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: hmm, changing the context doc requires PR and by default panels don't have PR  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not about changing the context doc  \n18:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0PR are dropped just before rendering the panels  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the xdom in the Transformation context  \n18:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ah  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that will require groovy for sure  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that requires PR  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ok  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's in the macro  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not in the panel  \n18:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but the macro will require PR  \n18:58\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0something like:  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{groovy}}  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0def txcontext = xcontext.macro.context  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0def xdom = xwiki.getDocument(\"Sandbox.WebHome\").getDocument().getXDOM()  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0txcontext.setXDOM(xdom)  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0println \"{{toc/}}\"  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{/groovy}}  \n19:02\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0ok, thats way too deep for me ;)  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cdop: sure, I'm planning to give you the full solution if it works  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not going to work  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I have another idea ;)  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got it!  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: here: https://gist.github.com/3853664  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now just need to replace the hardcode doc with the docname, give me 1 mn  \n19:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0does it work in a panel?
