I found how to do it last week  \n09:32\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0vmassol: we also need to update the script we use to copy commons/rendering/platform/xe jobs since it's not renaming properly the links (the new jobs keep links on master jobs)  \n09:32\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0has quit  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok weird, what links are you referring to?  \n09:33\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0we changes most of the jobs to have explicit links instead of use automated snapshots links some time ago  \n09:34\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the script should just rename all the link it can find but right now it just recreate the links it think it think are supposed to be there  \n09:34\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the script should just rename all the link it can find but right now it just recreate the links it think are supposed to be there  \n09:34\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the script should just rename all the link it can find but right now it just recreate the links it think are supposed to be there and don't touch others  \n09:35\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0talking about links between jobs (\"when this jobs is built start this one\", etc)  \n09:36\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the IRC bot should probably be modifed to generate https links to jira instead of the current http ones  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other option is to speed up the move to pipeline and have it handle branches automatically  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we're close to being able to do that  \n09:39\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0there is still the explicit link issue  \n09:39\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0how to you make jobs depends on each other with pipeline ?  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good question, I'll research that but I'm sure there's an api  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw just found https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Dependency+Walker+Plugin. I still need to understand if it would have any interest for us  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case it could be nice to implement the automated release process I'm dreaming of ;)  \n09:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: do you have an example of a JenkinsFile that enables the -Pintegration-tests profile?  \n09:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0actually forget that, I don't use a JenkinsFile :)  \n09:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for the moment  \n09:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0btw, do we know what causes http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-contrib-application-ckeditor/146/  \n09:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Groovy script failed: org.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.scripts.UnapprovedClasspathException: classpath entry file:/var/lib/jenkins/scriptler/scripts/ (fb9e1bc3c70175e29bf831e129551ed53362a93f) not yet approved for use  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding integration-tests profile, it's by default ;)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when you use xwikiModule DSL)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: yes I know what causes it  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0groovy runs in sandbox  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw mflorea why is this extension not using pipeline?  \n10:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I need the 6.2.5 parent first. I just didn't spent the time to release parent 6.2.5 and more to pipeline  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0mflorea: your job is using a very old postbuild  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0fixing it  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I don't understand. the parent version you use is defined in the pom.xml, not in the jenkinsfile. The jenkinsfile is not working with 6.2.5?  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0should be ok now  \n10:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I didn't set any post build, it probably comes from the copy  \n10:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0when I created the job initially I copied from some other job  \n10:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0a very long time ago then :)  \n10:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, 1 year ago  \n10:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0when I started working on CKEditor integration  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I would still be interested to understand why our jenkinsfile cannot be used to build ckeditor extension as is :)  \n10:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: here http://contrib.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome#HRequestingCI2FSnapshotbuildsforyourproject the JenkinsFile seems to be related to the parent-XXX module.  \n10:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I haven't tried, but my impression when reading that was that I have to use the parent-platform parent first  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0mflorea: it's not  \n10:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0my current parent is xwiki-commons-pom  \n10:14\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, thanks, then I'll give it a try (as I said, I haven't tried, just read that and got the impression that I need to move to parent-platform first)  \n10:15\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0mflorea: by the way publishing a new contrib parent takes 5 minutes  \n10:28\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'll do it when I get back to CK, I need to work on the Administration for the next couple of days  \n10:29\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0would it make that much of a difference to use the already exising 6.4 based parent by the way ?  \n10:29\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it's quite old too  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it's quite old too so it's probably not such a bid deal to do this upgrade  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: using jenkinsfile is a matter of 2mn normally, you just need to commit the same jenkinsfile than other jobs  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and remove/disable your job and you're done  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/job/existing job  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cannot be simpler :)  \n10:43\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0hi guys, regarding my performance issue on the doc tree (and also the one about the nested pages) explained yesterday, any idea ?  \n10:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi faichelbaum  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea on my side except that it looks like some old issue we fixed. mflorea should know more (when he's available)  \n10:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0faichelbaum: the doc tree performance has been fixed with http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13468 and http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13700.
