THIS IS IMPORTANT: the text for This databasename MUST have it's first letter CAPITALIZED. \u00a0This is regardless of your database setup!!!!!!! \" -- does this mean the page name must be capitalized, or the db created for the vhost must be capitalized??   \nnpm - (12/01/2009 19:09): http://n2.nabble.com/Need-some-explanation-about-virtual-xwiki-td1394238.html uses lowercase, so i'm assuming only the doc'd assoc'd with the vhost database needs the \u00a0capitalization constraint.  \nnpm - (12/01/2009 19:13): NB: unless in virtual mode, don't set xwiki.db.prefix, or you get some very unhelpful error messages: ### 2009-01-10 17:31:25,132 [http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/] [http-127.0.0.1-8080-Processor3] WARN \u00a0util.JDBCExceptionReporter \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- SQL Error: 1142, SQLState: 42000   \nnpm - (12/01/2009 19:13): ### 2009-01-10 17:31:25,132 [http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/] [http-127.0.0.1-8080-Processor3] ERROR util.JDBCExceptionReporter \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- SELECT command denied to user 'xwiki'@'localhost' for table 'xwikidoc'   \nnpm - (12/01/2009 19:13): ### com.xpn.xwiki.XWikiException: Error number 3202 in 3: Exception while reading document XWiki.XWikiPreferences  \nnpm - (12/01/2009 19:13): ### Wrapped Exception: could not load an entity: [com.xpn.xwiki.doc.XWikiDocument#104408758]  \nnpm - (12/01/2009 19:13): ### Wrapped Exception: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: SELECT command denied to user 'xwiki'@'localhost' for table 'xwikidoc'  \nxwikibot - (12/01/2009 22:54): XWiki.damodarp was modified by XWiki.damodarp (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/damodarp  \n\n"}
