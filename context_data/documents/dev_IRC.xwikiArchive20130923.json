I think we'll need one more day for this, so we either postpone the release for tomorrow or do this for 5.2 final. I prefer to postpone.  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: postpone by the RC by one day seems better indeed. If we can keep the 5.2 final date FTM it's better.

E.g., jobManager.executeJob(\"A\", req1); jobManager.executeJob(\"A\", req2); jobManager.executeJob(\"B\", req3); will execute A,req1 and B,req3 in parallel and put A,req2 in wait until A,req1 is done?  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: there is no parallel execution yet  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0everything that go trough JobManager is executed on the same background thread one by one right now  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-400)  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now for the serialization itself I'm not sure I understand what you ask exactly  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a job status is serializer when it's done runnning  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/serializer/serialized/  \n15:17\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0serialized in the sense that no two jobs of the \\*same\\* type can be executed concurrently. So if you ask to execute 3 requests of a job type A, these requests will be serialized in the sense that the second will start when the first is done, and the third will start when the second is done. A request for a job of another type can, in case, be executed in parallel  \n15:19\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0anyway http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-400 is even more strict, in the sense that there is only one job executing at a given time :)  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: I can assure you it's impossible to execute jobs in parallel for now in job module, same type or not  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes even when you use executeJob  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0executeJob actually call addJob and wait for it to be done  \n15:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: note that before XCOMMONS-400 I would like to evaluate XCOMMONS-443, it may completely remove this module or a big part of it  \n15:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so if you feel like experimenting stuff you can look at it ;)  \n15:23\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0hm. it seems to me that the code rendering macro is quite a bit faster now than it used to be.  \n15:23\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0(i.e. 5.1 vs 3.4 or so)  \n15:24\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: we upgraded Jythong since 3.4 so might be it  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Jython  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and they were indeed supposed to work on speed but I did not really done much testing  \n15:25\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0rightbut  \n15:26\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0any change for caching it automatically?  \n15:26\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0or does that still require wrapping it in a cache macro?  \n15:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-8456 is still open  \n15:26\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha something else, highligting used to be done 1 thread at a time  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not true anymore  \n15:27\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0yeah I just tested that  \n15:27\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0that helps quite a lot  \n15:27\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0sorry I crashed  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when there is a lot of users yes  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Inge-: if you fill like working on XWIKI-8456 I can give you some pointers  \n15:28\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0well, if the rendering took 50 seconds, and everything else was waiting for it ... you didn't need very many users  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a050s is really a lot  \n15:29\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0a 200 line bit of code took a long time in 3.4  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it took like 10s the first time it's used to initialize Jython but then I never saw it take 50s  \n15:29\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0now it was down to around 10s  \n15:30\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0and after wrapping in macro, it is <1sec  \n15:30\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0i.e. caching macro  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0probably Jython for this one then  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what syntax was it ?  \n15:30\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0C#  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gtg, bb in 1 hour  \n16:29\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0enterprise build is broken  \n16:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I am still getting DW wizard after creating a workspace (today's snapshot)  \n16:59\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sburjan: did you changed the extension repository in xwiki.properties ?  \n16:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: nope. do I need to activate the snapshot repository ?  \n17:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Yes, before creating the wiki template  \n17:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0(you can delete \"workspacetemplate\" with the Wiki Manager UI)  \n17:05\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:07\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:08\u00a0<chalx1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Quick question, should we allow spaces in usernames?

 \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw this is explained on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DevelopmentPractices  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my second point was about the fix itself  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think the issue is that $doc.getValue() returns null  \n18:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's because there is no value  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's because of null  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I was wondering if we shoudl do: $!doc.getValue() instead  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which makes more sense to me  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0than $!escapetool.xml()  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'm not 100% sure  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway could you redo your PR and I'll apply it  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with XWIKI-8592)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it exists but it's a security issue  \n18:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: If I do $escapetool.xml($!doc.getValue()) it still don't work  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so not public  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you try:  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$!{doc.getValue()}  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise the ! might apply to doc only  \n18:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0not better  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I don't understand the issue  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless there's a bug in escapetool  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$escapetool.xml(\"\") should return \"\"  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'm not understanding something clearly  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\u00a0$escapetool.xml('') returns ''  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes just tested  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\u00a0$escapetool.xml($util.null) returns null  \n18:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0$!{doc.getValue($sectionProperty)} returns ''  \n18:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but $escapetool.xml($!{doc.getValue($sectionProperty)}) returns null  \n18:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't understand why  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so we're 2  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway if your solution works go for it  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would still be interesting to understand why it doesn't wokr....  \n18:28\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I delete my JIRA ?
