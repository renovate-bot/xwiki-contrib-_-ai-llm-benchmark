I have a group \"Company foo\" and a Group \"Division bar\". Wiki Page should be accessible for users, which are both in foo and in bar  \n08:06\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0Or do I have to create groups for each combination of company and division?  \n08:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think that's possible  \n08:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now I don't really understand this use case, isn't the Division your are toalking about a part of Company foo ?  \n08:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/toalking/talking/  \n08:09\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0It is  \n08:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can put groups inside groups  \n08:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so given your setup I would put Division bar inside Company foo  \n08:09\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0I know.. this does not help..  \n08:10\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0sometimes access should be controlled across divisions of different companies..  \n08:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I mean is that if you are part of Division foo you are part of the company anyway, no ?  \n08:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you have a use case with a user part of two different division in different companies ?  \n08:13\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0actually, no  \n08:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then I don't understand your need  \n08:14\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0ok, I try to formulate the use-case.. one moment..  \n08:17\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0I have for example 8 companies and each of them has 8 divisions. So in total we have 64 divisions. Each user is part of only one division and one company. How do I map it with xwiki groups? Do I have to create 8 company groups and 64 division groups? and this division groups I assign as subgroup to the company group?  \n08:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes you should create 8 company groups and 64 division groups  \n08:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and put divisions groups in company groups  \n08:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0after that's what you have, will make much easier to set rights  \n08:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/after/after all/  \n08:25\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0Nevertheless it would be nice to have a feature, that wiki pages check that Users are within several particular groups... like if (user in Purchase\\_Division and user in Europe\\_Competence\\_Area) then GRANT ACCESS  \n08:26\u00a0<Kalleos>\u00a0by that some more advanced matrix organizations could be mapped...  \n08:28\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm not so sure it such a common use case and people already complain about the complexity of the rights in XWiki :)  \n08:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but sure you should create an issue on http://jira.xwiki.org  \n08:40\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: regarding the screenshots, I don't understand what you want me to do. Isn't the release app responsible for displaying the images nicely?

The reason it doesn't do that is because I don't know how to do resize only if the image is above a certain size (I haven't researched it either TBH). So right now we need to upload images to the right size as otehrwise they appear too large in \"flow \" view  \n10:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't know what the \"right size\" means? As for \"resize only if the image is above a certain size\", you can probably use https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/max-width  \n10:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0there's also max-height  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right size is defined in our best pratices  \n10:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0do you have a link?  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DocGuide#HScreenshots2FImages  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for RN pages full size might be too large for example  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I get some time I'll upate the RN app to use what you said  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(max-width)  \n10:16\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: the issue with max-width is that you would be overwriting the max-width:100% from the skin, and this will break the display on small screens (we will get a horizontal scroll bar). The best is probably to use max-width in combination with a media query. i.e. apply max-width:N only when screen size is larger than N  \n10:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0i.e. \"for screen widths larger than N limit the image width to N\"  \n10:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(and thus keep max-width:100% for screens with width less than N)  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll need to check this out  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thx  \n10:22\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: checking  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: created https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/RN-28 FTM  \n10:35\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has quit  \n10:37\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n10:52\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: missed the extra fields because they are not exposed in the sheet  \n11:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0updating the object  \n11:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0org.hibernate.hql.ast.QuerySyntaxException: ActivityEventImpl is not mapped [select event from ActivityEventImpl event where event.page LIKE concat(event.wiki, ':%')]  \n11:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0It's the stracktrace I have on /home/gdelhumeau/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-user/xwiki-platform-user-directory/xwiki-platform-user-directory-test/xwiki-platform-user-directory-test-tests/  \n11:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the mapping is located inside the activitystream-api jar, which is bundled  \n11:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I cannot reproduce on XE  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did your check hibernate.cfg.xml ?
