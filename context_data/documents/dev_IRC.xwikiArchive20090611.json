Now in term of implementation you should start simple and only convert the most important first and then add more and more coversion featrures till we get a perfect or acceptable conversion  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:04): arunreddy: what's your next step?  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:04): yeah.   \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:05): arunreddy: have you posted your action plan somewhere?  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:05): with dates and milestones?  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:05): I don't remember eeing it  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:05): s/eeing/seeing/  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:05): this is really important to do  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:05): little confused. whether to head on with XML dumps .. or Direct Database .  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:06): you're going to miss the deadlines and not succeed if you don't do a planning and respect it  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:06): yeah i did one. but not happy with the planning.   \nlucaa1 joined #xwiki at 09:06  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:06): re XML vs DB I couldn't understand well enough what you wrote to decide (for ex you say with XML it's missing link metadata but I have no clue what this means)  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:07): best of course is to have a design that allows both  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:07): and have the max of code in common for both strategies  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:07): OK.  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:07): so basically XML or DB code would implement a Data source interface  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:08): and all the code thereafter will simply use the Data source interface to do its job  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:08): the XML/DB access layer will simply populate that data source object with whatever info they can gather  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:08): something like this  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:09): so you abstract the data and how you get it  \nvnkatesh - (11/06/2009 09:10): vmassol: I've integrated your standalone renderer for xeclipse.  \nvnkatesh - (11/06/2009 09:10): vmassol: scripting is not supported right?  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:10): vnkatesh: cool  \nvnkatesh - (11/06/2009 09:10): vmassol by the renderer?  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:10): vnkatesh: it is   \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:10): but you need to understand something  \nvnkatesh - (11/06/2009 09:11): vmassol: yes?  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:11): Get the content from data source .. Parse it \u00a0and create the dump in the temp directory. and use the same to render XWIKI the pages.  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:11): vnkatesh: I haven't separated some macros yet, meaning they need access to a DocumentAccessBridge to work.They are: script macro, include macro and useravatar macro  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:12): vnkatesh: can you explain to me what you're working on?  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:13): vnkatesh: since I don't understand why you need the rendering  \nvnkatesh - (11/06/2009 09:13): vmassol: standalone renderer for xeclipse. (Instead of the inbuilt-browser that shows the page-preview)  \nvnkatesh - (11/06/2009 09:13): vmassol I'd be rendering the content locally..  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:13): vnkatesh: hmmm I don't think this is the way to do it  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:13): vmassol : Can i stick to this three step process : \u00a0Datasource > temp dump > XWiki Pages.  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:14): vnkatesh: we've discussed this several times in the past and the idea is to include a standalone XE in XEclipse instead  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:14): vnkatesh: you should discuss this on the dev list before doing more work IMO  \nvnkatesh - (11/06/2009 09:14): ok, I will.  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:14): arunreddy: sure, if you really need the dump  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:17): Yes. the files are really huge at times. and at times they have back links. Holding them in memory will be a bit difficult. If we have a \u00a0temp dump in a standard way . we can use them same for others too.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 09:19  \ntrifon joined #xwiki at 09:19  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:20): arunreddy: the size of the files doesn't matter  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:20): since you'll need to set the content of the XWiki Document anyway  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:20): and that takes a String API  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:20): so you'll need it in memory anyway  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:20): what matters is not to hold several pages in memory  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:20): (ie work page by page)  \nvmassol - (11/06/2009 09:21): and if this cannot be done then I agree a temp dir will help  \nlucien joined #xwiki at 09:22  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:22): the process includes .. fetching the data from db.. parsing it.. rendering it to xwiki syntax and creating a xwiki document.  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:23): and there are few things like ( XWiki Internal Links ) which are taken care of at run time.  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:23): and that will be \u00a0a problem.  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:23): So the one in my mind is .. create the dump in \u00a0a xwiki friendly way..   \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:23): Using that we can customise the whole import process.  \narunreddy - (11/06/2009 09:26): Handling macros will be easier.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 09:39  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 09:47  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 10:08  \nglerouge joined #xwiki at 10:11  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 10:12  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 10:19  \nmflorea left at 10:23 (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))  \nlucien left at 10:32 (\"Leaving.\")  \nkaaloo joined #xwiki at 10:34  \nvnkatesh left at 10:37 (Remote closed the connection)  \nkaaloo left at 10:39 (\"Leaving.\")  \nvmassol left at 10:41 ()  \ncypromis joined #xwiki at 10:42  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 10:43  \nvnkatesh joined #xwiki at 11:11  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 11:30  \nanamarias left at 11:41 ()  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 11:49  \ncristinaS joined #xwiki at 12:04  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 12:29  \nvnkatesh left #xwiki at 12:32  \ntachirei joined #xwiki at 12:38  \ntachirei left #xwiki at 12:42  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 13:22  \njvdrean left at 14:02 ()  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 14:06  \narunreddy left at 14:27 (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))  \ncristinaS left at 14:30 (\"Think your current client is sexy?

  \ntmortagne - (11/06/2009 20:00): bind\\_DN and bind\\_pass are the \"main\" login/pass to connect to LDAP server  \njpdota - (11/06/2009 20:01): Oh, those aren't the authenticating username/pass then...  \ntmortagne - (11/06/2009 20:01): you can put some admin user or even a pattern for LDAP auth to use the user which is connecting to xwiki  \ntmortagne - (11/06/2009 20:01): it depends if users have right to list groups and things like that  \njpdota - (11/06/2009 20:01): Isn't that relatively insecure?  \ntmortagne - (11/06/2009 20:02): why ?  \njpdota - (11/06/2009 20:02): putting in an actual password into the config?  \ntmortagne - (11/06/2009 20:03): putting a clear password somewhere is already an issue but here your are supposed to put password only if all the other way don't work  \nsdumitriu - (11/06/2009 20:03): Normally nobody should have access to it  \ntmortagne - (11/06/2009 20:03): already=always  \njpdota - (11/06/2009 20:03): what other way? \u00a0the pattern you were talking about?  \ntmortagne - (11/06/2009 20:04): jpdota: if your users has right to list groups on ldap server you don't need to put admin login/pass  \ntmortagne - (11/06/2009 20:04): which ldap server are you using ?
