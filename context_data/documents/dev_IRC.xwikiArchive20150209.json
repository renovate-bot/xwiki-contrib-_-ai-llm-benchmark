We still need the translations.  \n10:41\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0vmassol: I already did, http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9386  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could someone check the LDAP tests http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ldap-6.4.x/ ? (on my side I need to work on some large mail api refactoring asap)  \n10:42\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0sorry, not this one  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:42\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11770  \n10:42\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0this one  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the test is new?  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(because it wasn't failing before AFAIK)  \n10:44\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0no, the test is old, but I added unicode chars to cover http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11747 and so we discover XWIKI-11770  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes ok it's new (that's what I meant)  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the question is when do we plan to fix those 2 issues  \n10:44\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0there are two options: either fix XWQL to support unicode or use HQL in AWM instead of XWQL  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not now then we may want to disable this part of the test for now  \n10:45\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0the first issue is fixed, but with the fix we discovered the other issue  \n10:46\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0the quickest is to replace XWQL with HQL  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea1: if HQL supports unicode is it hard to have XWQL support it?  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since it translates into HQL)  \n10:47\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I've no idea, I guess we need to change a bit the grammar of the XWQL to accept unicode chars in the doc.object(XXX) syntax  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be quicker to have XWQL support unicode than move to AWM actually  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:48\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0afaics, there is only one query to tranform to HQL, but fixing this one might show others.  \n10:49\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0(i.e. there is only one query that fails, but other may fail if we fit it and the test passes after that point)  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it could be good to quickly perform an analysis on the XWQL translation code to see where the unicode issue could come from  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then we can decide what to do depending on ho much work there is. Say, spend 1 hour on it and if nothing is found, use HQL for ex? WDYT?  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0sure  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I will take a look  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0short \u00a0look  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool, thanks, yes short ;)  \n10:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: are you working on http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/852/?  \n10:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0akins because the recent push on commons handles a checkstyle problem, but the previous platform build has failed tests that do not seem related  \n10:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*asking  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: there was several commits after build 852  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0my last commit fixed several failing tests for sure, waiting now  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*commits  \n11:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, that`s what I was asking  \n11:26\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: xwiki-platform\\_Quality\\_Checks is ok so I guess it's ok this time  \n11:50\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:58\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:27\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n12:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea1: cool :) (just saw your last comment in the jira issue)  \n12:33\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I'm going to quote the class name in AWM  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep ok  \n13:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: there is http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11750 and mflorea1: there is http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11757  \n13:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0bott are marked as regressions and blockers  \n13:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*both  \n13:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0XWIKI-11750 is there since 6.2actually  \n13:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0is there any plan to do something about them, today, or should I push them to 7.0M2 as well?  \n13:11\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it won't be fixed today for sure  \n13:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I see  \n13:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0pushed both issues to 7.0M2  \n13:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Reminder: missing documentation on XWIKI-11719 ( vmassol ) and XWIKI-11252 ( tmortagne )  \n13:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: I probably won't have time to take care of this today (big thing) but should not block the release  \n13:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, will just comment on the issue in order to not forget  \n13:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: thanks, adding doc for http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11719  \n13:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0cool, thx  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: done  \n13:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thx  \n13:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:17\u00a0<[d\\_\\_d]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: looks like I forgot to remove the ssh key from by github account  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm surprised you did not get any error when you tried to add it  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should be ok now  \n15:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: weird  \n15:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0here it says that you pushed 1 commit, but that I have authored it  \n15:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0on github it does not mention you  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are the author because it's your id in the commit, the ssh is used only for the push  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure why github does not mention it  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway now it should be ok  \n15:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok  \n15:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: lol, after you have removed the ssh key from your account it does not allow me to use it.
