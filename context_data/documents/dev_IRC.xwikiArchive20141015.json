I think your commit causes this: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform-5.4.x/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-oldcore/29/testReport/  \n10:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0in 6.2.x too  \n10:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, I'm aware of it  \n10:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Hi guys  \n11:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0is disabling comment/attachment/etc\u2026 is expected to completely make the feature unusable ?  \n11:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think you can always use \u00a0e.g. the object editor to add comments  \n11:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Actually, I though the goal was to remove them from the extradoc tabs, but not from the choice of viewer  \n11:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0ok, and I can type ?viewer=attachment in the url, I know  \n11:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0what I wonder is what were our target  \n11:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0is it the behavior expected  \n11:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0?  \n11:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Another related question is the Show Document Annotation which works differently, while in the exact same posture  \n11:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and my third question, is what is the purpose of showing annotation twice in both comments and annotations ?  \n11:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the UI of the annotation feature is really crap  \n11:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0Denis: please detail. I should have an opinion about that, but I need a more detailed version of \"really crap\"  \n11:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0:)  \n11:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0also, I need to finish something by midday 30 so I will be back with you in 1 hour  \n11:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am talking about the way it is now done in Flamingo  \n11:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0nothing as been adapted, this is not efficient having that separate check box  \n11:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I have already expressed some comment about it in the discussion about the Add menu  \n11:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and now, that doubling tab in extra tabs, the discrepency of behavior between show annotation and others shows  \n11:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0Denis: I would need to have a closer look at the doubling of tab. Normally that tab is deactivated  \n11:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0and is to be used if you customize the annotations config and set a different class for annotations than the one for comments (this is possible)  \n11:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0it is by default  \n11:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but you can change that easily  \n11:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0while changing the annotation class, I do not even know how to do it  \n11:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0there is a UI, for all shows, and the annotation one seems very unrelated to the others  \n11:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am more and more disappointed by the inconsistencies of the UI  \n11:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0feel free to rewrite the annotation application if you have the time  \n11:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0gd: I am sorry if my remark could look hard, it is not a matter of the annotation application, it is a more general aspect about consistencies, and behavior of the whole UI  \n11:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I have the feeling that we are taking the direction of many OS project, which get very customization but unusable UI, due to inconsistencies and independency of each features  \n11:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0s/customization/customieable  \n11:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0\\*customizable  \n11:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Then please open a JIRA with your suggestions  \n11:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Denis: is XWIKI-11222 really a blocker?  \n11:44\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Make the farm usage impossible  \n11:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you are exposing sisters wikis in each wikis, which disallow using the farm (opposed to workspace) usage of subwikis  \n11:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0indeed  \n11:46\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0take myxwiki.org as a sample, do you expect the wiki facet in your wiki to display potential match in other wiki of the myxwiki farm ?  \n11:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0is this true if the user in the subwiki has no access to the other wikis (in which case they should not see any results from the other wikis anyway?)  \n11:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0probably not  \n11:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(should go and try that by myself ...)  \n11:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but this does not change anything for public farms  \n11:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this could be seen as a feature if we take care of having it based on the type of wikis and have a option to allow or disallow it  \n11:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for a company using wikis for their department, they may want it, or may not, even if user can read other departments wikis  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: if I remove 'wiki', from 'facetFields' in Main.SolrSearchConfig, it removes the 'wiki' facets  \n11:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but is that enough?  \n11:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0do we have something to prevent searching in other wiki that the user cannot bypass?  \n11:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0gdelhumeau: this is not the right approach. That list doesn't mean those facets are always displayed. A facet is displayed only if the search results have multiple values for the corresponding field. In this case all results are from the same wiki so the wiki facet should not appear. Let me handle the issue.  \n11:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok :)  \n12:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Hi Enygma`, as you are looking into XWIKI-8320, should I reassign the issue to you?  \n12:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: how do we proceed for the release. You release 6.2.2 first, and then I release 5.4.6, and finally Thomas releases 6.3m1?  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahah  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm fine with starting  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after lunch  \n12:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a06.2.2 sounds like the most waited one expecially since we want it for xwiki.org upgrade  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in about 1 hour  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and for myxwiki.org too  \n12:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n12:27\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: do you wait for XWIKI-11222?  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0argh a new one  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we have anyone to work on it urgently right now?  \n12:28\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea is working on it  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok great  \n12:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see in 1 hour what happens  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanls mflorea!  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*thanks  \n12:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: do you want to release 6.3m1 before I do 5.4.6?  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd prefer 5.4.6 before  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the opposite  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a06.3M1  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0before  \n12:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: no its ok, will upgrade myxwiki.org with 6.2.2 while you are releasing  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we're already late  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as you want  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it shouldn't take long anyway  \n12:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is the master branch stabilized?  \n12:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Anyway, I think I have a room to push a minor commit right now for 6.2.x and master  \n12:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it is  \n12:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0out for lunch, back in 1h  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same  \n12:39\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0same  \n12:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I was wrong actually. We still have to display a search facet even if it has only one value, so that the user knows that all results have that value for that field. In the case of the wiki facet, the reason we see all values is because we support \"multi-select faceting\"  \n12:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SimpleFacetParameters#Multi-Select\\_Faceting\\_and\\_LocalParams  \n12:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ClemensR: if you don`t plan on doing it for 6.3, then I will probably take over.  \n12:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I could exclude \u00a0the wiki facet from the \"multi-select faceting\" when in a subwiki, but it's better to simply remove the wiki facet from the list as you suggested  \n12:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Enygma`: I will not find time to look into it ... thanks for taking over and sorry for having this lying around so long  \n12:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0no harm done :)  \n13:08\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:10\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n13:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n13:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice mflorea :)  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just in time  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you think I can start the release or should I wait for the full build?  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends how sure you are of yourself ;)  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-6.2.x/ is failing niw  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*now  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-6.2.x/124/testReport/  \n13:52\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: the failing EditObjectsTest.testPropertyDisplayersForNewObjects test started failing after your push: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-6.2.x/119/ any relationship?  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and LoginTest.testRedirectBackAfterLogin started failing after http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-6.2.x/124/ (mflorea)  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see what the new build in progress says\u2026  \n13:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I've seen it failing before, http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-6.2.x/105/  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so flicker  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which we need to fix....  \n13:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0same for EditObjectsTest.testPropertyDisplayersForNewObjects, http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/140/  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but at least I can discard it for 6.2.2  \n13:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I really don't see how my revert could be related  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting the release (translations), please don't commit on 6.2.x  \n14:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0translations \u00a0on a point release?  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, carefully  \n14:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok  \n14:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0make sense if we have introduced some new ones during the stabilization  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I see some removed translations then big warning  \n14:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I mean new translation keys  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same if the format changed  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if new translations then no problem  \n14:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n14:16\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting the maven build for 6.2.x\u2026.  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a06.2.2  \n14:31\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:53\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:54\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:07\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:12\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:28\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm strange  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems the snapshot repo wasn't enabled by default \u00a0in my build on master  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to check why\u2026  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(snapshot extension repo that is)  \n15:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maven part of the release done for 6.2.2  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: agent-1-1 is all yours now  \n15:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0good  \n16:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:03\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:04\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0Hello all!
