Though the problem is how to make the \"model\" interoperable between different platform... If you've seen the little test I've sent you, even a little change could screw things up  \n11:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, works that too. :)  \n11:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but much easier in UI  \n11:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I've installed mysql several times but never had the chance to play with it  \n11:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(even if ok using the UI is bad because then you don't know the mysql command :))  \n11:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0true. you have to suffer using the console. But I like more the console  \n11:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well depends what i need to do  \n11:03\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0fmancinelli: I'm looking at the test code now. I see api lockin but I don't see lockin to a particular store. I suppose you also read about the politics between the JDO and JPA people.  \n11:04\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Also not sure if you have heard of this: http://source.mysema.com/forum/mvnforum/viewthread\\_thread,49  \n11:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If I were calling all of the shots, I would want that to be the new standard way of doing queries.  \n11:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0(probably off topic)  \n11:05\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0cjdelisle: what I meant is that depending on how you put JDO annotations in your classes, the code might work with a store but not with another. So it's not completely transparent  \n11:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I will have to look over that again. One thing I really like is the consept of bytecode tinkering so that we don't need to pollute everything with getters and setters.  \n11:06\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0yep  \n11:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: one last question. In the tutorial we state than XEM and XWiki needs InnoDB and \\_not\\_ MyISAM. Where is the \"switch\" to do this, because I can't see it in the tutorial. Or the setting is made from the hibernate conf file we have on the tutorial page ?  \n11:07\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0cjdelisle: anyway what I sent you is the final result of several attempts to put the right annotations in the right places so that RDBMS and Cassandra stores could be swapped without any problem  \n11:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: i don't know why this documentation say that, i never setup that  \n11:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0IMO you can remove that part  \n11:08\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Ahh, I see. So it really is very fragile.  \n11:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: ask alex maybe if \u00a0it's really important  \n11:09\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Perhaps we can implement some kind of validator. This would be difficult and time consuming to get right unless we used a \"try everything\" validator.  \n11:09\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n11:10\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Re Cassandra, read about that and I agree that it is definitly the future.  \n11:10\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0cjdelisle: not sure... but it's a very interesting topic to do research about :)  \n11:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I suppose if there was something else out there I have not heard about then perhaps it might lose to it but against rdbms and jcr my money is on cassandra.  \n11:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I found this interesting: http://blog.reddit.com/2011/03/why-reddit-was-down-for-6-of-last-24.html  \n11:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0A real life case of a system using postgres and cassandra in the amazon cloud.  \n11:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0And how it failed when lots of disks failed at once.  \n11:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*They used to be 100% postgres but are apparently migrating to cassandra.  \n11:22\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:29\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:32\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0cjdelisle: sure cassandra is more fault tolerant (it's replicated and eventually consistent)... though it's data model is very different (you can have a look at this good article: http://arin.me/blog/wtf-is-a-supercolumn-cassandra-data-model). Though the fact that is eventually consistent might be an issue for some use cases... I mean, having a status on a facebook wall appear after one hour for everyone it's fine. Having a design docu  \n11:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I am referring to this : http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationMySQL \u00a0Read at the beginning  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: ok but really i never change the Mysql database engine and never had any issue, i don't know \u00a0why there is this in this documentation  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0unless it's for old mysql or something like that  \n11:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0look slike it's only for transaction  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's probably safer to use engine which support transaction but we are kind of used to MyISAM now...  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all i'm saying is that it's really not a critical requirement  \n11:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0fmancinelli: you were cut off here: \"one hour for everyone it's fine. Having a design docu|<--  \n11:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\"most likely corrupt your database\" is a bit too much...  \n11:42\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0cjdelisle: ... I mean, having a status on a facebook wall appear after one hour for everyone it's fine. Having a design document in an intranet appear with the same delay could not be acceptable :)  \n11:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: it's certainly totally useless for a test  \n11:43\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Immediet consistancy means locking everyone out until the database becomes consistant which is unreasonable.  \n11:44\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0So some kind of eventual consistancy plan is needed, the way to make that not be a problem is to direct all requests (get and put) for a given page to a given node.  \n11:45\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Oddly enough I have some experience with this key:value stuff because I am working on a dht based dns engine in my \"free time\".  \n11:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If we had an xwiki installation on top of each node then we could use the load balancer to direct traffic to the one who's id is closest to the id of the document.  \n11:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:48\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Ofc then we can skip the cloud stuff entirely, use a little hsql installation under each one, and sync them through jgroups.  \n11:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^which I understand is not the goal ;)  \n11:50\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0cjdelisle: or use mysql replication :)  \n11:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I understood your POV. I will have to ask someone or try to dig deeper if that text should be there. IMO it complicates the XEM installation process (may confuse users). So if it isn't necessary for production, we should remove it in order to simplify the tech details for installing XEM.  \n11:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:52\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Back to the cloud thinking. Maybe I spoke too soon to say \"cassandra is the future\" but I do think key:value is. Rdbms just can never be as fast or scale as well.  \n11:53\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0key:value and eventual consistance over the whole group.  \n11:54\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But if each storage engine is also an xwiki node then it's not much of an issue as long as requests for a given page always go to a given node.  \n11:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0In addition it maximizes the effectiveness of the xwiki cache.  \n11:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But for searches, consistancy can't really be immediet.  \n11:56\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0cjdelisle: anyway, besides speculations, I think that datanucleus+JDO is a valid alternative to explore  \n11:57\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Agreed, what I'm trying to determine now is whether there is going to be compatability issues between JDO and JPA specifically XWQL.  \n12:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: from your XEM experience, the user you are granding XEM db priviledges, must be \"xwiki\" or can be another one also ? I am looking also at the hibernate config, you'll have to put the custom user there too. But besides that, is there any other constraint ?  \n12:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: can be anything  \n12:00\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0cjdelisle: AFAIK, JDO is more generic and (almost) a superset of JPA with some minor API differences, mostly in method signatures (http://db.apache.org/jdo/jdo\\_v\\_jpa.html)  \n12:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0good. I will mention that in the documentation  \n12:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0basically the only difference between XE and XEM around mysql is the target database name handling  \n12:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(around any database engine actually)  \n12:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, the way XE databases are named I guess  \n12:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0because they have to be uniquely identified  \n12:03\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Hmm so use jdo to store then query using jpaql?  \n12:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Anyway, I was thinking about storage for xwiki objects and it seems like the most eligent solution might just be to craft a java class from the xwiki class and feed it to the bytecode modifier then persist it with datanucleas.  \n12:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I will work on testing to see if this is feasable.  \n12:07\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If it works, we might get pure jpaql to behave just like xwql simply by the way we persist objects.  \n12:16\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0fmancinelli : hi  \n12:16\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0pulasthi: hi  \n12:17\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0fmancinelli : so i wenr though the data model and im now looking at XWQL  \n12:18\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so from what i understand ur datais handled as objects right  \n12:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://source.mysema.com/static/querydsl/2.1.1/reference/html/ch02.html#d0e172  \n12:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0mmmmmmm  \n12:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0make db injection impossible :)  \n12:19\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0\u00a0cjdelisle: was the link for me ?  \n12:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0pulasthi: The way it currently works is we pull data from the db and build objects.  \n12:20\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ya i understood that  \n12:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0umm sure if you like (it's sort of related)  \n12:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0We don't really store data in tables. We kind of implent an overlay database.  \n12:21\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle : so what the project wants is to replicate ur database in appengine?  \n12:21\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I assume you saw the data model?  \n12:21\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0pulashti: yes, we use hibernate ORM to persist and retrieve objects to from the DB  \n12:21\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle: ya i went though the datamodel wiki on the site  \n12:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0And you saw the tables xwikistrings, xwikiintegers xwikilongs etc. etc.  \n12:22\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle : ya  \n12:22\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0thats the mysql database right  \n12:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Since we allow the user to simply define their own classes, it was decided to mack the database instead of making a table for each class.  \n12:22\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so u pull data from it when needed and make objects  \n12:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*mock  \n12:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If we move to a key:value based storage mechanism then that will be redundant.  \n12:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes that's for mysql/hibernate  \n12:24\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so all ur data is in the mysql database or only a part of it  \n12:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0All is in the database.  \n12:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Have you seen the hibernate mapping file?  \n12:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/resources/xwiki.hbm.xml  \n12:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That explains in grusome detale how the storage mapping works.  \n12:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0There are 2 cases.  \n12:25\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ahh ok  \n12:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a01. The class is \"custom mapped\" and thus our engine made a db table for it.  \n12:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a02. The class is not custom mapped and each of it's fields (called \"properties\") are stored in the strings/integers/longs/etc tables.  \n12:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0In my opinion, if this is not the best solution then we shouldn't hold on to it for historical reasons.  \n12:29\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so is mirating to app engine kind of a solution to this  \n12:29\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0the way data is handled will be chaged a bit there right  \n12:30\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it's important that we don't migrate in such a way that we become locked in to the app engine.  \n12:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0bigtable looks nice but all of that niceness means we would make ourselves incompatable.  \n12:31\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so the implenetaion should in a way you can jump out of the app engine if needed  \n12:31\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0without being completety app engine specific  \n12:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform\\_2\\_2/appengine/support.html  \n12:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I think this was mentioned in the proposal.  \n12:34\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0hmm  \n12:35\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so one question since u said u where deciding on the way to implement the project i mean what layers to use and frameworks to use  \n12:35\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0what should i include in my proposal  \n12:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0all of the answers of course ;)  \n12:36\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ino i mean i want be needing to write about those things  \n12:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Umm, I think what we are looking for is a proposal which shows some engineering that the parts will indeed fit together.  \n12:37\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ok thanks for ur time  \n12:37\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0still there some more reading to do  \n12:37\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0:)  \n12:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Well, kick around, I'm reading about this today aswell.  \n12:38\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0till i see pink elephents  \n12:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0we can bounce ideas off eachother.  \n12:38\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0great  \n12:38\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0have u considered objectify  \n12:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0that only happens when you read .java files inside of xwiki-core ;)  \n12:38\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ya i was refering to the .java u gave  \n12:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0where do I find information about it?  \n12:39\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ahh ill give a link just a se  \n12:39\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0c  \n12:39\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/  \n12:39\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0its a framework that runs on the app engine data api  \n12:39\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0it makes it much simpler  \n12:40\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0to query and stuff  \n12:40\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0pulasthi: saw it yesterday. looks interesting  \n12:40\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0oh, another thing:  \n12:40\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/DynamicCustomMapping  \n12:40\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That's a description of how some of the magic inside of XWikiHibernateStore.java works.  \n12:41\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0fmancinelli: ya it made my app engine projects a lot easier  \n12:41\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0:)  \n12:43\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has quit  \n12:44\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:44\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle:: thanks ill check it  \n12:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/wiki/Concepts this is indeed interesting. It is JDO which seems to do what we want quite well.  \n12:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The question though is how would we go about switching to EG Amazon?  \n12:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0cjdelisle: Is XWIKI-6189 still valid?  \n12:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I have not checked since 3.0 was released, I hope it's not.  \n12:49\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle: i think that wasent asked from me \" Is XWIKI-6189 still valid\" ?  \n12:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0indeed it was not.  \n12:50\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0\"EG Amazon\" u mean if u want to switch from app engine to amazon  \n12:50\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0:-/  \n12:51\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I think the goal is to be platform independent.  \n12:52\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ahh well have to look into that a little more  \n12:52\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Which in the case of objectify would mean it would be part of the \"app engine plugin\".  \n12:53\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0hmm it runs on the app engine api i mean it converts querys to work on app engine  \n12:54\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0And it provides a somewhat standardized interface.  \n12:54\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ya  \n12:54\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Unfortunately google offered a few things such as Key which are not available in vanilla JDO.  \n12:54\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0These can be \"incompatability traps\"  \n12:55\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ohhh :-/  \n12:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0This is why there was the talk about datanucleas.  \n12:56\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0if not what would be the best option  \n12:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It claims to smooth over incompatabilities between google, amazon, rdbms, etc.  \n12:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform\\_2\\_2/datastores.html  \n12:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0have a look.  \n12:57\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ok :)  \n12:57\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so it provied converstion to all those stuff  \n12:57\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n12:58\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0sort of :)  \n12:58\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0\u00a0cjdelisle: ok ill look into it tonight  \n12:58\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0:)  \n12:58\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0the devil is in the detales:  \n12:58\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\"Yes, but all candidates retrieved from datastore, and then evaluated in-memory \"  \n12:58\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That means that functionality will become slooow instead of being completely broken.  \n12:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But if it's rairly used functionality then that might be a reasonable tradeoff.  \n12:59\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ohh so theres a preformance issue  \n13:00\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0but i think its better than to be stuck in one platform  \n13:00\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The problem is to do a \"select document where document.name = .....\" you would have to load every document and do a look at them all.  \n13:01\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:01\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0:-/  \n13:01\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0instead of passing it to the database and letting it do it's magic.  \n13:01\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0wow that is little too much :/  \n13:02\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0isnt there a way around it?  \n13:03\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0that would be a serious performance issue if there is lot of data related  \n13:03\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Well there are multiple ways around it, each have their own problems.  \n13:04\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0One solution is to integrate with google's bigtable db (there's a plugin for datanucleus to work with google bigtable)  \n13:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0This plugin only provides limited functionality though.  \n13:05\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so cant we like use it for some part only  \n13:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://datanucleus.blogspot.com/2010/01/gaej-and-jdojpa.html  \n13:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0In this blog post the DN people complain about how they tried to get google to implement what they could and flag what they couldn't so that it would be implemented slow by DN.  \n13:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Apparently a patch was proposed but still has not been applied.  \n13:07\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ahh  \n13:07\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so to go around the limitaions and get better performance at the same time  \n13:07\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ofc if push came to shove we might apply such a patch ourselves.  \n13:07\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0hmm ok :)  \n13:08\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0And to add one more thing into the mix, there is a \"database\" called cassandra.  \n13:08\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ahh ive heard of it  \n13:09\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0nver worked with it though  \n13:09\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0its kind of jdo stlye right  \n13:09\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I have not read up on it much yet, I see some big names are using it.  \n13:09\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ya its quit popular  \n13:10\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It seems basically like a database that replicates like a bittorrent file.  \n13:10\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0one of my frends worked a project on it and he mentiond that i was really good  \n13:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0So one path I can imagine is having a dozen xwiki installations spread around the world and each one sits atop a cassandra node.  \n13:11\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so u guys still havent decided to use casendra of DN  \n13:11\u00a0<jamesxu>\u00a0has quit  \n13:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0oh hehe  \n13:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0https://github.com/tnine/Datanucleus-Cassandra-Plugin/  \n13:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0DN is pretty flexable  \n13:12\u00a0<jamesxu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:12\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ohh cool  \n13:12\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0its got every thing it seems  \n13:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yea, that always makes me edgy.

It would be great if anyone would guide me on this project.  \n19:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: first git question ;) : there is remaining projects to move from platform to rendering and commons-core, since theses are in different repositories on github is there a way to move them cleanly ?  \n19:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0anurup: Hi, any particular questions?  \n19:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: Which projects?  \n19:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0a lot of them platform core are candidate form commons, we just moved rendering dependencies for 3.0  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0same thing for macros  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all script macros can be moved etc...  \n19:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: not that easily  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/form/for\\*/  \n19:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there needs to be substantial changes first  \n19:23\u00a0<anurup>\u00a0sdumitriu: Hi , yes . it was mentioned in the project page about \"storing the event objects anywhere in the wiki\". i didn't quite understand that  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: for some yes but there is that can be moved as it is  \n19:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for moving the script macros we need to move classloader firt and to move it it needs to be pslit in 2  \n19:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes but spli it in two is not substantial changed and my question is how do we move them when we move them because we will  \n19:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0anurup: You should try using XWiki a bit, and then try installing, using and looking through the code for the calendar application  \n19:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not planning to do it today (which is mostly why i ask because I could have done it on svn otherwise ;))  \n19:26\u00a0<anurup>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok i'll give that a try and get back to you  \n19:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol, tmortagne: Git allows to move subtrees between repositories, it's not very simple, but it can be done at any point  \n19:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0(I've made some scripts to help me extract clean repositories  \n19:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok was kind of expecting that anything can be done with git but just wanted to be sure :)  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I've had a lot of fun extracting an application and a plugin from two different repositories, then combining them into a single repository  \n19:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Now I'm not afraid of anything in git :)  \n19:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0:)  \n19:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:04\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<zubair\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<zubair\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<zubair\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:42\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:28\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:31\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0has quit  \n21:34\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:44\u00a0<vladikoff>\u00a0has quit  \n21:44\u00a0<vladikoff>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:53\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:09\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:38\u00a0<vinhai>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:39\u00a0<vinhai>\u00a0has quit  \n22:42\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has quit  \n22:47\u00a0<ihalip>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:47\u00a0<ihalip>\u00a0has quit  \n22:47\u00a0<ihalip>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:09\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has quit  \n23:12\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0has quit  \n23:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:38\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
