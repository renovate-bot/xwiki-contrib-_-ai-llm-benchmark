The field is just plain white without content. Do I need to reinstall the paket? What else can i do. Perhaps I deselected a xar document? But i upgraded to 5.0.2 with deselecting the main documents, which areexplained on the upgrade page. The activity stream is still empty.  \n19:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi rauds  \n19:57\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, the activity stream is only going to display something if there is activity  \n19:57\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Try to change a document  \n19:57\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Also, after an upgrade previous activity is going to be hidden, that's kind of a bug  \n20:24\u00a0<rauds>\u00a0Hi Sergiu, Thank you for the tip. I tried it with a new blog and changes in a space. The stream is still blank. Can i restart/reinstall the modul manual? I can't find it in the extensions.  \n20:25\u00a0<rauds>\u00a0Can i find somwhere a status about extensions?  \n20:28\u00a0<rauds>\u00a0I found the XWiki Platform - Activity Stream - UI in the installed extensions. WIll it help to reinstall it?  \n20:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:01\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has quit  \n21:07\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:43\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has quit  \n21:49\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:50\u00a0<rauds>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:06\u00a0<rauds>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:18\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:29\u00a0<rauds>\u00a0has quit\n"}
