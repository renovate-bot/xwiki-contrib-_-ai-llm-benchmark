(I think so)  \n09:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, would be good, for search only  \n09:45\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0re XWIKI-9270, it's not complicated, but I'm not fully sure about having a checkbox on the search filter, because it's not a filter.. Best would be to have a user preference, but it's more work.  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I don't like the user pref too much on my side  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because IMO it doesn't depend on the type of user you are  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but on what you're looking for  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but having both could work  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a default depending on the type of user + ability to override that in the search  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I feel the same should be available for hidden docs but that's another discussion  \n09:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(having to chage your user profile back and forth to see hidden documents and then remove it because you're done is apain)  \n09:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sure  \n09:51\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(I agree about hidden documents)  \n10:00\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:01\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0Hi Everyone .... I guess the release of xwiki5.1 is currently in progress, so I wonder if someone has a time to discuss the state of two pull requests, or if I better should return tomorrow.  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: hi, yeah a bit busy but shoot :) We always like PR! ;)  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0camil7: tomorrow is Bug Fixing Day (every Thursday). Are they bug fixes? :)  \n10:03\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0Yes, they are bug fixes ... or should be, at least ;)  \n10:03\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0we are not sure if we can fix all problems with them tomorrow  \n10:04\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0they are about a bugfix for http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7403 (Watchlist mails sometimes in wrong language) ... which seems not to be the fix you expected  \n10:05\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0and some Lucene search related fix XWIKI-9232 - well, I wonder if there is still interest in that  \n10:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: yes for XWIKI-9232 the best would probably to test the new Solr search with the same use case, there has been a lot of work on locales compared to the lucene module  \n10:11\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, just need to figure out how to set up out outlandish analyzer in that case ... that has been hampering us so far  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: for de there is one already  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you have a page in german it will be analyzed as such  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: the default Solr setup \"generated\" by XWiki can be found on https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-search/xwiki-platform-search-solr/xwiki-platform-search-solr-api/src/main/resources/solr  \n10:14\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, ok, then its kinda automatically , so no wonder I could not find the configuration options ;)  \n10:14\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ok, looking there, thanks  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and more specifically for various supported locales https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-search/xwiki-platform-search-solr/xwiki-platform-search-solr-api/src/main/resources/solr/conf/lang  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and once XWiki \"installed\" Solr you can configure it the way you want or use your own Solr instance  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which makes modifications a lot easier  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basicaly XWiki is just doing XWiki stuff now ;)  \n10:26\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0btw it does not look like the Solr-search has the same problem with hidden document settings, but I better try to see what the query is  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: the hidden document information is stored in the Sorl index and depending on your user configuration is filtered or not  \n10:29\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, it is just that the query should not flex \"hidden:false\" to \"hidden:fals\" in that case, just because it things it should apply German stemming rules  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: that field is a \"string\" which mean no analyze, all analyze is configured field by field in Solr  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-search/xwiki-platform-search-solr/xwiki-platform-search-solr-api/src/main/resources/solr/conf/schema.xml  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0each predefined field has a type  \n10:31\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, then I should better not check the query, as no problem, there, but trust Solr not to mess with the field there  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and localized fields are store in <fieldprefix>\\_<locale> fields  \n10:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes now we have to hope Solr does not have bugs since we gave it some stuff we used to do ourself  \n10:32\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0actually it \"allmoust\" works for me, I am just looking why it finds everything but the start page .... local problem for sure ...  \n10:36\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, thanks for the pointers, I will report back for sure if I find something  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: I'm looking at https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/116/files now, trying to understand if it's the right fix  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks good  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only worry is that you don't revet it at the end  \n10:37\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0vmallso: thanks for looking; I guess we have a \u00a0slight disagrement over where the fix should  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and context isn't cloned  \n10:38\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, we thought it is .... but in some level higher up  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0look:  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the code htere's:  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0context.setURLFactory(new ExternalServletURLFactory(context));   \n10:38\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0then, it maybe should eb cloned again in the method itself to be sure  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is correctly put back in a finally block  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you added the setLanguage  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to also put back the original one  \n10:38\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, or finally block, yes  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in that finally block  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as otherwise it'll affect callers  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the context isn't cloned  \n10:40\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0we have been sure that in the way it is currenlty called via the watchlist plugin the context is cloned by the caller ... but as it is a public method, of course all other possible callers might have a \u00a0different ideas about their context  \n10:41\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0so we will update the pull request by saving the language and putting it back in the finally block, that should be easy enough ;)  \n10:41\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0we just have not figured out how to write tests for that .... need too much components mocking up  \n10:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: also using Locale based API would be cleaner  \n10:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0setLocale/getLocale  \n10:42\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, but we do not get in the locale here .... well, we could fetch a Locale object on our own for the string passed in, but that will just make the code longer, I feel  \n10:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: mostly talking about the code you will add before and after to save and restore the current locale  \n10:43\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0changing the \"String lang\" in the argument list to a Locale object would be an API change, and I guess that is verboten  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes that would need a new API to be perfect since currently the parameter is String language aTM  \n10:44\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, ok, now understood, yes ...  \n10:44\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, for saving the old locale we can use the setLocale/getLocale, micht also add a comment why this saves the \"language\", too  \n10:46\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: indeed a unit test is not very useful here since it'll just test that setLanguage is called  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm OTOH you cannot mock XWikiVelocityRenderer since it's static apparently  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is bad practice btw, some old code)  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in practice this could easily be modified to use velocityManager.getVelocityEngine().evaluate  \n10:49\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, we also wondered how to avoid actually sending mails when calling \u00a0sendMailFromTemplate  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well you could do an integration test  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and use greenmail as we use in other tests  \n10:50\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but the velocity renderer, yes, I vaguely remember we ran into that, too  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes it's not easy  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is very old code  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using the old plugin technology  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this code needs to be rewritten as a component  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so not sure it's worth the effort for you to write an integration test  \n10:53\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0I am not so ready to rewrite this to a component till tomorrow ;)  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw tdelafosse do you plan to finish your mail sender component refactoring at some point? :)  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: \u00a0actually tdelafosse started on this  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but he dropped it AFAIK  \n10:54\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, if it is ok for you, we will only update the setLocale thing, and try to get away without a test for now  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sounds fine for now  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:55\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no, thanks to you!  \n10:56\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0vmassol : my mail sender works fine, but I'm afraid it needs some refactoring for following the best practice  \n10:57\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0I would try to do it this summer  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah that would be cool  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(make sure you verify the language is set correctly ;))  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks evalica :)

are not currently searched when type is DOCUMENT  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok  \n15:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0xproperties also  \n15:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sburjan: properties are part of objects and objects are searched for documents  \n15:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0mflorea: I can't find annotations or comments when type is Document  \n15:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0did you tried other objects?  \n15:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0no. only these 2  \n15:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0then you can't say it's the same for all xproperties  \n15:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0no  \n15:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but these 2 are pretty important IMO  \n15:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0mflorea: it seems to be working if I create a custom class.  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: \"these 2\" are the same class and there is no special filter for them AFAIK, if you can reproduce it easily and your document can be found by searching for its title then create a jira issue

\n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01.521 + plugins updates  \n17:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n17:23\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0is there any way to pull in all groups from Active Directory and make them XWiki groups, instead of having to explicitly specify them in the config file?  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't know, I'm not a ldap user, others might know  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: fyi this is what I did: https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/wiki/CoverageCheckConfigUpgrade  \n17:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0jbwiv: I guess it is not possible, because one does not know how to map the ldap group names to the xwiki group names  \n17:36\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0jbwiv: \u00a0have not really checked the code, however  \n17:37\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0camil7: ok, thanks  \n17:45\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0jbiwiv: \u00a0in principle there is something like \u00a0XWikiLDAPUtils.syncGroupsMembership(String xwikiUserName, String userDN, Map<String, Set<String>> groupMappings, XWikiContext context) \u00a0.... one could write a plugin which calles that method, if one knows about the AD-Group -> XWikiGroup name mapping in advance  \n17:45\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but I guess that might cause trouble, because I see the ldap group name is not stored on the XWiki Group object, so this might get out of sync :-/  \n17:46\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0(unless I am very mistaken)  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: the group name is not stored in the object because the authrnticator is based on a configuration  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have to indicate in the configuration which LDAP group is linked to which XWiki group  \n17:48\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, then it will not work anyway to sync the groups programatically  \n17:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what you could do is generate a configuration programatically  \n17:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the configuration does not have to be in xwiki.cfg you can also put in in XWikiPreferences (but then it's only for the wiki and not the whole farm)  \n17:51\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0do LDAP groups not show up until the first user who is a member logs in? I was having a lot of problems getting one to show, but after logging in as a user which auth'd against LDAP (and not logging in as Admin) it's suddenly there  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: you have a bunch of ldap\\_\\* field in there  \n17:51\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0very weird  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fields  \n17:51\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, I remember :)  \n17:51\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0I've also enabled DEBUG for the two ldap logback sections, but not seeming to get debug info in the logs  \n17:52\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ldap\\_group\\_mapping \u00a0sure it is  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jbwiv: that's an authenticator, it's working only for the user currently login in  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no sync sheduler or things like this  \n17:52\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, so if I add a group in the config file, that group won't show up in XWiki until the first user from that group logins in?  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jbwiv: by default yes  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well not exactly  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are supposed to put existing groups in there  \n17:54\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0jbwiv: I guess tmortagne has the right idea, \u00a0somehow writing to the ldap\\_group\\_mapping \u00a0should work ...  \n17:54\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0it's weird, because I added two groups  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but the group won't be filled  \n17:54\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0one showed up, but the other wouldn't show up  \n17:54\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0then I logged in as a user \\*in\\* that group, and it magically showed up  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n17:54\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0the other group showed without logging in at all  \n17:54\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0and has 0 members  \n17:54\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, that \"addGroupToUser\" \u00a0sync creates the groups on th fly  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the authenticator only work around the user  \n17:54\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0but the second group wouldn't show \\*until\\* I logged in, which now has one members because I did so  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it does not need a group it won't touch it  \n17:55\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0not sure why the other group showed up magically, it should not  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically it's job is to update the user mamebershipt  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0membership  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not synchronize the group  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you will only see that user added or removed from the groups  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nothing else  \n17:55\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0ok, so if I want to create a group and shape its permissions, I can do that first, but then add the mapping to that group in the config file later to allow users to get that group up authentication with AD  \n17:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if what you want a background synchronization the best IMO is to write one  \n17:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0based on the scheduler plugin  \n17:56\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0ok, think I understand. thanks  \n17:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and disable membership sync in the authenticator  \n17:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think there is a something like this on extensions.xwiki.org  \n17:57\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0one more quick question. are you aware of any plugin which will allow users to insert images via cut/paste or direct upload? It seems like an unnecessary extra step to first attach an image to the document and only \\*then\\* be able to insert the image in the document  \n17:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP+Tools have something like this  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(talking about synchronization scheduler)  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0reading you last question now :)  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jbwiv: the wysiwyg does that AFAIK  \n17:58\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0tmortagne: I don't think so  \n17:58\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0at least in our tests  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe not copy/paste you I think you can directly insert image  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea ?  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/you/but/  \n17:59\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0when you click the \"Image\" button in WYSIWYG, I only get \"Attached Image\" and \"External Image\".  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes click on attached image  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then click on \"upload image\"  \n18:00\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0yes, and when I click \"Upload image\", nothing happens  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0double click  \n18:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no  \n18:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yo need to click select  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's because it's selected  \n18:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the button  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the ui is bit misleading  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I got tricked too  \n18:01\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0oh, weird  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jbwiv: feel free to create an improvement jira :)  \n18:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0jbwiv: but to answer your question, no, there is no plugin to paste images. Implementing http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-278 would be a first step  \n18:03\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0ok, cool. thanks guys.  \n18:03\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0One \\*final\\* question for the day. are there any limitations to embedded groovy scripts? For example, could I connect to other databases from an embedded groovy script?  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*groovy script macro  \n18:04\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0ok, great. thanks!  \n18:06\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0woops. ok this time I really promise, but I do have one other question. We have Tags showing up on our front page which point to objects in a wiki space which is not visible to just any user. so, you see those tags when you're not logged in, but clicking them takes you nowhere. logging in as a user with visibility to that space will allow you to go to what the tags point to. this is obviously undesirable, as tags should only be visible to those who can use   \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jbwiv: looks like a possible bug, IMO you should report it in jira  \n18:08\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0vmassol: ok, will do  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: did you change anyhing regarding deprecations, I see a lot more than before now (not talking about DeprecatedContext)  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex:  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02013-07-03 17:48:06,001 [http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/WebHome] WARN \u00a0o.x.v.i.DefaultVelocityEngine \u00a0- Deprecated usage of method [com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki.countDocuments] in xwiki:Blog.BlogSheet@165,29  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember seeing those before  \n18:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-422  \n18:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha that's something else  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0strange jira with an issue id in the title :)  \n18:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I deprecated this method and all the search methods in XWiki  \n18:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I copy pasted an old one I need to fix it  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok didn't realize you had deprecated them  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's going to generate tons of logs  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I hope it won't slow down too much xwiki instances on farms like xwiki.org myxwiki.org  \n18:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but we had to deprecate them some day, the query plugin/service exist since forever  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it'll probaby be a while before we fix them all  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but it's a bit strange to deprecate and have our newest code still using htem  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which means it's fine if we remove them all before we release 5.2 final  \n18:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if we wait for them to all be fixed they will simply never be fixed  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if not it would be a bit strange  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks at how many $context use I fixed found and the other ones you fixed...  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's easy to fix  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0except for extensions  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but it means that if we don't make it deprecated it's never fixed  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure sure  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a big difference  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0between we fix it it in our code  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we make it visible to users  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I were using XWiki  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as is  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I would see a lot of Warnings in the logs  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it woudlb't please me as a user  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I would say: \"what's this software with problems\" :)  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is only one question for me: is it right to use those method instead of the query service ?  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what define a deprecated method  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes but think about users, they're important too :)  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0technically you're right ofc  \n18:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0how are they going to know that using theses method is not right ?  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not the problem  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that we are wrong and we release wrong software  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if they are deprecated, if not we are not wrong (yet)  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is maybe in the way these are reported  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and we are going to be wrong a long time without those warnings...  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0look at parseMessage that you deprecated  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we still get a lot of warnings about them  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's been 2-3 years  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's quite bad  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so deprecating without a strategy is not good IMO  \n18:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the only one in that case and it's because there is no alternative that it's not yet fixed  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now if we say:  \n18:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is direct alternative to the XWiki search methods  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's all agree that we fix all search warnings in 5.2 then it's ok  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but not easy to use  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well depends if you convert to XWQL or not  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is hql too  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not harder to use  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes which is why I say it depends if you want to also use XWQL at the same time  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since HQL is also kind ofdeprecated  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I would prefer that we don't release final versions to users where they keep seeing tons of warnings in the console  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if we can fix them before 5.2 final then good  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at least in our code, for extensions it's a bit harder and we'll let devs of those extensions update them)  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we also said that we're never going to remove APIs so I'm not sure we need to deprecate them since deprecate means they're going to be removed at some point  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway food for thoughts  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/API/scripting API  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess it's my past that's surfacing\u2026 :)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I was working in HongKong on the metro software  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and there was a constant flow of warning and errors displayed in the logs of the sowftare  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I had to know which ones were real warnings/errors and which one were not important ones and \"normal\" ones  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and doing this between 1AM to 4.30AM every 2 nights....  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the trains being stopped if I made a mistake  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since that time I vowed to myself I'd never do that in software I develop  \n18:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0is the Tags capability driven by a groovy snippet or something else? I'd like to take a look at the code to see how it's written before I file a Jira. any pointers to the code or what that widget might be technically called are appreciated  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jbwiv: it's in Main.Tags I think  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags for ex  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?viewer=code  \n18:27\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0ok, cool. thanks  \n18:27\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0I wonder if what I'm seeing is expected behavior?  \n18:30\u00a0<npm\\_\\_>\u00a0is now known as <npm>  \n18:39\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0depends on the expectation, I guess ;)  \n18:40\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0\u00a0camil7 what I would expect is that if a space where tagged content exists to a user is not visible, the tag won't be visible either  \n18:41\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0in other words, if there are two documents tagged with \"wiki\", but both of those documents are in a space which isn't visible to me, I shouldn't even see that tag in my tag cloud  \n18:42\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, if you click on that tag, you do not get a list of pages for that \"secret\" tag however ?  \n18:42\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0I guess the HQL query listing the tags does not fully exclude them ...  \n18:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bb in 1 hour  \n18:48\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0jbwiv: \u00a0I cannot find it in the code at the moment, but I feel this is bug, too  \n18:48\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0might be tricky to fix it without performance going in the cellar for tags  \n18:49\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0camil7: correct, you don't get a list of the secret pages if you click it. still, having it visible pollutes the user's tag cloud, especially in a large, segmented wiki  \n18:49\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0camil7: ok, I'll try to think of ways to work around if for now  \n18:51\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0jbwiv: ah, ok, maybe I will send a patch to fix it \u00a0.... but not today, its a bad sign when I do not find the relevant code within five minutes :-/  \n18:51\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0jbwiv: would be interesting to hear about the workaround in any case  \n18:51\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0camil7: lol. ok. thanks for your help  \n18:51\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0jbwiv: ok, I'll definitely keep you posted  \n18:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:17\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:53\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n21:21\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0so I'm looking at Main.Tags, and in the source there's an eventual call to {{tagcloud/}}. How can I find the source to this?  \n21:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jbwiv: it's a macro defined in http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/TagCloud  \n21:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0replace by your server and edit in object mode  \n21:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0check the WikiMacroClass object  \n21:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to see all wiki macros defined in wiki pages: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/WikiMacros  \n21:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:26\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0vmassol: cool...thanks!  \n21:27\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0so maybe the answer for us is to simply not display the tag cloud on the main landing page.  \n21:27\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0I think then it would only be visible within each space, which probably does what i want  \n21:35\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:38\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n22:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:41\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0I know you can \"Add Page from Office\".
