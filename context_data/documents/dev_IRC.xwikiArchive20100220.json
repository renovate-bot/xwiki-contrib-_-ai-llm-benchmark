It's more the rdfa parsers I have that apply that to literals, when they should not be. Bug in parsers really  \nbblfish - (15:31): but in rdfa it ends up giving literals a language tag  \nbblfish - (15:31): (unless they specify that they don't want them)  \nbblfish - (15:32): so if a japanese person puts his name down, I'd end up saying that his foaf:name is \"some japanese chars\"@en  \nbblfish - (15:33): (that would be wrong)  \nsdumitriu - (15:33): Indeed  \nbblfish - (15:33): so that's something to think about longer term...  \nbblfish - (15:36): is it possible to switch that off? Until the parsers get fixed?  \nbblfish - (15:40): in any case I'd like to have a more fine grain control on setting the language of the literals  \nbblfish - (15:43): btw: if you are interested this is the rdfa doc: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/#sec\\_6.3.1. search for xml:lang  \nsdumitriu - (16:02): For the moment you can remove it from the template  \nsdumitriu - (16:02): htmlheader.vm  \nbblfish - (16:02): let me look  \nbblfish - (16:03): I suppose that's in a template somewhere...  \nbblfish - (16:03): It's not in /xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiUserProfileSheet  \nsdumitriu - (16:03): No  \nsdumitriu - (16:03): On the filesystem  \nbblfish - (16:07): ok, thanks.  \nvmassol left at 16:11 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 16:45  \nflaviusolaru - (17:02): quick inquire...  \nflaviusolaru - (17:02): what about multilanguage objects?  \nflaviusolaru - (17:03): just like xwikidocuments have translations.. why not for object properties values  \nflaviusolaru - (17:04): we could have a multilingual Blog  \nsdumitriu - (17:04): It's envisioned, but no plans at the moment  \nflaviusolaru - (17:05): what needs to be done?  \nflaviusolaru - (17:06): extending the object editor...?  \nsdumitriu - (17:06): Nope  \nsdumitriu - (17:06): The whole database/storage part  \nsdumitriu - (17:07): At the moment you can do a trick  \nsdumitriu - (17:07): Have a language property in the class  \nsdumitriu - (17:07): And have several objects, one for each language  \nsdumitriu - (17:07): And then just get the object for the current language  \nflaviusolaru - (17:08): a translation of a xwikidocument... how is represented in db?  \nflaviusolaru - (17:09): doesn't have a XWD\\_ID or something like that?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:09): Objects are represented by document fullname.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:09): instead of id.  \nsdumitriu - (17:10): One row for each translation  \nsdumitriu - (17:10): Translations have the same name, space, fullName  \nsdumitriu - (17:10): Then there are 3 fields  \nsdumitriu - (17:10): translatin, language, default\\_language  \nsdumitriu - (17:11): translation = 0 for default document, 1 for translations  \nflaviusolaru - (17:11): so by linking the objects to xwikidocument id instead of fullname can fix this  \nsdumitriu - (17:11): default\\_language is the language of the default document, and is defined only for the default document  \nsdumitriu - (17:11): language is the language of the translation, and is defined only for translations  \nsdumitriu - (17:12): The id is computed as hash of fullName + translation  \nsdumitriu - (17:12): Yes, in theory using the doc ID could make objects link to translations instead of the whole document  \nsdumitriu - (17:13): In practice, all current queries would need to be changed  \nsdumitriu - (17:13): Plus, this is a major model change  \nsdumitriu - (17:13): Which would break lots of applications  \nflaviusolaru - (17:16): damn... this is really bad  \nflaviusolaru - (17:16): maybe adding language to objects  \nflaviusolaru - (17:17): ?  \nsdumitriu - (17:17): Maybe  \nsdumitriu - (17:17): I'd rather have this configurable for each property  \nflaviusolaru - (17:18): that is a good ideea too  \nflaviusolaru - (17:18): even better  \nsdumitriu - (17:18): So instead of having all objects translatable, each property in the class can specify if it should be translated or not  \nflaviusolaru - (17:18): +1  \nsdumitriu - (17:18): Then, the language field is added to properties  \nflaviusolaru - (17:19): i'm more for this since there sa many properties that doesn't need translation  \nflaviusolaru - (17:19): \\*there are  \nflaviusolaru - (17:20): this would require some changes.. and a few in API  \nflaviusolaru - (17:22): thanks sergiu  \nsdumitriu - (17:27): You're welcome  \nhcross left #xwiki at 17:37  \noxi joined #xwiki at 18:20  \noxi - (18:20): hi  \nsdumitriu - (18:20): Hi  \noxi - (18:20): does XWiki still run fine on Apache Derby/JavaDB/Cloudscape RDBMS?

 \noxi - (18:21): is that still up to date?  \noxi - (18:22): will XWiki take care of the SQL DDL Schema creation?  \nsdumitriu - (18:22): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (18:22): Tables are created automatically  \noxi - (18:22): wow  \noxi - (18:22): very nice :-)  \nsdumitriu - (18:23): We didn't try it lately, but nobody reported problems with it  \noxi - (18:23): thanks a lot, sdumitriu  \nsdumitriu - (18:23): You're welcome  \noxi - (18:23): I'll give it a try :-)  \nsdumitriu - (18:24): If you encounter any problems, you can report on the mailing list  \nsdumitriu - (18:24): http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/MailingLists  \noxi - (18:24): is it possible, that Derby support might be dropped in future?  \nsdumitriu - (18:24): Nope  \noxi - (18:24): I mean do I risk loosing support for future features?  \noxi - (18:24): good  \nsdumitriu - (18:24): Actually we were even considering making it the default database instead of HSQL  \noxi - (18:24): yeah, please consider that  \noxi - (18:25): I've had very good experience with derby in >5 projects  \noxi - (18:25): it might be a little slower than HSQL  \noxi - (18:25): but it's very robust  \noxi - (18:26): is there any hope for a book to come out soon?  \nsdumitriu - (18:27): Nothing planned for the near future  \noxi - (18:27): thanks  \nsdumitriu - (18:27): But it would be nice to try to reproduce the community sprints done by other projects  \noxi - (18:28): yeah, indeed  \noxi - (18:28): what's the best alternative to xwiki?  \noxi - (18:28): and what makes xwiki unique?  \noxi - (18:28): I'm sorry for the direct questions  \noxi - (18:29): I felt like the choice comes down to xwiki or confluence  \noxi - (18:29): and I prefer to give xwiki a try :-)  \nsdumitriu - (18:30): Yes, Confluence is the main competitor  \noxi - (18:30): okay  \nsdumitriu - (18:30): I mean on the target market  \noxi - (18:30): yeah, sure  \nsdumitriu - (18:30): But XWiki is Open Source  \nsdumitriu - (18:31): Hm, scratch that  \noxi - (18:31): I'm thinking of building a Sofa :-)  \nsdumitriu - (18:31): But XWiki is Way Better  \noxi - (18:31): ....
