Glad you like it. We still have a lot of work to do though ;)  \n12:54\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0vmassol, I recently became depressed by my company's giant monlithic codebase.  \n12:54\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0It's even based on ant.  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah that was the case on xwiki too when I joined the project back in 2006  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki was also on Ant at the time ;-  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we still have some trace of this monomothic code in xwiki-platform-oldcore  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after 6+ years we still haven't finished the move  \n12:55\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0How did you do it?  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0slowly over time without breaking anything  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is why it took so long  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no revolution, just evolution keeping backward compat  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we already had users and we didn't want to break them  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0various strategies  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example for the rendering  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we decided to not touch as the exisitng rendering and to make xwiki polyglot  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this allowed us to call the existing syntx XWiki 1.0 and introduce XWiki 2.0  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in the process this gave us the opportunity to support a lot of other syntaxes  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's just one example of a strategy  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then we used the legacy module strategy  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DevelopmentPractices#HBackwardCompatibility)  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lunch time here! :) have fun  \n12:58\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0vmassol, Can you come back and continue?  \n13:09\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:22\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0vmassol, I guess you must have required a high degree of autonomy and trust from xwiki company since it requires management to trust you enough not to tell you what to do on a regular basis.  \n13:22\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0in other words, closed allocation for you.  \n14:10\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Lack of autonomy is a big issue in applying modularity in my job.  \n16:15\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:27\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:04\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n21:05\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n22:09\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:34\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n23:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
