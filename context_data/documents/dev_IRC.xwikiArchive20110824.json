 \n11:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0to see an example of how to use test-ui framework from another project  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: no, only tests-ui  \n11:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(should probably be moved)  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ok let us know what you find and then we can decide what we do  \n11:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: +1 to move  \n11:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think I will wait for tomorrow for that since it's the right day for it ;)  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok\u2026. could you look at binding the sel1 tests to an agent using FF 3.x?  \n11:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0was talking about the move not the convert, right now I will see how to quickly directly reuse test-ui  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok  \n11:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we have an agent still on FF 3 ?  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n11:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but FF 3.x is still there on all machines  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n11:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I can maybe start with that at least  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we might want in the future to have different browsers/versions installed on different agents  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order to test different combinations  \n11:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep but there is not much reason to test old FF version  \n11:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but other browsers yes  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well first we need to define our browser version strategy  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(discussion of yesterday)  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(sburjan` is handling it and will make a proposal)  \n11:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0here the issue is not related to XWiki  \n11:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok lets go back to FF3 on lets say agent4  \n11:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok with you ?  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok\u2026. might be good to change the agent name in jenkins to reflect the browser on that agetn  \n11:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i'm putting a label  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0something like agent1 (FF6), agent4 (FF3.x)  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but I mean when we'll look at build failures we'll need to remmeber that information  \n11:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but you can see the version of FF in the log  \n11:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0at the begining  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(was just an idea to make it easy and not have to navigate to agent definition page)  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok  \n11:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think  \n11:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n11:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm actually not sure  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still might be good to have a global overview of our agents  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0agent1-N isn't very descriptive  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I togh the path was displayed  \n11:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0tough  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ok when they're all similar but starts to fall short when they're not  \n11:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe there is a jenkins plugin to automatically add labels after the names of the agent  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe  \n11:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok even just a setup  \n11:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0agent-4 moved to FF3, tying selenium1 based project on it  \n11:48\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems to be working  \n12:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: souldn't we remove xwiki-enterprise-tests job ?
