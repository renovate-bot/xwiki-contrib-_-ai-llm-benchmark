And re db properties, I did not want to duplicate db driver version. Anyway, it's livable :)  \n11:03\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0btw, I had a lot of problems while building the svn trunk  \n11:04\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the bigest one was that some projects have (mostly runtime dependencies) set to intervals like [2.7,)  \n11:04\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but I`m building a 3.1-SNAPSHOT and maven does not seem to properly compare versions that are snapshots :)  \n11:05\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0or [2.7-milestone-2,) which I`m guessing has the same problem.  \n11:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think that when you don't have SNAPSHOT in an interval maven does not look at SNAPSHOT  \n11:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise it would be a mess when releasing  \n11:07\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0also, if there is something like dependency version 1.62 and I`ve just built 1.63-SNAPSHOT, maven can't seem to accept the current snapshot.  \n11:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not sure what you expect, if the dependency is 1.62 maven is using 1.62 not snapshot  \n11:08\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes, you are right  \n11:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's a bit strict on versions  \n11:08\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but is it ok if we have all these problems in the SVN trunk?  \n11:08\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I mean we should have at least a building SVN trunk if we still bother on keeping it.  \n11:09\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0not to mention all the snapshots coresponsing to the SVN trunk that vanished once hudson got reconfigured (pushing me again to a local build :) )  \n11:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what is in trunk is accessible just until we are done with git but only for sources, it does not have to work  \n11:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's like we had refactored on svn directly  \n11:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you would not try to build from an older svn revision and expect it to work properly  \n11:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but I agree it's a bit confusing right now  \n11:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which is why we want to hide svn as soon as git is fully ready  \n11:12\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I`d rather say hide the trunk but keep the tags for source reference / older deployments  \n11:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0theses are supposed to be in git too  \n11:12\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0ah, ok then, even better :)  \n11:13\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0do you have a (veeery loose) ETA for the git transition stabilisation?  \n11:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you except contrib stuff it's supposed to be already done actually, wiki-manager has just been forgotten but we will have to wait for sdumitriu for it because I have no idea how it moved plugin properly from one repo to another  \n11:17\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0ah, so XEM will be building successfully after this?  \n11:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n11:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0cool  \n11:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0too bad I waisted ages building the svn trunk, but it's all for a good cause :D  \n11:18\u00a0<chanikag>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I just commented \u00a0buildnumber stuff in web-standard for it to build properly untill I find a fix for git so XE will build quickly after that  \n11:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so we should have a jenkins all blue today  \n11:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well blue or orange :)  \n11:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not red anyway :P  \n11:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0:)  \n11:30\u00a0<drake01>\u00a0has quit  \n11:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n11:36\u00a0<drake01>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<chanikag>\u00a0has quit  \n11:40\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:41\u00a0<drake01>\u00a0has quit  \n11:43\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has quit  \n11:44\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:45\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:45\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has quit  \n11:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:01\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0cjdelisle: hi  \n12:02\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0cjdelisle: i tried to get your cassandra implementation running but got a error when doing mvn clean install  \n12:03\u00a0<drake01>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Bomb news: XWiki has 3 slots  \n12:33\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: for GSoc ?  \n12:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n12:34\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I guess that's bad news  \n12:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0For the students, yes  \n12:36\u00a0<Twisted>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:36\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:39\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0sdumitriu : that is bad news :/  \n12:39\u00a0<ihalip>\u00a0ouch  \n12:41\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ihalip: did you get accepted by some organization ?
