 \n10:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0right  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I see  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0makes sense  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll just miss the initial state  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(initial content for each doc)  \n10:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0right, we'd need to have some magic to manage the switch  \n10:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Also consider shoving off all of the doc history tables into nosql, this way the sql database only holds things you actually care to query on  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's a good idea too  \n10:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm not sure if it would work well for attachments but if it existed, the FSAttach infrastructure could be fairly easily reworked to store the data elsewhere  \n10:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0then we would actually have 1 place that is authoritative...  \n10:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Fabio would love you forever when he had to setup clusters...  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Oh I was musing the other day about whether user profile pages might become nested  \n10:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0this way someone could have their own scratch-space  \n10:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0even fork/merge workflow becomes possible  \n10:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I suppose I should file that as an Idea ticket  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[WARN] Restarting myxwiki.org on 7.3 in 15min  \n10:57\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool tmortagne  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[WARN] Restarting myxwiki.org on 7.3  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0going to take a while since it's migrating databases (a loooot of databases)  \n11:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: should advertise the maintenance on https://twitter.com/myxwiki prior to doing it no?
