A nice history but the branches aren't integrated.  \nsdumitriu - (18:10): How big is the .git directory?  \ncjdelisle - (18:11): I 7ziped it and it's 500MB  \nsdumitriu - (18:11): Hm, pretty big  \ncjdelisle - (18:11): magnet:?xt=urn:btih:740ff9e1a562f588362468ce22285b1b1a3c94d3&dn=xwiki.gitClone.7z  \ncjdelisle - (18:12): Push speed out here is not that great but it'll work.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 19:05  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 19:24  \nmflorea left at 19:25 (Client Quit  \nvmassol left at 19:29 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 19:41  \ntmortagne left at 19:41 (Client Quit  \nsburjan` - (19:44): Ubuntu 1-.10 got final today :)  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 19:45  \nlucaa - (19:56): sburjan`: huh? already?  \nlucaa - (19:56): what does final mean? it's out? we can upgrade?  \nlucaa - (19:57): ah, it IS out  \nlucaa - (19:57): mmh  \nlucaa - (19:57): surprisingly early  \nlucaa - (19:57): (maybe to celebrate the day, 10.10 released on 10.10.10)  \nabusenius - (20:05): btw 101010 (bin) = 42 (dec) :)  \nlucaa - (20:07): yeah, I noticed it  \nlucaa - (20:08): maybe this ubuntu will be the answer to everything...  \nlucaa - (20:08): ;)  \nlucaa - (20:08): (pulseaudio included)  \nlucaa - (20:16): guys, I have closed XATAG-41 .
