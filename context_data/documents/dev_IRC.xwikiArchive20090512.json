I can not reach this box now. I do hope to be able to try again tomorrow.  \nsdumitriu - (12/05/2009 00:05): The idea is that on a fresh download it works fine  \nsdumitriu - (12/05/2009 00:05): And the only way to throw this exception is if the list of properties does not match the class  \nsdumitriu - (12/05/2009 00:05): So either the sheet is OK, but the class wasn't updated (very unlikely), or the sheet is wrong  \nrrodriguez - (12/05/2009 00:12): I asume the default XAR includes the whole administration application, doesn't it?  \nsdumitriu - (12/05/2009 00:12): Yes  \nrrodriguez - (12/05/2009 00:12): ok  \nrrodriguez - (12/05/2009 00:13): I'll try again ASAP. This box is not accessible from my current location. I will keep the concerned thread updated!  \nrrodriguez - (12/05/2009 00:14): Do you figure out any reason why the sheet is not updated in a fresh installation (after removing the MySQL schema and the whole webapps folder under Tomcat)  \nrrodriguez - (12/05/2009 00:14): ?  \nsdumitriu - (12/05/2009 00:14): No  \nrrodriguez - (12/05/2009 00:15): OK. I will try again and document all an each step.
