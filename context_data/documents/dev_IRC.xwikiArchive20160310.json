Issue is when i.e. /xwiki/rest/repository/extensions/ is executed as it returns \"No ExceptionMapper was found, but must be found\" which is jaxrs exception. I've enabled all kind of logs and it all comes down to this hql query  \n14:25\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0select doc from com.xpn.xwiki.doc.XWikiDocument as doc , com.xpn.xwiki.objects.BaseObject as extension where ( extension.validExtension = 1 ) and doc.fullName=extension.name and extension.className='ExtensionCode.ExtensionClass'  \n14:25\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0apparently validExtension cannot be resolved (could not resolve property: validExtension of: com.xpn.xwiki.objects.BaseObject)  \n14:25\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0does anybody have any idea what could be the issue? Thanks a lot  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: what version of repository are you talking about ?  \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0validExtension seems there on https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-repository/xwiki-platform-repository-server-ui/src/main/resources/ExtensionCode/ExtensionClass.xml#L358  \n14:30\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0latest one (7.4.2, although it's tested on 8.0-M2), class has proper fields... I've also tried to remove the extension and install it again (as the wiki was upgraded from 7.1.2), but no luck there  \n14:32\u00a0<asam>\u00a0has quit  \n14:35\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: what you pasted is the complete HQL query ?  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if this is the complete query it does not make much sense from HQL point of view which would indicate a XWQL -> HQL converter but xwiki.org is on 7.4.2 too and http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/rest/repository/extensions/ is working well  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: if you can reproduce this just by installing repository app on a standard XWiki distribution then please create an issue on http://jira.xwiki.org, If I can reproduce it should be easy to fix it  \n14:53\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: yup, this it the full stack trace - http://pastebin.com/tctsJ0Ew  \n14:54\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0let me check if I can reproduce that on clean xwiki instance  \n15:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: is this an upgrade ?  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or reporitoy app I mean  \n15:04\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:04\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: Yup, it was... but I've removed the app and installed it again (to try if something went wrong during upgrade)  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did you restarted XWiki  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0?  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the problem is that REST framework is initialized only once  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so even if you upgrade repository REST resource I think it's still using the old one  \n15:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0several times :) I also tried the query in page via $services.query  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this really sounds like a bug in the XWQL -> HQL converter but then I don't understand how this could work for xwiki.org and not for you  \n15:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway if you are able to create a jira issue with step by step of how to reproduce it I will definitely debug it (but probably not before Monday)  \n15:31\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: successfully reproduced on 8.0-Milestone-2, so i will try on the RC1  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: do you have at least one valid extension in your repository ? maybe this error is produced when there is none, that would be the difference with xwiki.org  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(still need to be fixed to return an empty list)  \n15:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0there is one and I assume it's valid... is it possible to get xar of any xwiki.org extensions for testing? Maybe it's indeed the issue  \n15:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0heh, so 8.0-rc-1 failed during subwiki creation (Allowed namespace list [wiki:(] does not matches namespace [wiki:extensions] )  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: ues it's a known issue, it's fixed now  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/ues/yes/  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: re valid extension, when it's valid it's indicated as such  \n15:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, so I will test that on main wiki, maybe i find out it's subwiki-based issue  \n15:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, it's indicated as valid  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0extensions.xwiki.org is a subwiki too  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway best is to create a jira issue and will check that ASAP  \n15:46\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, just validating that on main wiki on rc1, if it works and it's not working on milestone-1 then I will check latest snapshot (i believe it's build nightly) to check that also  \n15:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0Ok, it works on main wiki on RC-1, I will try the same on milestone-1  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0stupid bot!  \n15:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe there is a way for the bot to get the list of existing projects ids on jira and don't even try if it does not match  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could even teach our bot to learn how to play go :)  \n15:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, we could  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we could write rc-1 in lowercase \u2026 but its nice to be able to scorn the bot from time to time too!  \n15:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:57\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0okay, so if it's on main wiki, the query works without any issues... It might be due to the fact it doesn't find any extension on main wiki, hence failing (will try now)  \n15:57\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:02\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0Ok, so it just silently fails on subwiki... I will create issue on Jira tomorrow morning  \n16:03\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n16:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok thanks  \n16:07\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0You're very welcome :)  \n16:07\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0I'm the one who should be thanking :)  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems the bot has some issues  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've installed an extension on xwiki.org and I got:  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Failed to send event [com.xpn.xwiki.internal.event.XARImportedEvent@177] to listener [org.xwiki.ircbot.internal.XARImportEventListener@4e2d3d7f]  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the job logs  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0will need to debug but if someone has an idea...  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should have the exception in the log  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahyes just realized I could click  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0class java.lang.NullPointerException: null  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking code  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems EC is null  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0strange  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I guess I'll need to change the code to use a provider  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't really have any EC provider  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we must have changed something  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I don't remember seeing this before  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is the complete stack trace ?  \n16:17\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13191  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW I didn't realize that installinng a XAR on farm would install the pages on all subwikis ;)  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0makes sense though. Does it mean that removing or upgrading the extension will do that on all subwikis too?  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's nice)  \n16:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0updated http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/Migration+Guide+To+Nested+Pages  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it also mean that when you crate a new wiki the extension is automatically installed on it  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah nice  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and powerful  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well, it may sounds like in theory but I think it's not really what you want most of the time for XARs  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/like/nice/  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's logical at least  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but indeed maybe an option to install in all existing wikis would be nice too or warn about this  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and about the fact that wiki pages will be installed in all subwikis)  \n16:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok seems the bot is not working anymore, page changes are not sent to the channel  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0restarting it  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm it doesn't want to be killed :)  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was thinking it could be the old xwik instance  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but i stopped the irc bot there normally  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I stopped the scheduler and stopped the bot  \n17:02\u00a0<mrvis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<avisser>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<EEG>\u00a0Hi! yesterday I asked a question about IE and got a response. It suggested to go to a web page describing problems with IE. But it seems for me it is not exactly about the problem I have. And I have no idea what to do with the .patch file place there.  \n17:36\u00a0<EEG>\u00a0Sorry, can I ask my question again?  \n17:37\u00a0<EEG>\u00a0I have a problem with diagrams created with the Diagram Application. I can see diagrams in Chrome browser, but IE 11 shows the source XML text. What should I do to make diagrams visible in IE?  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it svg?  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(EEG)  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you paste the xml you have on pastebin for examepl?  \n17:38\u00a0<EEG>\u00a0I am not a xwiki guru and don't have access to the XWIKI server.
