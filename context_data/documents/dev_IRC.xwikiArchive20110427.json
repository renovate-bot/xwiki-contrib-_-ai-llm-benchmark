They are looking at the code and trying to understand that and all the sudden they have build issues. If they don't know maven then they are likely to give up.  \n10:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0They're thinking about a feature they want and they see in the code what needs changing and build problems will derail their whole train of thought.  \n10:01\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but the possible solution are way too painful for us writing the pom files as far as i can see for now  \n10:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and i doubt we are the only one having this issue anyway it's probably the same for pretty mush all maven based big projects  \n10:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0what's the worst part about adding repos everywhere? They don't ever have to change.  \n10:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0They do  \n10:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/mush/much/  \n10:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Rarely  \n10:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0rarely enough that sed is not an option?  \n10:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0err \\*often  \n10:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We could try  \n10:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If vmassol OKs it  \n10:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Wha't happening with the release? jvelociter was supposed to be the release manager  \n10:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0having relative paths with repo in root pom of each git repository is probably cleaner  \n10:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0less stuff in pom file and you don't have changes issues like repository changing  \n10:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0plus it make possible to build without network a submodule  \n10:07\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(if you already have all the needed dependencies in you local repo obviously)  \n10:08\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:08\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0there was a project ajax based form creation on xwiki  \n10:08\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n10:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi redflame  \n10:09\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0hi  \n10:09\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0can I ask something about that project/  \n10:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sure  \n10:11\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0from the database point of view,there is need of key -value database.there can be tables like form ,questions,response etc.is it correct?  \n10:11\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0for that idea  \n10:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Not quite  \n10:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The form uses the XWiki data model behind  \n10:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Which already offers abstract data structures like classes and objects  \n10:12\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0but that classes would ultimately build tables in database.  \n10:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So the outcome of the wizard would be an XWiki Class, a sheet for displaying instances, and an index page  \n10:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, but that's not a concern  \n10:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That's handled automatically  \n10:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0All you have to do is create the classes  \n10:13\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0\u00a0If I wants to do in php without using xwiki then?  \n10:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Then yes, you'd have to define your own mappings  \n10:15\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0if I say,for each response I would create a different table.can it fast query if I want to fetch saved responses.  \n10:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n10:15\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0or it is a bad idea from database point of view  \n10:15\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0because it would create so many tables  \n10:17\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0are you getting what I am asking?  \n10:17\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n10:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, it depends on how you model your database  \n10:19\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:19\u00a0<xipe>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In XWiki, all data structures are mapped to the same set of tables  \n10:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/DatabaseSchema  \n10:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0xwikidoc->xwikiobjects->xwikiproperties->(xwikistrings, xwikifloats, xwikidates...)  \n10:28\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0if you won't have xwiki then how would you proceed?  \n10:28\u00a0<redflame>\u00a0means in basic database terms  \n10:41\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: Hi, just get your message from yesterday, nice to see they have agreed  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, but they haven't sent the license yet....  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0hello.  \n10:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a02011-04-27 11:48:33,685 [main] WARN \u00a0tion.ComponentAnnotationLoader \u00a0- Component [org.xwiki.annotation.internal.content.SpaceNormalizerContentAlterer] is being overwritten by component [org.xwiki.annotation.internal.content.SpaceNormalizerContentAlterer] for Role/Hint [role = [org.xwiki.annotation.content.ContentAlterer] hint = [space-normalizer]].
