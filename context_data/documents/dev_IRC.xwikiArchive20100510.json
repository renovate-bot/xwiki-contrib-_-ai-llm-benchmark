Any objections to sending to the dev list?  \nvmassol - (14:32): CalebJamesDeLisl: can you explain again what you want to do ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:33): Check your email in the notifications list, I just invited it.  \nvmassol - (14:33): hmm\u2026. but notifications list is not about doing invitation or testing\u2026.  \nvmassol - (14:33): that' swhat I don't understand  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:34): Sergiu suggested I send it there rather than to dev or user (where I was originally going to send it.)  \nvmassol - (14:34): if you're testing it's not a good idea to use the lists  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:34): I have done plenty of testing already, I want to tell people about it.  \nvmassol - (14:34): then why don't you send an email?  \nvmassol - (14:35): (a normal email that is)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:35): Guess I'm a show off.  \nvmassol - (14:35): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:35): My main worry was that the list was going to eat the HTML, that's hard to test without sending to the list.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:38): If you want I can do it the boring way with \"proven technology\" :)  \nvmassol - (14:38): the pb is that you're sending soemthing without context  \nvmassol - (14:39): btw it didn't work for me  \nvmassol - (14:39): (I don't know what it was supposed to do)  \nvmassol - (14:39): (but since nothing happens I guess it doesn't work)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:39): What did you try to do?  \nvmassol - (14:39): I clicked on accept  \nvmassol - (14:39): then it asked me to log in  \nvmassol - (14:39): once I was logged in it asked me to register  \nvmassol - (14:39): I closed my broweser tab  \nvmassol - (14:39): then I clicked again on accept  \nvmassol - (14:40): and it said the invitation is only valid once  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:40): That's because allowing the message to be accepted would let the world into the incubator.  \nvmassol - (14:40): why would I want to join incubator.myxwiki.org?  \nvmassol - (14:40): I already have access there  \nvmassol - (14:40): and why would I need to register again there  \nvmassol - (14:40): since I already have an account  \nvmassol - (14:40): and just logged in  \nvmassol - (14:41): one comment: the UI for the mail has to be worked on  \nvmassol - (14:41): the buttons are not visible  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:42): Colors too light?  \nvmassol - (14:42): no placement, styling, size,  \nvmassol - (14:42): but caty could help for this  \nvmassol - (14:42): no hurry  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:43): Hmm, They are colored, sized and placed on my email client...  \nvmassol - (14:43): there are 20 lines of text or so  \nvmassol - (14:43): and one of them happen to be buttons  \nvmassol - (14:44): but that's a detail  \nvmassol - (14:44): compared to the feature  \nvmassol - (14:44): I wasn't able to make it work I think  \nvmassol - (14:44): or I don't understand it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:44): Which feature?  \nvmassol - (14:45): I don't know  \nvmassol - (14:45): I guess I was expecting to get access to some space  \nvmassol - (14:45): but I don't know, that's the pb of the mail  \nvmassol - (14:45): I don't underatdn what it's about  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:45): Not yet, it's for allowing people to join an open wiki.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:46): (those who didn't know about it.)  \nvmassol - (14:46): ok then it doesn't work for people who already have access  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:46): No permissions are conferred in the message as of yet.  \nvmassol - (14:46): again here's what I did:  \nvmassol - (14:46): - clicked accept  \nvmassol - (14:46): - I was asked to log in!!!  \nvmassol - (14:47): (how could I do that if I'm not already a member of the wiki ?)  \nvmassol - (14:47): - then I asked to register  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:47): Closed wiki breaks everything because you can't view the register page.  \nvmassol - (14:47): then why did you send an invitation for?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:47): To show that it can be done ;)  \nvmassol - (14:47): you should have said in the content that it was a test not meant to work maybe?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:48): I thought I did, itn't there a few paragraphs of content?  \nvmassol - (14:48): yes there is but it's a lot of text and I couldn't really understand it after I read it twice :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:48): Hang on, pasting a screen shot with the buttons...  \nvmassol - (14:48): anyway  \nvmassol - (14:49): IMO you need to set up functional tests for your feature  \nvmassol - (14:50): we already have a setup for sending/receiving emails as part of functional tests  \nvmassol - (14:50): (the fwk we're using is called greenmail AFAIR)  \nvmassol - (14:50): (there should be some example in distribution-tests somewhere)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:51): Yes, I have been thinking about how to test.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:51): http://tinycoke.com/image/6rrxsnTDibzw.png  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:52): screen shot from my email client.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:52): make sure we're talking about the same thing.  \nsdumitriu - (14:52): \"This invitation has already been accepted and the offer is no longer \u00a0valid.\"  \nvmassol - (14:52): and mine: http://tinycoke.com/\\_6r96PlfEyM6/screen\\_shot\\_2010-05-10\\_at\\_2.51.50\\_pm.png  \nvmassol - (14:52): yes the buttons in both images are not visible enough  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:53): Ok, gmail apparently breaks html messages.  \nvmassol - (14:53): I don't tink it's gmail  \nvmassol - (14:53): it was the same in my desktop mail client  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:54): Hmm, my luck to write an email which is only thunderbird compatible :/  \nvmassol - (14:54): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:55): I think the use of <style> is the problem, I noticed other html emails in notifications were using <div style=  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:55): Anyway that's the template.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:56): Todo: allow non-html emails  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:56): improve the template  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:56): invitations carrying permissions (dangerous)  \nEnygma` left at 14:56 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:56): Invitations which time out rather than being one time use.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:57): Ok so regular mail it is ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:57): vmassol: Do you have an opinion on whether global users of myxwiki.org should be allowed to send mail?  \nvmassol - (14:58): CalebJamesDeLisl: for an ex of using greenmail: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/trunk/distribution-test/selenium-tests/src/test/it/com/xpn/xwiki/it/selenium/WatchListTest.java  \nvmassol - (14:58): CalebJamesDeLisl: you're talking about the mail sender plugin?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:58): Talking about whether the invitation app should be open to them.  \nvmassol - (14:59): there's a jira opened for it so that only admins are allowed to use it  \nvmassol - (14:59): (or something like that)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:59): mailsender enjoys \"security through obscurity\" because it's hard to use ;)  \nvmassol - (15:00): XPMAIL-7  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:00): A solution to xpmail-7 is to put a password on the mail relay and keep the word hidden.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:01): Users must have view on xwikipreferences but they need not have view on the invitation config page.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:01): s/solution/workaround/  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 15:02  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:02): So any opinion on whether the invitation app should allow global myxwiki users to send?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:03): I can check the logs from time to time and make sure it's not being abused.  \nvmassol - (15:04): -1 from me (for myxwiki.org)  \nvmassol - (15:05): I'd be ok for admins though I think  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:05): Admins of all subwikis?  \njvdrean left at 15:05 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (15:05): admin of a subwiki  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:05): Not sure how to set that permission...  \nvmassol - (15:05): just check admin rights  \nvmassol - (15:06): set?  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 15:06  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:07): I see, I was protecting it using permission objects, it also has a function for preventing users from sending.  \nvmassol - (15:08): anyway the default rights for the invitation manager should be discussed on the list probably  \nflorinciu left at 15:08 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmassol - (15:08): you could send a proposal maybe  \nvmassol - (15:08): btw not sure you saw the link I gave you above re functional tests, pasting it again:  \nvmassol - (15:08): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/trunk/distribution-test/selenium-tests/src/test/it/com/xpn/xwiki/it/selenium/WatchListTest.java  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:09): Default for the myxwiki example version?
