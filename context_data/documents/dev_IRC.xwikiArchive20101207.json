Normal Users | \u00a0developers ?  \ntmortagne - (19:36): evalica: that will be used by administrator first, basic users don't have the right to install extensions anyway  \nevalica - (19:36): I'm asking because I don't know if I should think about a simple/advanced version ... should I make this separation?  \nevalica - (19:37): because we have a lot of extensions that come from core.. and that the users may not use them at all  \nevalica - (19:37): q: you can uninstall an extension if it a core one ? .. or we can just uninstall just the installed ones?  \ntmortagne - (19:38): evalica: for now upgrading/uninstalling core extension is too conplex because most of the time XWiki does not have write access on theses  \ntmortagne - (19:38): which is what a difference is made between core extension and installed extensions  \nevalica - (19:39): so .. should they be listed in a normal manner? or can I hide them? :) under some advanced thing  \ntmortagne - (19:39): but don't mix core extension and extension that are in svn platform/core/ folder  \nevalica - (19:39): also, you made this tutorial http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/ExtensionModule#HQuicktutorial  \ntmortagne - (19:39): in extension manager \"core extension\" means extension found in the application located in tomcat  \ntmortagne - (19:40): evalica: yes core extension are pretty advanced things  \nevalica - (19:40): but you didn't specify where I get the identifier.. and where I place the jar ... and is it a jar? because in the Design you talk about xar, maven, etc ... and repositories  \ntmortagne - (19:40): the current UI should be seen more as a demo UI than a real UI  \ntmortagne - (19:41): evalica: i did not made this tutorial  \nevalica - (19:41): the think is that I don't know the limits of the desired UI proposal ... should I add repositories ... do we already have xar support?  \ntmortagne - (19:41): it has been done by Sorin  \ntmortagne - (19:42): evalica: the question is not really what we already have, currently we don't have much  \ntmortagne - (19:42): the point is what do we want  \ntmortagne - (19:42): don('t look at the tutorial  \ntmortagne - (19:42): http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/ExtensionModule#HPlanning is better for you need  \nevalica - (19:42): the thing is that I don't know how to use what we have :) ... yet to know what we want to have  \nevalica - (19:43): is this http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/ApplicationManagerApplication related to Extension Manager? is the same thing?  \ntmortagne - (19:43): no  \ntmortagne - (19:43): it's not covering the same thing at all and forget all about http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/ApplicationManagerApplication it's deprecated and bad design  \nevalica - (19:44): \"download extension from remote repositories to a local repository \" what this step suppose to do?  \nevalica - (19:44): should this be done from the UI? or locally?  \ntmortagne - (19:44): by target when i think about extension manager is apt-get on debian/ubuntu so a good model is the application manager you have on ubuntu  \ntmortagne - (19:44): s/by/my/  \nevalica - (19:46): tmortagne: I use win :|  \nevalica - (19:46): :)  \ntmortagne - (19:46): when you want to install something on most linux system you get a list of available applications on remote repositories and when you ask to install it the tool is downloading and installing it as well and any dependencies  \ntmortagne - (19:46): evalica: sure but you could try an ubuntu live cd for example  \ntmortagne - (19:46): there is nothing similar in windows word or even on mac  \ntmortagne - (19:46): s/word/world/  \nevalica - (19:47): so .. there should be a place where you could specify the repository .. and populate the list after  \ntmortagne - (19:47): yes  \ntmortagne - (19:47): here is some key features:  \ntmortagne - (19:47): - provide a list of repositories which contains a bunch of extensions  \ntmortagne - (19:48): - show in the UI the extension found on theses repository  \ntmortagne - (19:48): - for each of them the admin can ask to install it and the tool will take care of installing any dependency as well  \nevalica - (19:48): can you give me an example of repository? is an URL?  \ntmortagne - (19:49): one example already supported by extension manager is a maven repository  \ntmortagne - (19:49): but that's not really important to design the UI  \nevalica - (19:49): and where you specify it?  \nevalica - (19:49): in a cfg file?  \ntmortagne - (19:49): all you have to know is that you have to show a list of extensions  \ntmortagne - (19:50): evalica: currently it's in xwiki.properties but there should be a UI for it  \nevalica - (19:50): the thing is that I see two steps: extensions that are in the current wiki and adding/evolving new extensions (here is the repo step)  \ntmortagne - (19:51): basically a repository is:  \ntmortagne - (19:51): - en URL  \ntmortagne - (19:51): - a type to indicate to extension manger what kind of repository is it  \nevalica - (19:51): if is not in a repo ... you could attach the jar? directly from UI?  \nevalica - (19:51): by type you mean: local | remote ( war, jar, maven ) ?  \ntmortagne - (19:52): it's should not be an attachment no, you should be able to upload an extension yes but it will be stored with the other in the local repository  \ntmortagne - (19:52): evalica: no i mean \"maven\" an any other kind of repository  \ntmortagne - (19:53): there is a lot of repository systems  \nevalica - (19:53): do we currently have a way to pack an extension? I mean ... like give it a name, icon, etc .. or is just a simple manual export step?  \ntmortagne - (19:54): not really for an extension you would have on your hard drive but theses information are in the repositories yes  \ntmortagne - (19:54): for each extension you can have pretty much associated information  \ntmortagne - (19:54): id, author, license, website  \ntmortagne - (19:54): etc.  \ntmortagne - (19:55): but IMO priority is extension you install from a repository  \ntmortagne - (19:55): that's the real useful feature  \nevalica - (19:56): and again do we have such a repo now?  \ntmortagne - (19:56): evalica: and again currently we support maven repository :)  \nevalica - (19:56): I mean ... code.xwiki.org ... is a site ... it could be a repo ...  \nevalica - (19:56): tmortagne: I don't know mucha bout maven :P  \ntmortagne - (19:56): yes it could  \ntmortagne - (19:56): anything could  \nevalica - (19:57): so it's a pom .. file ... on xwiki.org space?  \nevalica - (19:57): k . so it's an URL :) ... k  \ntmortagne - (19:57): in a maven repository you have the extension file (jar, war, etc.) and a descriptor (pom.xml)  \nevalica - (19:57): don't you have a link for our maven repo?  \ntmortagne - (19:57): and the pom.xml can contains pretty much anything  \ntmortagne - (19:58): evalica: http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/ but again that not really important what the repository itself looks like behind the scene  \nevalica - (19:58): it's important.. if I want to understand some of these things  \ntmortagne - (19:59): all you have to know is that whatever the kind of repository you get from it a list of extensions and metadas for each of them\u00f9  \ntmortagne - (19:59): that's what you need to show in the UI, how the repository technically is is internal details  \ntmortagne - (20:00): evalica: get a ubuntu live cd and look at the UI you will understand what is it a lot better than any explanation i could give you  \nevalica - (20:01): tmortagne: k - thank you for all the explanations :) still there are blurry things... but is much better  \ntmortagne - (20:01): evalica: sure that's a very big subject  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 20:03  \ntmortagne - (20:05): evalica: the most complex thing for the UI i think is how to give to the user the choice of installing an extension on the whole farm or only some listed wikis  \nevalica - (20:06): the problem is that I don't know how to display these extensions : because they are very complex  \nevalica - (20:06): you could have jar, war, xar ...  \ntmortagne - (20:06): yep  \nevalica - (20:06): I read somewhere that you want to support  \nevalica - (20:06): pages and their objects: macros, ssx, stc  \nevalica - (20:07): and to listen if there are changes to those pages...  \ntmortagne - (20:07): not exactly  \ntmortagne - (20:07): you can upgrade any extension  \nevalica - (20:07): so is not about .... a list of metadatas.. is about .. items that have different structures  \ntmortagne - (20:07): so when you upgrade a xar extension manager is checking if the user modified the standard page to upgrade etx.  \ntmortagne - (20:08): evalica: i'm not sure  \ntmortagne - (20:08): i think there is a commun UI to start installing an extension  \nevalica - (20:08): yep ... but I guess.. the extension manager will not limit to that  \ntmortagne - (20:08): then for each kind of extension you can have question/answer sent by each handler  \nevalica - (20:09): so in order to thing about something extensible.. I need to have at least a view about what could be further developed  \ntmortagne - (20:10): evalica: i have to go now and i'm not explaining very well behing in a rush, we can talk about that tomorrow when you tested Ubuntu UI on a live cd or one of the dev computer which is probably the easiest  \ntmortagne - (20:11): you can ask Marius for example ;)  \nevalica - (20:11): tmortagne: thanks again  \nmbryant left at 20:11 (Quit: KVIrc 4.0.2 Insomnia http://www.kvirc.net/  \ntmortagne - (20:27): evalica: i forgot, you can also think about android market you have on you phone except that you have only one repository and all applications are independents  \nevalica - (20:31): tmortagne: \u00a0thanks ... i will research a bit  \nlucaa left at 20:45 (Ping timeout: 250 seconds  \nevalica - (20:47): tmortagne: by the way the tutorial doesn't work on Win.
