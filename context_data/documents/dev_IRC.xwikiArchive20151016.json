 \n14:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I am not sure what this might break ...  \n14:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I had a look and it seems to be a good solution  \n14:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0... but if yiou aere not sure either, I am willing to take the blame and do the change ;)  \n14:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you are already at it ... well, I have no XWiki dev instance running atm  \n14:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok then, I`ll do it  \n14:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, thanks!  \n14:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ve also noticed another issue with the Mocca calendar app, that is when creating a calendar in a non-terminal page (something.WebHome) and then creating an event in this new calendar, the new event gets created in the space \"something\\.WebHome.eventName\"  \n14:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0instead of something.WebHome.eventName  \n14:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0classic getSpace issue related to NestedSpaces  \n14:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ll report it  \n15:20\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/MOCCACAL-82  \n15:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0\u00a0Enygma`: uh, oh, thanks for finding this  \n15:58\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: don't know if you saw the new extension I added, I tough about putting it in the main application but I did not wanted to add a PR constraint on it  \n16:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have seen it, just been pressed about other things  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure wanted to indicate why it's a separated extension  \n16:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0MoccaCal still requires PR anyway, due to the one or other mistake  \n16:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there is still MOCCACAL-54 \u00a0for example .... but anyway, in case that gets resolved, maybe it is better to have the iCal stuff in a separate module  \n16:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I also see the current calendar listing livetable could need a hook for the iCal ... have not thought hard enough to find a solution for this, though  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: would be clear than what I did yes but it's working well for now  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*cleaner  \n16:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0as soon as I have an idea how to allow a hook there I will go for it ... first trying to understand/fix MOCCACAL-82 though  \n16:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:27\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed if there was a conflict you could have dropped it\u2026 since I'm pretty sure we won't release a 7.2.1  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry\u2026 (Enygma`)  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw we should release 7.1.3  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see who's next on the roster  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah it's thomas, lucky him  \n17:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the \"Scripting Documentation Application\" is not working on my local 7.2-jetty-hsql instance. is this just me, or is this reproducible?

Sorry. :(  \n17:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Ah, but you can check in the wiki admin -> extension manager -> extension updater  \n17:48\u00a0<Ramona>\u00a0has quit  \n17:48\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Can I just install the extension \"XWiki Enterprise Flavor - Main Wiki \"? Can it harm the current wiki?  \n17:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0should allow to upgrade the UI there too, because tecnically the UI is just another extension  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea or tmortagne may know some tricks  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes indeed ClemensR is correct  \n17:49\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Extension updater tells that all extensions are up to date.  \n17:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0main wiki UI is not soo good for subwikis, I am not sure if this breaks things  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it will  \n17:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0duh, then ... one moment ....  \n17:51\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0The \"XWiki Enterprise Flavor - Sub Wiki\" is also available for install. Should I do that?  \n17:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0... sounds better. hang on, I try to check something ...  \n17:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4: do you have anything listed in the \"Installed Extensions\" section?  \n17:52\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Actually I have only one wiki. Does it simplify the situation?  \n17:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you are administering a subwiki in a farm of wikis? or is this just the main wiki ?  \n17:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if the \"XWiki Enterprise Flavor - Sub Wiki\" is already installed, then you have a subwiki to \u00a0manage  \n17:53\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0@mflorea \"There are no extensions installed.\"  \n17:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0then it means that the extension index has been deleted somehow  \n17:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0probably because the permanent directory has not been set correctly and it defaulted to a temp folder inside the servlet container  \n17:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and that temp folder has been deleted  \n17:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0best is to find a way to restart the wiki and to use the Distribution Wizard to repair the UI (and thus extension index)  \n17:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0this is a job for the server admin, definitely. if the wiki itself is fine then there is nothing to do for the local wiki admin for the moment  \n17:55\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0For the XWiki extensions (Main and Sub) the \"Install\" button is available. I believe they are not installed yet. Can I install them and it upgrades my Wiki?  \n17:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0they are not marked as installed, but you have the wiki pages, otherwise you wouldn't have access to the administration  \n17:57\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Yes, It looks they are not installed. Can I install them?  \n17:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0reinstalling them might ... just lead to odd conflicts. your server admin should try to recover the \"permanent directory\". unless that is fixed, you will have to deal with the situation again and again  \n17:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is just the marker in the \"permanent dir\" that has been lost; the actual pages are installed, no need to install them again  \n17:58\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0OK. I am going to ask our system admin to restart the XWiki server. Is that the solution?  \n17:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ask your system admin to read the documentation first ;) ... one moment  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0first thing to do is check what permanent dir has been configured and fix it because given the issue it probably not been configured at all  \n18:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the best would be to found where the initial permanent dir went but it probably been deleted as a temp dir  \n18:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0once the perm dir is probably configured then you should do what mflorea and restart to get a repair UI that will register again the XE flavor  \n18:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n18:01\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Fine. I believe I am charged with the solution.
