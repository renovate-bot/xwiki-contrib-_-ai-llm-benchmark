I have considered using XWiki, as it gives me something else. For everyday use, on a personal level and working, would you recommend I go from moinmoin to XWiki? Worth the change?  \n15:28\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0jvipa5g: I have myself moved from moinmoin to XWiki, and thought it was worth it.  \n15:28\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0I also have a tool for packaging the contents of a moinmoin-wiki as a xar-file for import to XWiki.  \n15:29\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0I'm not sure if it works any longer, though.  \n15:38\u00a0<jvipa5g>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: But are you happy with the change?  \n15:42\u00a0<jvipa5g>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: When backing up or upgrading is simple?  \n15:43\u00a0<jvipa5g>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: And where I can get the import tool?  \n15:49\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0Yes, I'm happy with the change.  \n15:50\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0I converted my wiki three years ago and the converter tool has been unmaintained since. \u00a0But I can put it on github if you are prepared to work with it.  \n15:51\u00a0<jvipa5g>\u00a0AndreasJonsson:I found in version 3.x XWiki, that when a long text pasted into a new wiki page, it gave errors. Do not know if will continue failing.  \n15:52\u00a0<jvipa5g>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: if I download shows as I can prove it on github to convert my wiki.  \n15:56\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:04\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0jvipa5g: Which text were you pasting? \u00a0Did you paste it in WYSIWYG mode? \u00a0Have you reported the problem at jira.xwiki.org?  \n16:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:27\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:28\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:43\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:48\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:15\u00a0<jvipa5g>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: was in WYSIWYG mode, but a while. if producri I will report back. What is the limit of text in a wiki page with XWiki?  \n17:27\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0The page contents is stored as 'longtext' in MySQL. \u00a0I guess the limit is decided by how you configure 'max\\_allowed\\_packet' in MySQL.  \n17:39\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n19:01\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:09\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:03\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n20:31\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:39\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:06\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n22:08\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:51\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:17\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
