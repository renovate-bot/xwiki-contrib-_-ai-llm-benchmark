There may be cases where object inheritance is not needed (an overkill) and other cases where it may be very useful.  \n15:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0with any broad deprecation we have to consider edge cases and give the programmer leaway  \n15:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0for example (new Array(30).join(' ')) is really the best way to get 30 spaces  \n15:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and new WebSocket() is required to get a websocket  \n15:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but in general, code using: new, prototype, constructor and this \u00a0is much more likely to have bugs (imo) than code which avoids it  \n15:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*them  \n15:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0why xwiki-platform-5.4.x still not work?
