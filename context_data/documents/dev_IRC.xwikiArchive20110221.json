If the office server fails to start only when you use it as a service then I guess it something wrong with your setup, but I haven't used oo as a service so I can't tell what's the proper configuration.  \n08:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i see  \n08:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, still thank you!  \n08:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0np, try to review the steps you did for making oo a service  \n08:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, i actually am trying to make OOo get started by xwiki  \n08:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but it fails immediatly...  \n08:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but it works when you don't setup oo as a service, i.e. when you let xwiki start oo  \n08:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0no, the problem is it doesn't work either way for me  \n08:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and then it crashes  \n08:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i want xwiki to start it but that makes the soffice.bin process appear for a few secs  \n08:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0are you sure? because the command line tool worked, i.e. it managed to start the server  \n08:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0if i try to setup oo as a service the service won't start  \n08:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:54\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i am sure, like i said, it's only there for a second  \n08:54\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that's what i don't understand  \n08:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jstoldt: so you have \"Server type: Internally managed (local)\" right?
