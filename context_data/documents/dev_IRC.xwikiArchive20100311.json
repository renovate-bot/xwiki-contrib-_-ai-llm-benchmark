Cependant, IE6 est sorti le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001 et bien qu'il sera encore support\u00e9 par Microsoft jusqu'au 21 avril 2013 (ce qui est un record pour un tel produit), il faut remarquer que depuis ce 1/3/2010 (http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/01/modern-browsers-for-modern-applications.html), m\u00eame le g\u00e9ant Google ne le supporte plus pour ses applications en ligne. En outre, deux nouvelles version de IE ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9  \nDenis - (10:03): Les statistiques d'utilisation des navigateurs (cfr. http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers\\_stats.asp) montre aujourd'hui que l'utilisation d'IE6 repr\u00e9sente moins de 10% du march\u00e9 (13% actuellement des visites sur votre site ces 3 derniers mois), et que dans moins d'un an nous pouvons penser qu'il sera compl\u00e8tement disparu, par manque de support des site internet de nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration.  \nDenis - (10:03): Nous portons donc tout nos efforts sur le support dIE7 et IE8, ainsi que sur les navigateurs FireFox 3.x et Safari 4.x. Il nous est d\u00e8s lors aujourd'hui particuli\u00e8rement difficile de justifier encore du support d'IE6. Nous vous conseillons de recommander \u00e0 vos utilisateurs de r\u00e9aliser la mise \u00e0 jour de leur navigateur, car outre une am\u00e9lioration de votre site, il profiterons \u00e9galement mieux de l'Internet actuel.  \nDenis - (10:03): Enfin, nous sommes \u00e9videment conscient que certain d'entre eux pourrait garder un ancien navigateur pour support\u00e9 des outils d'aide aux handicap\u00e9 (en particulier les mal voyant), mais il nous semble assez peu probable dans ce cas que les d\u00e9fauts visuels rapport\u00e9s soit r\u00e9ellement significatif.  \nDenis - (10:03): Si malgr\u00e9 cela, vous souhaitiez que nous portions \u00e0 nouveau une attention plus pouss\u00e9 sur IE6, nous serions contraint de vous \u00e9tablir un devis pour la r\u00e9alisation de cette am\u00e9lioration difficilement amortissable sur d'autre clients.  \nDenis - (10:03): Bien cordialement,  \nDenis - (10:03): Denis  \nvmassol - (10:04): interesting :)  \nDenis - (10:04): oups  \nDenis - (10:04): bas window  \nDenis - (10:04): bad sorry  \nvmassol - (10:04): we could reuse that too!  \nDenis - (10:05): for sure, that is a pity to see client complaining on IE6 support  \nDenis - (10:05): nearly 10 years after the release !  \nDenis - (10:06): by the way, I am puzzle by an issue in XWikiDocument, could you help understand this ?  \nDenis - (10:06): public String getTranslatedContent(String language, XWikiContext context) throws XWikiException  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0XWikiDocument tdoc = getTranslatedDocument(language, context);  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0String rev = (String) context.get(\"rev\");  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if ((rev == null) || (rev.length() == 0)) {  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return tdoc.getContent();  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0XWikiDocument cdoc = context.getWiki().getDocument(tdoc, rev, context);  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return cdoc.getContent();  \nDenis - (10:06): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}  \nDenis - (10:07): why do we get rev from context here ?  \nvmassol - (10:07): right now I'm the one who needs help re relative refs\u2026. it's hard\u2026 :)  \nDenis - (10:07): :)  \nglerouge joined #xwiki at 10:11  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 10:14  \nplunden - (10:14): Hi, is python indentation supposed to work in xwiki scripting?

(16:14): yes, I understand your point, and, as I said, it's a good think you have reported the issue. It's just that I don't see how we can fix it.  \nDenis - (16:14): {{velocity}}  \nDenis - (16:14): (% style='break-after: page;' %)  \nDenis - (16:14): {{/velocity}}  \nmflorea - (16:15): :) yes, you protected it with a macro  \nmflorea - (16:15): but why not using a class?  \nDenis - (16:15): just because I need to fix the pdf exporter first :\u00e0  \nmflorea - (16:16): I don't see the relation  \nDenis - (16:16): there were issue under 1.9 that made css not functionning, there is I think an open issue in the 2.2, so I had to check again  \nsdumitriu - (16:16): Right, classnames are not kept  \nsdumitriu - (16:16): I should apply that patch for 2.2.3  \nmflorea - (16:17): ah, I see  \nmflorea - (16:17): so currently you have to put the style inline  \nDenis - (16:17): yes, it is needed  \nDenis - (16:18): and we would like our user to be able to use WYSIWYG to avoid the ugliness of the source  \nDenis - (16:18): they do not have to change style, but depending on their browser they loose part of it  \nsdumitriu - (16:18): Denis: would upgrading to 2.2.3 be an option for you?  \nmflorea - (16:19): but if using class names would work then your problem would be solved, right?  \nDenis - (16:20): I had to check that, since the process of preparing PDF is really tricky and never worked the way it should  \nDenis - (16:20): we will be migrating site to 2.2.x as soon as I feel it stable enough  \nDenis - (16:20): and surely I will try classes for styling  \nDenis - (16:22): even, if I get workaround, the way IE extends some styling will surely be annoying, maybe something coud be done their, no ?  \nmflorea - (16:23): now, without using class names, I don't see how can we fix this problem. When the editor gets access to the DOM tree, the style attribute has already been changed..  \nDenis - (16:23): -their+there  \nmflorea - (16:23): in IE, the problem is the serialization of the DOm tree, which is also done by the browser  \nDenis - (16:24): probably, but concats of similar borders is possible, no ?  \nglerouge left at 16:24 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsdumitriu - (16:24): Denis: IIRC, IE is actually doing you a favor, since the version of css4j that we're using doesn't support shorthand properties like border  \nDenis - (16:24): not sure human agrees :)  \nmflorea - (16:24): :)  \nmflorea - (16:24): yes  \nDenis - (16:25): I had real end user on the other side :)  \nsdumitriu - (16:25): Actually I have a better solution: STOP USING IE!  \nsdumitriu - (16:25): :)  \nDenis - (16:25): had you missed my bad paste earlier this morning, about IE6 :)  \nsdumitriu - (16:25): No, that was good  \nDenis - (16:26): this is terrible how end user stay stucked on IE  \nDenis - (16:27): a major reason for pushing me migrating to 2.2, is that WYSIWYG does not work on IE in 1.9 !  \nmflorea - (16:27): Denis, let me locate the border problem, I want to be sure the border is \"duplicated\" when I get the innerHTML of the edited document and not in some other place  \nmflorea - (16:28): what IE are your end users using? IE6, 7 or 8?  \nDenis - (16:28): any, but I agree to leave IE6  \nDenis - (16:29): I do not check it myself anymore  \nDenis - (16:29): to old, and google do not supported anymore which was a great news  \nmflorea - (16:34): indeed, paragraph.outerHTML \"duplicates\" the border stlye in IE..  \nNirmal joined #xwiki at 16:37  \nDenis - (16:37): headache: When I start studying computer, Microsoft products was considered leading-edge, now I avoid them as much as I can !  \nNirmal - (16:38): headache: I need your help, regarding the installation  \nheadache - (16:38): Denis, my university has signed an agreement with Microsoft so students could download Microsoft development products  \nheadache - (16:38): a real trap  \nheadache - (16:38): only 4-5 professor use gnu/linux  \nheadache - (16:39): in my opinion is a shame...  \nsdumitriu - (16:39): headache: Yes, same things in Romania  \nheadache - (16:40): but we're lucky C# has not entered in university courses... but it's only a question of time  \nNirmal - (16:40): headache, I've installed maven too, but what XWiki module to download is the question  \nDenis - (16:40): headache: Marketing is what they do best, else the better would already happen  \nheadache - (16:40): Denis, no i believe that Apple is marketing Google is advertising so Microsoft and Gnu Project are software  \nheadache - (16:40): :D  \nheadache - (16:41): Nirmal, you need platform  \nNirmal - (16:41): headache, ok  \nDenis - (16:41): if Apple were marketing, M$ would not have the most part of the market  \nheadache - (16:41): Nirmal, what you are trying to do?
