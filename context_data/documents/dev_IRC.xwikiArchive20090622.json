this MockDocumentAccessBridge class ?  \nvmassol - (22/06/2009 19:58): a mock instance of DocumentAccessBridge yes  \nvmassol - (22/06/2009 19:59): it's dynamic  \nvmassol - (22/06/2009 19:59): it's not code generation  \nvmassol - (22/06/2009 19:59): s/code generation/static code generation/  \nvmassol - (22/06/2009 19:59): it's bytecode code generation at runtime  \nvmassol - (22/06/2009 19:59): (using dynamic proxies or bytecode generation)  \nanamarias - (22/06/2009 20:02): like here ? http://www.jmock.org/mocking-classes.html  \nsdumitriu - (22/06/2009 20:05): Here's an example: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-rendering/xwiki-rendering-macros/xwiki-rendering-macro-include/src/test/java/org/xwiki/rendering/internal/macro/IncludeMacroTest.java  \nanamarias - (22/06/2009 20:08): this is how it tells the mock what should return for each method : mockDocumentAccessBridge.expects(once()).method(\"isDocumentViewable\").will(returnValue(true));, no ?  \nsdumitriu - (22/06/2009 20:08): Yes  \nanamarias - (22/06/2009 20:09): ok  \nanamarias - (22/06/2009 20:10): something else, is a component only consists of the interface (service) and its implementation ? or can it have multiple (helper) classes ? are they considered part of the component as well ?  \ncristinas joined #xwiki at 20:11  \nsdumitriu - (22/06/2009 20:12): The component is just the interface  \nsdumitriu - (22/06/2009 20:12): The implementation can use as many classes as needed  \nanamarias - (22/06/2009 20:12): can it also implement as many interfaces as needed ?  \nanamarias - (22/06/2009 20:12): not just the comp interface and the Initializable one ?  \nsdumitriu - (22/06/2009 20:13): Yes  \nanamarias - (22/06/2009 20:14): ok, thanks a lot. i'm out of questions for now :p  \ncristinas - (22/06/2009 20:15): sdumitriu: hi!   \nsdumitriu - (22/06/2009 20:16): Hi cristinas  \ncristinas - (22/06/2009 20:18): i've solved the exception and now the xwiki syntax - xhtml converter works .. and i would like to commit but using git   \nsdumitriu - (22/06/2009 20:18): K  \nsdumitriu - (22/06/2009 20:18): Did you checkout already?
