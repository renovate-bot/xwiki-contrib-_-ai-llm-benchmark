 \nasyd - (18/12/2008 16:55): no my question was for a string, that I want to edit via a selct, it's working very good  \nasyd - (18/12/2008 16:56): but for this boolean property, when the user choose the value, there are \"---\" \"yes\" \"no\" but I didn't find how to avoid the --- value  \njvdrean - (18/12/2008 16:56): I think it will disappear if you put a default value  \njvdrean - (18/12/2008 16:57): (if so its worth a doc update :D )  \nasyd - (18/12/2008 16:57): yeah indeed  \nasyd - (18/12/2008 16:59): it's works fine, thanks  \ngwash - (18/12/2008 19:21): what the policy of adding new tutorials?
