What else do I need to do?  \n05:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0jbwiv\\_: The current color theme can also override the logo  \n05:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Check there  \n05:28\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok, I'm using the ruby color theme...maybe that's it. thanks  \n05:29\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: do you know where you go to edit color themes? I see reference online to a separate color theme space, but I don't seem to have that  \n05:40\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: that was it. thank you!  \n05:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n06:14\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0is there a way to pull rss feeds from XWiki blogs?  \n06:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n06:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The blog RSS is already exposed in the page  \n06:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Should be something like http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/Blog/GlobalBlogRss?xpage=plain  \n06:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And there are feeds for each category as well  \n06:19\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: awesome. thank you!  \n06:19\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0is it recommended to create a separate space for each blog you have?  \n06:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Depends on what you're trying to do  \n06:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Normally you should use just one  \n06:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And use categories to split posts  \n06:22\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: I'd like to give each business unit we have its own blog  \n06:22\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0really wish there were a print book on xwiki and xwiki best practices. it seems very powerful and flexible, but the flexibility can be daunting at times  \n06:24\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Then you should create different blogs  \n06:25\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Not sure if you know about /xwiki/bin/Blog/Management  \n06:25\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: now I'm not sure. I'm thinking maybe it'd be better to create a Company News space and then create a separate category for each biz unit  \n06:26\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The main blog (in the blog space) will aggregate all the other blogs anyway  \n06:27\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok, thanks. wonder if I should create a Blog space, then separate blogs within this space?  \n06:29\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0You can't do that  \n06:29\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok, so only one blog per space?  \n06:29\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0A blog assumes every post in its space  \n06:30\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok, thank you  \n06:43\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: how long have you used xwiki if you don't mind me asking? do you tend to hit a lot of errors? I've somehow been able to crash mine a number of times so far....  \n06:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I've been using it for more than 7 years  \n06:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0How exactly crash?  \n06:45\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: well, the latest: Exception: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError thrown from the UncaughtExceptionHandler in thread \"http://wiki-dev.timco.aero/xwiki/bin/Blog/GlobalBlogRss?xpage=plain\"  \n06:45\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0I have \"-Xmx2048m\" configured for the process  \n06:45\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0and I'm the only current user  \n06:46\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0so I'd be really surprised if I've pushed it beyond those limits  \n06:46\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0unless it needs more ram than this for typical use  \n06:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0What about permgen?  \n06:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0-XX:MaxPermSize=  \n06:48\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: I haven't specified that, so I assume the JVM default  \n06:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0That's not enough  \n06:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0-XX:MaxPermSize=192m  \n06:49\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: ah, ok, I'll try that  \n06:50\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0I missed that from the Perf page. So it also seems to say I shouldn't go beyond 1024 for heap? guess I should lower this?  \n06:50\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0or is that 1024 for all I wonder  \n06:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, I don't agree with that  \n06:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Personally I use even 4G without any problems  \n06:52\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok. but you think 196 is plenty for permsize? ultimately, I'll have close to 3400 users  \n06:52\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, should be enough  \n06:55\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: you've been very helpful. thank you. do you happen to do any xwiki consulting?  \n06:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Personally, no, I don't have the time  \n06:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I can answer questions from time to time  \n06:57\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Support lists some options  \n06:57\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok, thanks. Have a great evening/morning/whatever ;-)  \n06:58\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0You're welcome  \n07:15\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0sdumitriu: I see that the rss feed pulls all data from all blogs. Is there a way to only get rss data from one blog?  \n07:28\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0nm, think I have it  \n07:38\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n07:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n08:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:33\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n09:35\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:38\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n09:56\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n10:02\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:19\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:20\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n11:44\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:01\u00a0<npm\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:54\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:30\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:36\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:40\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:40\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n16:59\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:59\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0guys, I see how you can get a rss feed for the main blog, but how can I get one for a blog I created in a separate space as the main content for that space?  \n17:01\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0I tried adding the meta info as suggested here: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Blog+Application#HRSSFeedfortheBlog, but no link shows up  \n17:06\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0jbwiv\\_: /xwiki/bin/view/Blog/BlogRss?xpage=plain&blog=SomeSpace.WebHome should work  \n17:07\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Replace SomeSpace with the target blog space  \n17:10\u00a0<jbwiv\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:15\u00a0<jbwiv\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:57\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<jbwiv\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<npm\\_\\_>\u00a0is now known as <npm>  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:52\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:53\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:53\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n19:54\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:09\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:10\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:15\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0sburjan`: Are you sure \"xwikiorg-manualtestcases\" is the right name?
