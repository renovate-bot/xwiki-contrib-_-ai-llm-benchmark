As such it scales as well as Java scales.\n\n# Multi Tenancy\n\nXWiki supports the ability to run hundreds and even thousands of wikis on the same JVM (i.e. same webapp).\n\nSome examples:\n\n* [MyXWiki](http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome) currently hosts over 170 wikis on a single JVM\n* [XWiki SAS Cloud](http://network.xwiki.com) currently hosts 1000+ wikis (but on several JVMs)\n\nSee the tutorial on [how to configure multi-tenancy](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Virtualization) to learn more.\n\n# Clustering\n\nXWiki provides an easy way to setup clustered instances of XWiki based on network events distribution. Clustering allows for 2 use cases:\n\n* Load distribution on several JVMs\n* Failover since if a machine is down the other ones are still available\n\nSee [Clustering](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Clustering) for more details.\n\n\n"}
