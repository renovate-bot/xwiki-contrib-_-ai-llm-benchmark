Do you know why when you click on a skin image on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/Skins it gives a smaller image? Shouldn't it be the other way around? Should we remove the click instead?  \nsburjan - (10:27): the old version was a img link to the file  \nsburjan - (10:27): I mean.. the image is linked to the file.. it's a link  \nsburjan - (10:27): I can remove it if you want  \nvmassol - (10:28): does it mean the image displayed is stretched and not the original size?  \nvmassol - (10:28): checking  \nvmassol - (10:28): ah you have 2 images  \nvmassol - (10:28): which is good for high quality  \nvmassol - (10:29): but I'd use an larger image when you click on the skin image  \njvdrean1 joined #xwiki at 10:29  \nvmassol - (10:29): as otherwise I don't see the point  \nvmassol - (10:29): or yes you can remove the click and the small image  \nvmassol - (10:29): up to you  \nvmassol - (10:29): do for the best  \nvmassol - (10:29): :)  \nvmassol - (10:29): I think clicking and see a large image is nicer for users though  \nvmassol - (10:29): but your choice  \nsdumitriu - (10:30): The linked image is deprecated  \nsburjan - (10:30): yes  \nsburjan - (10:30): just updated  \nsburjan - (10:30): dunny, they seem pretty same to me .. i mean the diff when clicked and when not  \nvmassol - (10:30): and the naming with .png and .PNG is not optimal  \nvmassol - (10:31): they're not the same size  \nvmassol - (10:31): that's my point  \njvdrean left at 10:31 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nvmassol - (10:31): I mean  \nvmassol - (10:31): the one you click is \\*smaller\\*  \nvmassol - (10:31): whereas it should be \\*larger\\* to view more details  \nsdumitriu - (10:31): vmassol: Refresh  \nsdumitriu - (10:31): They used to be different images, but now should be the same  \nvmassol - (10:32): they're now the same  \nvmassol - (10:32): right?  \nsdumitriu - (10:32): Yes  \nsburjan - (10:32): yes  \nvmassol - (10:32): ok  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 10:32  \nsburjan - (10:32): I usually don;t create links from the images  \nsburjan - (10:32): but If you insist, I can do that  \nvmassol - (10:32): nope I don't  \nvmassol - (10:32): but at least remove the old files from teh attachment list  \nsburjan - (10:32): but IMO they are big enought, no need for zoom  \nsburjan - (10:32): oaky  \nsburjan - (10:33): I was keepingthem in case of backward compatib  \nvmassol - (10:33): I don't think that's needed but if you want to keep them  \nvmassol - (10:33): then please rename them to something meaningful  \nsdumitriu - (10:33): No, remove them  \nsdumitriu - (10:34): Attachments are kept in the history  \nsdumitriu - (10:34): So reverting to an older version of the document will show the old attachments  \nmflorea left at 10:34 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan - (10:35): okay.. removing  \nsburjan - (10:35): done  \nsburjan - (10:36): so from now on I should remove deprecated images ?  \nvmassol - (10:36): yes  \nsburjan - (10:37): stored  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 10:59  \nlucaa left at 11:14 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 11:16  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 11:43  \nxwikibot joined #xwiki at 11:44  \n\n"}
