I have a question. It seems that when I want to see the RSS feed from my watchlist on Chrome, I get a download window. Is this normal ? I don't get this in Firefox  \n11:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am prompted to save a file named WatchlistRSS with no extension.  \n11:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the URL is /xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/WatchListRss?xpage=plain&outputSyntax=plain  \n11:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0is this normal ?  \n11:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: does not sounds normal, there is probably a content type issue  \n11:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I remember that on Chrome I was getting a plain text page, because Chrome does not have any RSS reader integrated as Firefox. But getting a download prompt is odd.  \n11:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks, I will report it  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: do you have the same issue with blog rss or other XWiki rss pages ?  \n11:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: no. The Blog RSS and Dashboard RSS renders as plain text, no download window  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I get plain text on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebRss?xpage=plain&outputSyntax=plain using chrome and indeed it tried to download on /xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/WatchListRss?xpage=plain&outputSyntax=plain  \n11:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so this is ok. But watchlist RSS prompts me to download  \n11:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so it should be reported, right ?  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so at least there is something special about the watchlist  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: it should be the same behavior whatever is the right one  \n11:12\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n11:12\u00a0<philipp\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:12\u00a0<Michitux>\u00a0has quit  \n11:15\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:15\u00a0<Michitux>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<philipp\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<Michitux>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n11:21\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<Michitux>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:25\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<philipp\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<Michitux>\u00a0has quit  \n11:27\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<Michitux>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikibot: are you crazy?  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems xwiki.org has restarted  \n11:30\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n11:30\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n11:30\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:30\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<philipp\\_>\u00a0Hi, I am having a problem with the WYSIWYG editor.
