 \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm ok fair point ;)  \n14:40\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0or I guess we could make an api endpoint that accepts arbitrary text and renders it without saving a document  \n14:40\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0but then you'd be hammering the server pretty hard, this parses markdown whenever you stop typing for 500ms  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've implemented a POC of that btw:  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/angular-rendering  \n14:43\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0neat  \n14:43\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0we could probably use the vdom stuff I've been doing to improve performance a bit  \n14:44\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0it takes a diff and only redraws what it has to  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm diff is hard for syntax  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0syntax rendering I mean  \n14:44\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0it diffs a dom  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so you still render the whole thing  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but only redraw what's needed?  \n14:45\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0sort of, it exists in the browser, yea  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm thought it was the browser's job to do taht  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*that  \n14:45\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0but the redraws are the expensive part  \n14:45\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0it should be, but browsers don't really do it  \n14:45\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0if you do like a $('#target').html(newThing); it just destroys the whole content and redraws  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:46\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0the vdom lib I'm using finds the elements that change, and actually only changes their properties if that's the only difference  \n14:47\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0there are some bugs, but I found you can have a youtube video playing in an iframe, and patch the bigger section without the youtube video stopping  \n14:47\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0I think it's just an off by one error in the code, one extra element is always redrawn unnecessesarily  \n14:47\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0the next element after the one you changed  \n14:49\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0so it's mostly useful if you want to have live elements like videos or if you've bound to events on that item  \n14:49\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0may or may not be useful depending on the context  \n14:50\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0hmm, maybe angular already does something like that?  \n14:50\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0I've never used it  \n14:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n15:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re angular I don't know but I doubt it  \n17:29\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:31\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0vmassol: any idea why I would get a download prompt to download a file, \"W5Za+dCF.bin\" when I try to got to www.xwiki.com using Mozilla?
