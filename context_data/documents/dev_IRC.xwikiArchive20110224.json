 \n09:19\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0I'm working on the www.ow2.org web site, I opened a new Space and I would like to have a new Blog just on this space  \n09:20\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0i tried the Blog/Management page for creating the blog inside an existing space, but it didn't work  \n09:21\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0hmm, let me find the error I have ...  \n09:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you could paste it in a pastebin and give us the link, that'd be most helpful.  \n09:21\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0sure  \n09:22\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0but in fact, I din't have any error at all, the blog is just not created :(-  \n09:22\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0I don't see it in the existing blog section  \n09:23\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0don't know if this page is open to everyone but anyway ... http://www.ow2.org/view/Blog/Management  \n09:23\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0I just tried to create a blog in space Sandbox with name Wooot  \n09:24\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0then I cliked on create  \n09:24\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0... a page blink ... :)  \n09:24\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0and I see the same page, with no references to the blog that should have been created  \n09:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Unfortunately I'm not an expert on the blog application, if you wait until sdumitriu shows up he might know what is happening.  \n09:25\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0ok  \n09:25\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0thanks for listening :)  \n09:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe sorry I couldn't be more help.  \n09:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0there is no other way to rollback the version of an attachment but to download and reattach and older revision, right?  \n09:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0correct.  \n09:30\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0thanks :)  \n09:30\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0Another question, looking at the code of the Blog/Management page, I see the usage of request.sendRedirection method  \n09:30\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0this is alos used in blog.CreatePost  \n09:31\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0and both are not working on the ow2 web site  \n09:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That sounds like an issue with the reverse proxy. sendRedirect sends a Location header which perhaps the front end is stripping?  \n09:32\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0this is always the same logic:  \n09:32\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a01. if title request parameter is set, then it really creates a new page using sendRedirection()  \n09:32\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a02. if not set, just display the creation form  \n09:32\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0Ahhh, I'm no expert on theses apache stuff, but I know that we have some kind of URL rewrite  \n09:32\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0can this be the cause of the problems I see ?  \n09:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Again I'm no expert on that code but it is entirely possible.  \n09:33\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0you see ? http://www.ow2.org/Sandbox/ /xwiki/bin/xxx/ has been ripped off  \n09:34\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0Ok, i'll talk with our webmaster and see if he understand that better than me :)  \n09:34\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0Thanks again  \n09:37\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:38\u00a0<tcamberlin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:44\u00a0<tcamberlin1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:49\u00a0<tcamberlin>\u00a0has quit  \n10:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:24\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0colleague just got some weirdness  \n10:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0he tried adding some .bmp (for whatever insane reason) and turns out the WYSIWYG editor attached some broken .png in addition to the .bmp, put in image:\\*.png in the code instead of image:\\*bmp  \n10:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0XWiki Enterprise 2.7-SNAPSHOT.34766 << that's the version  \n10:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0any ideas on that?  \n10:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't think web browsers support .bmp  \n10:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh, IE just might... but what i wonder about, is there supposed to be some conversion going on?  \n10:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that accounts for this weirdness  \n10:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and is possibly broken  \n10:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't think so. I suspect it just tacked .png on the end of the name because it thought it should be an image but couldn't figure out what  \n10:30\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but why were broken .png attachments created?  \n10:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Try downloading the .png file, rename .bmp and see if it's your image.  \n10:31\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, good idea  \n10:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm doubt it  \n10:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0downloading them with Opera suggests they are zero filled  \n10:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0sounds like a bug  \n10:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Did you upload it with wysiwyg?  \n10:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yay me for creating more work for you, yet again  \n10:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0he did...  \n10:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Are you absolutely sure it is not the same file with a different name?  \n10:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Is it the same size?  \n10:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think you misunderstand me  \n10:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0he uploaded say, dna.bmp via the wysiwyg add image panel  \n10:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0dna.bmp and dna.png appeared as attachments  \n10:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0dna.bmp working, dna.png broken and zero filled  \n10:35\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0in the wiki code it said image:dna.png instead of image:dna.bmp  \n10:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that's interesting.  \n10:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Sounds like a wysiwyg bug  \n10:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it is, isn't it?! ;)  \n10:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, figure so  \n10:38\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:57\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, nice follow up  \n10:57\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0this might entirely be a IE 7 problem  \n10:58\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0IE7 has problems?  \n10:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because when the colleague tried using IE7 to view a file on a page that had \"f\u00fcr\" in the name (so a non ASCII char) it broke  \n10:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0he couldn't view the image  \n10:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but using opera it worked flawlessly  \n10:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i checked the url  \n10:59\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and while opera used unescaped '\u00fc', IE used some %BC kind of stuff  \n11:00\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so this is prolly where the entire breakage began  \n11:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm  \n11:00\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so question for me, why does the URL change in both browsers, although it does work if i use \u00fc in the name... and why can IE7 view the page but not the attachment?  \n11:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i reckon there is some different way to process the URL when used for page rather than attachment  \n11:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anyway, g2g for a while  \n11:07\u00a0<walter\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<walter\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:13\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:15\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:15\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n11:16\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0hello vmassol.

 \n14:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I see that you committed it, did you also write it?  \n14:05\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0I think it's Ludovic and Marius  \n14:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: Ping  \n14:06\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0but I'm not sure about Marius, maybe it was Cristie  \n14:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm trying to make a component on top of it, and I want to make sure I use the fields in the right way  \n14:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: I think I started it yes, based on some code from Ludovic  \n14:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but it was long ago :) so I don't remember much, I'd have to look over the code  \n14:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: what do you want to know?  \n14:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Does this description look right:  \n14:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Sandbox/ev  \n14:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Don't spend too much time on it, if something doesn't spring to mind as wrong, then it's OK.  \n14:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the only thing that is missing is param1-5 :) so it seems we though that events can have parameters  \n14:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, but I don't like them very much  \n14:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think it would be better to create typed values for them  \n14:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0For example param1 currently stores the title of the document, so I replaced it with getDocumentTitle  \n14:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And param2 is used by the new events to store the related target, thus param2->getRelatedEntity  \n14:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see, then maybe a field where events can store \"data\"  \n14:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Isn't the body enough?  \n14:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Note that the current implementation is just a wrapper on top of the activitystream plugin, so the underlying structure is the same, I just renamed some methods  \n14:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see that body is a string right now, I'm thinking of a field to store an object, but then we can have problems serializing it  \n14:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\\*\\*  \n14:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\* A larger section of text where the event can store some data.  \n14:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\*  \n14:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\* @return the body of the event  \n14:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\*/  \n14:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0String getBody();  \n14:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sounds good then, apps will take care of serializing and deserializing the data from the body field  \n15:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n15:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:43\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n15:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: i'm looking at XWikiHibernate#searchDocuments and i think there is an important issue in multiwiki and I would like you to confirm if you have some time:  \n15:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0this method is executing a query first to find documents names  \n15:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then for each name it's doing a getDocument  \n15:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's possible to call this method with checkRight=true to tel it to check right of current user for each document  \n15:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Which method?
