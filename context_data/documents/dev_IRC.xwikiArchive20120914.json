Property of a what?  \n09:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Document? Is that a word document?  \n09:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0\"Object\" is a really abstract term  \n09:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's hard for non-techies and newcomers to understand what \"Object\" means  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: yep, that's why there's propsal 5) if we want to pick another name for Object  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0MetaData  \n09:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So no, I don't agree that ObjectDefinition is much clearer and needs less documentation  \n09:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's a term  \n09:44\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0+1  \n09:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0We could call it a \"zblarg\"  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: make a proposal in answer ot the mail  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no point in sayinf it's not nice  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to propose sometihng  \n09:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I know  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we won't find someting 100% perfect  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we just need the best we can imagine  \n09:45\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0We know, my initial question was, why not XClass ?  \n09:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm not saying it's not nice, I'm countering your claim that Type is too generic  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's \u00a0\u00a0huge difference  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0between Type and Document  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one is more generic than the other  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and Stuff vs Type is also the same kind of differnce  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can't put everything in the same baf  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bag  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you're just seeing the world wirth 0 and 1 you're never going to be able to make differences between any proposal  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they'll all fail  \n09:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0agreed, on the other hand, OOP is well know, and using their term could IMO make these terms less generic  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's a valid point  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's well know by devs  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0though  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not by users  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if they don't need to see those names it's ok  \n09:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but user does not do devs, and this is devs concerned here, no ?  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0except that it's so well know  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that it clashes with the execution environment  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: it does  \n09:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0this is why I say it is related to the current vote, and could favor 4)  \n09:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm just saying that when explaining XWiki to other people, I always call them \"structured data type definition\", I try to stay away from \"object\" and \"class\"  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we want our users to be able to code apps  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in proposla 4 I hate XWiki for the wiki  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n09:49\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0again, user that will do some coding, would obviously need some programming background, and OOP is widely known  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's so misleading  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: I don't agree  \n09:49\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I agree  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0weneed \u00a0our dev model to be simple  \n09:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I agree with Vincent here, Object and Class have strong associations for devs  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I don't agree that we reuiqre that they follow an OOP course  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to be able to code in xwiki  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I've seen people asking about compiling the XClasses  \n09:50\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I do not say that, but there is chance they have already seen that  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all valid points Denis, I'm just playing devil's adovate  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0advoxate  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0advocate  \n09:50\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me if we agree to change the name for Objects, something like Metadata is not that bad since in the new model we can add metadata to almost all entities  \n09:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And trying to use java function calls to access the object properties, thinking that since that's a class, XWiki generates a real Java class, with getters and setters  \n09:51\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0as I said, since we will surely combine these word with other, I would really prefere single words, so, the structure will be preserved, and this could favor 2)  \n09:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So it is misleading  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the real quesiton for me is whether we want to stray away from what we have now  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we've been spending years educating people about Objects  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(xwiki objects that is)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have the feeling we'll have a hard time reaching consensus on this one ;)  \n09:53\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0:)  \n09:54\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0We should have done this for XWiki 1.0  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n09:59\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: does the document entity replace XWikiDocument ?

F5 works or need I do more?  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0shift+F5 I think  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or ctrl+F5  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(don't remember been 7 years since I last used IE on winXP ;))  \n16:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0F5 is just a simple refresh, it does not force a flush cache  \n16:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ctrl+F5 :)  \n16:07\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0Hm, still no joy. But it's good that I am the only one suffering and not the rest of the planet :-)  \n16:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0kwoot: what is more xactly the problem ? the tabs don't load ?  \n16:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0afaik I remember you reported this once in the past, and I think you solved it by clearing your cache. ctrl+F5 or \u00a0ctrl+r did the trick  \n16:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cand you check if ctrl+r fixes the issue ?  \n16:11\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0The tabs are shown, but all the tabs of this page show the same info, \"What technical support includes\". I looked at this before but did not find a solution. I have no clue what it is. Let me try the javascript console...  \n16:15\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0Hm, no real error messages. Strange behaviour.  \n16:19\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0Hi! It's very strange. I am not experiencing the issue either. What you could do is send an email to [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and ask for the information you need. I am sure somebody from the XWiki team will be happy to reply to your email with all the details.  \n16:19\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0kwoot: could you try using another machine or without terminal services ?  \n16:23\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0sburjan: will do soon. Other work to do and just thought, let's check again.  \n16:46\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0vmassol: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/WikiComponent+Module  \n17:30\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0did you had a working example for \"Write components entirely in documents\" in the end ?  \n17:36\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: cool  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tested with a macro  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and a listener (which didn't work)  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't tested more yet  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to find some use cases\u2026.  \n17:42\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0vmassol: what was failing exactly with the listener ?  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02 things AFAIR: 1) the reregistering (not a big deal but \u00a0a warning) and 2) it wasn't called for some reason  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I didn't get the time to invesdtigate  \n18:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:22\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<CIA-122>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to bed, if someone feels like answering a xwiki question on stackoverflow, or direct him to our mailing list: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12430953/how-to-extend-a-class-thats-not-in-my-project  \n23:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Already answered  \n23:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok :)  \n23:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0(by someone else)  \n23:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0didn't see it  \n23:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Although I don't like the solution  \n23:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's a hack  \n23:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah someone else  \n23:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0People should use Maven properly, and read our documentation  \n23:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you should answer that? :)  \n23:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Maybe we should add a basic pom for writing a custom authenticator  \n23:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or better  \n23:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a maven archetype  \n23:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Although I think the existing contrib authenticators have a proper project setup  \n23:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nn  \n23:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0before going slf4J 1.7.1 released FWIW :http://www.slf4j.org/news.html  \n23:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Did we update to 1.7?  \n23:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n23:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, good night  \n23:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
