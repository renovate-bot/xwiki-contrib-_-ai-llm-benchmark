It hasn't been maintained and afaik it isn't used in the standard distribution. WDYT?  \n10:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0lucaa: xwiki watch depends on xwiki-web-gwt right?  \n10:46\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0mflorea: yes, iirc  \n10:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so I guess it's going to be hard to make it work on 3.0 if I remove it, right?  \n10:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I mean, there's not way you can bundle it  \n10:48\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, it needs the servlet, right? and then some client side code, but the client side code is compiled with watch  \n10:48\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0right?  \n10:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, the servlet mapping from web.xml is the issue, if I remove it from the standard web.xml then you'll have to add it manually  \n10:49\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:49\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n10:50\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, watch has a service of it's own now as well  \n10:50\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0which needs to be put in web.xml  \n10:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: is this project really useless ? I'm not sure what is it exactly but its name sounds like a generic GWT stuff, i tough WYSIWYG was depending on it actually  \n10:50\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0when installing watch  \n10:51\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so since watch install is modifying web.xml it might as well add this...  \n10:51\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but I think there are some applications on extensions that use this api  \n10:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: this module was written mainly for curriki, the WYSIWYG editor doesn't depend on it. It isn't generic and it isn't maintained  \n10:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0+1 then  \n10:52\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0for example, there's a table cell edit application or something, which will not work without this api  \n10:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0lucaa: do you know which other apps depend on it?  \n10:52\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0lemme see if I can find this fast  \n10:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we can probably document in the extension page that since 3.0 it also needs to install some server side stuff  \n10:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0got from an older release in maven.xwiki.org  \n10:53\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, the only issue I see with removing it is that it will be really unmaintained  \n10:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean, not even compiled  \n10:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0with the platform  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is already compiled versions  \n10:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0which means that potentially an API change can break this and we won't even know it  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if it's not maintained it's probably already broken someway  \n10:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, at least it compiles  \n10:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0which we don't guarantee if we take it out of platform  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but we don't remove APIs usually  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we have plugin that use the same API since ages and still not broken  \n10:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and we cannot say that: \"you need to install this from here\" to have watch working, since we cannot guarantee it would at least compile  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0could be moved in watch sources  \n10:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks, and I get to support it :D  \n10:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0O:-)  \n10:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, the thing is, if we wanna rely on the fact that we don't remove API, we need to audit this module first to make sure that it's only using API  \n10:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0which I cannot guarantee as we speak  \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i'm not talking about public API, even protected XWiki api is usually not broken, either it goes to aspect or xwiki-legacy  \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0plugin don't use public API  \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not much at least  \n10:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0lucaa, besides compiling the code you'd have to compile the gwt code to be sure it works with the current gwt version, which doesn't happen. i.e. right only only the jar is generated  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys for fun I've created a jira filter that lists all issues fixed in XE 3.0 (till 3.0M3 included): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10820  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0352 issues  \n10:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so you can have the surprise that xwiki-web-gwt doesn't actually work, even if it compiles  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the future we need to generate it)  \n11:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: seems a lot of issue for only since 3.0M3  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03.0M1 -> 3.0M3  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it includes all dependent project jiras  \n11:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha right not since \u00a0but until sorry  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0transitive issues included  \n11:01\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0mflorea: yes, I agree, but that's a minimmum  \n11:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I don't see XEM, wiki manager and application manager in your list ;)  \n11:02\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0we could add the gwt compile in the build, for example  \n11:02\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in any case, you need to be aware that removing this means removing API  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't put XEM indeed since it's for XE  \n11:02\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I cannot find the prop editor application on extensions  \n11:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0lucaa: I'll leave it for now, but I don't like it. The code is very old, written for the first versions of gwt  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually normally issues created during the timeframe should't be listed too (like bugs we've introduced in say 3.0M1 and fixed in 3.0M2) but that's too hard to exclude ;)  \n11:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n11:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0mflorea: ok. I'm not for necessarily keeping it there, my only concern is that if we remove API, we need to figure out the impact  \n11:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0correctly  \n11:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: \u00a0almost impossible actually since you don't really have the info  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n11:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa, mflorea: IMO should be ok to move it and let users use the last released version if they really need to  \n11:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or even build their own  \n11:06\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0new major version is a good occcasion to remove things from the default distribution  \n11:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0will be harder to justify later  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no hurry  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can be done in 3.1, 3.2  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we should alreayd have released RC1 by now....  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there have been lots of changes again yesterday\u2026 which is slightly worrysome for a RC1 that should have been released on Monday\u2026.  \n11:08\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: that's a long filter :)  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0each new change require new full build and new tests done to be sure we're not breaking anything (since we don't add enough tests when we commit)  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: indeed  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki.org is real slow  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends actually  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from time to time  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelociter: ping  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(did you get my messages from earlier this morning about annotation tab?)  \n11:12\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0hi  \n11:12\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0when is the release ?  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0last Monday  \n11:13\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which means as soon as we can\u2026) mflorea: eta?  \n11:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0in the after noon, 2-3h  \n11:14\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0ok that should do it  \n11:15\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0Hi everybody.

 \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because you're using the jar plugin  \n11:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since you don't explicitely define the test jar as being of classifier \"tests\" and that could be changed  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that's how it's supposed to work  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: please read the doc  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the one I sent)  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Note that previous editions of this guide suggested to use <classifier>tests</classifier> instead of <type>test-jar</type>. While this currently works for some cases, it does not properly work during a reactor build of the test JAR module and any consumer if a lifecycle phase prior to install is invoked. In such a scenario, Maven will not resolve the test JAR from the output of the reactor build but from the local/remote repository.

I can have great fun with your wiki by polling for documents with ?language=:  \n16:16\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I can fill your cache with empty documents.  \n16:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but that's something else  \n16:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you don't even need language for that  \n16:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That won't work, the language must be valid to be taken into account  \n16:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can fill the cahce with empty document simply by generating random documents names and get them  \n16:18\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0ok so by removing that if, we can successfully push the escaping issue from the document name over to the language entry.  \n16:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but i don't see why is it an issue other than the cache becoming pretty useless  \n16:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: branches have been created  \n16:18\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0No, if that works then I can overwrite all real documents with empty documents so for every document you try to load, you get an empty document.  \n16:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: cool, going the break the trunk with some refactoring :)  \n16:19\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0(in the cache)  \n16:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n16:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: again i don't see why, if the key always have the language you can't have collision between document name and languages  \n16:20\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0according to sdumitriu, it is not an issue since fake languages are not accepted.  \n16:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(if the language does not contains : of course but it's not supposed to even if i don't know if it's forbidden or not technically)  \n16:20\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: can we commit in trunk on common, rendering, platform?  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for 3.1M1)  \n16:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n16:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0wait  \n16:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0commons-core for now  \n16:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: from what i understood, if the language is not taken into account it does not try to load the document or it loads the default language one  \n16:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it has nothing to do with the cache key  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ok  \n16:23\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0If you load a document, it is stored in the cache even if it is nonexistant.  \n16:23\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0(another problem for another day)  \n16:24\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0And /Main/WebHome?language=fr will collide with /Main/WebHome:fr  \n16:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure i know that but i don't see the relationship with language collision  \n16:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no it should not  \n16:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0again the key should always contains the language  \n16:25\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0So by loading /Main/WebHome:fr, I can have /Main/WebHome?language=fr evicted and replaced with an empty document.  \n16:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the second key will ends with WebHome:fr:en  \n16:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when the first one is WebHome:fr  \n16:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so you don't have any collision  \n16:25\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I thought language was empty if it was the default.  \n16:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(en or whatever is the default language document)  \n16:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's empty when you ask it  \n16:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but when you got the document from the database you have the language  \n16:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or you put the default one  \n16:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if the document does not exist  \n16:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0before putting it in the cache  \n16:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(04:15:52 PM) tmortagne: then this empty test need to be changed, a document always have some language  \n16:28\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome:fr  \n16:28\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Went the other way, since I'd just loaded ?language=fr it is still in the cache  \n16:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: i'm not telling you how it's working, i'm telling you how it should work if you don't want to have collisions  \n16:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0of coursee you can have collision now since the language is not always in the cache key  \n16:31\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I have a solution to collisions too.  \n16:31\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0final String wikiOrEmpty = (wiki == null ?

The cache shouldn't know the language of the document.  \n16:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so just not the nicest that's all but basically it's the same thing than i proposed: always ahve the language in the key, in your the language is \"\" ;)  \n16:36\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0We can handle it at a higher level IE: make sure the language is always there.  \n16:36\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Well, that function takes 3 strings, if you're handed null as the language you have to do something with it.  \n16:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: we don't release xwiki-standards-validator and xwiki-archetypes from xwiki-tools with XE right?  \n16:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Right  \n16:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I mean, they are not bundled in any way in the XE distribution  \n16:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0good, thanks  \n16:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: yes they are not bundled  \n16:43\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0String language = doc.getLanguage();  \n16:43\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if (StringUtils.isEmpty(language)) {  \n16:43\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0language = context.getWiki().getDefaultLanguage(context);  \n16:43\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}  \n16:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: I was thinking of using the default language as I said but actually the document could have a different default language  \n16:43\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Does that make sense?  \n16:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0each document define it's own default language so that does not really work  \n16:44\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0if the subwiki has a different default?  \n16:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't have better proposal that your based on \"\" right now  \n16:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: no  \n16:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in the database itself \u00a0each document can have a different default language  \n16:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0even different from the configured one  \n16:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea it's a bit... weird to be nice  \n16:46\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0sdumitriu: i am starting to get this stuff working but for some reason the left hand menu is unclickable... which part is responsible for making this work?  \n16:46\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0The trouble is that we want the user's native language, not the document's native language, right?  \n16:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there should not be too much duplicates in the cache anyway given the way the AP is working currently  \n16:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0jstoldt|Notebook: Link?  \n16:47\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0strictly local for now, sorry  \n16:47\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0i could upload the pages i did so far...  \n16:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tinypaste?  \n16:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0currently the API usually get the default document and get a translation of it based on the current language  \n16:47\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0okay, hold on  \n16:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and it return this basically if the default language and the asked one is the same  \n16:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we never really directly ask to the storage the language we want  \n16:48\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/VvyLPmrQ  \n16:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0makes us load two document which is not very nice either  \n16:49\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0note, this is WIP now and i only did one of the linked pages (Introduction)  \n16:49\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0indeed. that does slow things down.  \n16:51\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Well, I'm concerned with cache corruption, duplicate entries are here now and since it looks like they are intrinsic to a design, I'd rather not try fixing them right now.  \n16:52\u00a0<nikss>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: yep it's ok  \n16:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0can always be improved later, important thing is to fix bug first  \n16:58\u00a0<nikss>\u00a0hey with what username and password should i login to the xwiki to edit the things  \n16:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: should I release plugins affected by http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XPOM-5 ?
