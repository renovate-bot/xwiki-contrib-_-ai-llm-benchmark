I just had a thought about permissions/auth frontend/backend being connected via ldap  \n17:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I thikn i still written it somewhere in design or jira  \n17:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I should be pretty easy since LDAP it's basically the same thing, entity containing objects defined by classes  \n17:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but that's only if there is reusable server tools/abstract  \n17:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think Apache DS provide something like that  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO xwiki is rarely the centrepiece of an infrastructure so I'd say the use case is low. Supporting openid and other protocols so that xwiki can connect to a SSO system sounds a larger use case to me  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go, bbl  \n17:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep I also think it would not very used \u00a0a lot  \n17:11\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I like that as a general pattern because we end up with modules connected together by standards complicant protocols, if XWiki works then ldap works (ease of testing), and in the rare event that someone wants to query XWiki users, they have a standards compliant method available to them.  \n17:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/very/be/  \n17:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I admit though that in the case of ldap, the case is pretty weak.  \n17:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bad bad: https://www.ohloh.net/p/xwiki/contributors/294205713991  \n20:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone committed on git \"XWiki CI\" username  \n20:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm trying to fix ohloh: 1006279 lines removed....  \n20:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://www.ohloh.net/p/xwiki  \n20:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I fear that our git move is not going to make it happy  \n20:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I've removed the svn enlistemetns which were failing and making the git enlistements not be takne into account  \n20:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to wait a bit for ohloh to adjust now  \n20:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's adjusted already a bit  \n20:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we only have 4074 lines removed  \n20:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm the graph looks strange: https://www.ohloh.net/p/xwiki  \n20:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0between march and april, that's when we moved togit  \n20:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:34\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n21:38\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:10\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:57\u00a0<RenJuan>\u00a0the images in the wikimanager sa version (3.1) seem to be missing.
