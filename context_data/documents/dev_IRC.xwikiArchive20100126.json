The reference doc is just refefence and not a step by step tutorial  \nvmassol - (11:08): hwoever most of the content of the tutorial should be removed since it's in the reference doc and deprecated   \nlucaa - (11:13): vmassol: yes, the tutorial needs to be updated, and maybe some parts of it removed. But we need a step by step tutorial to guide through, to let devs know how to assemble together and use the information in the module ref doc  \nvmassol - (11:14): yes  \nvmassol - (11:14): agreed  \nmflorea - (11:24): tmortagne: how can I update l10n? I committed the macro descriptor keys but they are not counter as empty keys for the rest of the translations yet.  \ntmortagne - (11:25): mflorea: each translation file on l10n provide an \"Import/reimport default language file\"  \ntmortagne - (11:25): here it's on http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XE/XWikiCoreResources  \ntmortagne - (11:27): otherwise you can wait for tonight for it to be done automatically  \ntmortagne - (11:27): when you will commit fr translation you can import it in l10n using \"Import\" action for fr in the table  \nmflorea - (11:27): ok, thanks  \ntmortagne - (11:28): note: \"Import/reimport \u00a0default language file\" take a long time because there is a lot of translation so its possible you get a timeout  \nvmassol - (11:29): I hope JV didn't have any good reason for adding this CreatePage document.... :)  \ntmortagne - (11:30): mflorea: what is \"rendering.macroContent=Content\" ?  \ntmortagne - (11:30): isn't it part of the WYSIWYG UI ?  \nmflorea - (11:30): the label for the macro content  \nmflorea - (11:31): it's like the name of a parameter  \nmflorea - (11:32): s/label/name. It is used as label.  \ntmortagne - (11:33): hmm ok  \ntmortagne - (11:34): we will have to improve en values for enums i think  \ntmortagne - (11:34): \"VERY\\_SMALL\" is not very pretty fur UI  \nmflorea - (11:34): yes, we can change the translations  \ntmortagne - (11:36): defaultValue is not a label, it's a technical value  \ntmortagne - (11:36): should not be part of the translations keys  \nmflorea - (11:39): wait, I had a reason for adding it  \ntmortagne - (11:40): you maybe have a hack for some reason on WYSIWYG but it has nothing to do in the translations keys  \nmflorea - (11:41): no, for instance you have a String parameter that represents the title displayed somewhere. You can have a default title, translated in all the langauges  \ntmortagne - (11:43): mflorea: it only make sense for strings value and not even all strings values  \nmflorea - (11:44): yes, for the rest, the default value is empty string or one of the enum constants  \ntmortagne - (11:45): sure but i don't see the point of having useless thing in the translation resource file, it will just mek more complex for translator to know what to do  \ntmortagne - (11:46): for now we don't have the use case for any macro AFAIK  \ntmortagne - (11:46): default values for things like title are generally empty strings  \ntmortagne - (11:48): that's weird i seen you committ mail but i can't find the keys you added in http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/resources/ApplicationResources.properties  \nmflorea - (11:49): yes, I went through all the defaultValues and they are either numbers, enum constants, technical values (like CSS class) or empty so it's ok to remove them.  \ntmortagne - (11:50): i will clean them (but when i can get your modification, i don't understand what's wrong with svn)  \nmflorea - (11:50): yes they are, search for \"macro descriptors\"  \ntmortagne - (11:50): browser cache issue it seems  \ntmortagne - (11:50): first time i have this issue on svn repo  \nmflorea - (11:52): ok, so you want to remove the defaultValue keys? otherwise I can remove them myself.  \ntmortagne - (11:53): if you can do it easily would be cool  \ntmortagne - (11:53): at worst i can always do a regexp on Eclipse  \nmflorea - (11:54): I would do the same :)  \ntmortagne - (11:54): ok  \ntmortagne - (11:54): also i don't think categories should be mixed with macro descriptors like it is in your committ  \ntmortagne - (11:55): since it's too different things  \nmflorea - (11:56): that is because in my code I translate macro descriptors, not macro categories. that is, I have a method that gets a macro descriptor and translates it, logging the keys. I can separate manually the categories.  \ntmortagne - (11:57): ok you can move rendering.macroContent=Content with categories too since it's also a general macro related translation  \nmflorea - (11:57): ok, I'll do so  \ntmortagne - (11:58): will be easier to extract macro translations without breaking general translations latter  \nvmassol - (12:08): !shutdown  \nxwiki-bridge left at 12:08 (Remote closed the connection  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 12:08  \nvmassol - (12:08): hmm still cannot connect to jabber, I wonder why  \nvmassol - (12:12): guys I don't like this property name and value:   \nvmassol - (12:12): platform.core.profile.editMode=Menu edit mode  \nvmassol - (12:12): since it's not just about menu mode  \nvmassol - (12:12): it affects several other places  \nvmassol - (12:13): (it's for simple and advanced users)  \nvmassol - (12:15): guys should we all move back to jabber now?  \nvmassol - (12:15): I see marius and thomas are not logged on jabber right now  \nvmassol - (12:16): it looks more stable to me  \ntmortagne - (12:16): vmassol: ok, but bridge does not seems to work, right ?  \nvmassol - (12:16): yes we need to fix it  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 12:16  \nvmassol - (12:17): for ex guillaume and jerome are only on jabber  \nmflorea - (12:17): vmassol: you said \"hmm still cannot connect to jabber, I wonder why\" how is it more stable?  \nvmassol - (12:17): jerome is here now  \nvmassol - (12:17): mflorea: the bridge has an issue   \nvmassol - (12:17): not me  \nvmassol - (12:17): we're 15 on jabber right now  \nmflorea - (12:17): ok  \nvmassol - (12:17): 16 actually  \njvelo - (12:17): I'm there  \njvelo - (12:17): :)  \nmflorea - (12:17): I can switch  \njvelo - (12:17): jabber was very slow for me  \nvmassol - (12:17): I think we should be on both FTM  \njvelo - (12:17): but worked  \nvmassol - (12:18): yes just realized it's slow for me too  \ntmortagne - (12:18): jabber is very very slow for me  \nvmassol - (12:18): so maybe let's stay on both for a few days more?  \nvmassol - (12:18): let's also fix the bridge....  \nvmassol - (12:18): I tried the other day and couldn't understand why it wasn't working  \nvmassol - (12:18): the config looks ok to me  \ntmortagne - (12:18): maybe the bridge just get a timeout  \nmflorea left at 12:19 (\"Leaving.\"  \ntmortagne - (12:19): it took me more than 2 minutes to connect  \nvmassol - (12:19): hey marius come back :)  \nvmassol - (12:20): what about: platform.core.profile.userMode=User Mode ?  \nvmassol - (12:21): (instead of platform.core.profile.editMode=Menu edit mode)  \nvmassol - (12:22): or user Type  \nvmassol - (12:22): since that's also the technical field name  \nvmassol - (12:22): sounds even better than mode to me  \ntmortagne - (12:24): yes  \njvelo - (12:24): vmassol, here the message I propose upon initial import of the XE XAR: \"You have imported XWiki Enterprise default set of documents.

 \nlucaa - (14:01): actually, mflorea, any opinion on the tests attached to XWIKI-2907 ?   \ntmortagne - (14:02): vmassol: i don't know since we tested with 1.7 it could be any version between 1.3 and 1.7 you try to migrate to more recent version  \nlucaa - (14:02): do you think we should keep them and try to apply them?

 \nmflorea - (14:05): I doubt  \nlucaa - (14:05): mflorea: I doubt as well  \ntmortagne - (14:06): vmassol: what i mean is that it's a migration issue 1.3.1 does not have any attachment issue  \nlucaa - (14:06): that's the main reason for not trying to update them  \nmflorea - (14:06): ok  \nvmassol - (14:06): tmortagne: not sure i understand, could you update the isse as you see fit?

 \nvmassol - (14:07): btw mflorea are you using eclipse or idea for gwt dev?  \ntmortagne - (14:07): vmassol: 1.3.1 work well, 1.7 works well too but when you try to migrate the database (you have a 1.3.1 with its database and you change the jars) all attachments are broken, i guess attachment format changed at some point and the migration is not very good  \nvmassol - (14:08): tmortagne: yes it's a migration issue  \nvmassol - (14:08): the question I was asking myself is whether we'll fix it  \nvmassol - (14:08): I'd say no since it's old  \nvmassol - (14:09): and for old support xwiki sas can be contacted or patches sent   \nvmassol - (14:09): but not sure  \nmflorea - (14:09): vmassol: yes, it's a nice feature. We could maybe use it for the editor but I don't know how right now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:10): vmassol: re: same registration features in the admin lightbox: (Was making coffee) \u00a0The original method dodged the top bar, panels etc (in the lightbox) by having a separate template for the admin user add feature.

Why this conclusion?  \nlucaa - (15:04): '.' is (will be) escaped in document names so will also be escaped in object names. \u00a0  \nlucaa - (15:04): I don't understand exactly...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:05): I think as few characters as possible should be escaped.  \nlucaa - (15:05): yes, but why should . be escaped in object names?  \nmflorea - (15:05): tmortagne: I have the updated ApplicationResources\\_fr.properties file but I don't think I have the the right to import/update it on l10n. I have only \"Get as application resource\" and \"Compare with app resource\" admin actions.  \nlucaa - (15:06): not because it's a property separator. if it's the prop separator it needs to be escaped in properties  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:06): Suppose you want to refer to document^objectwith.dot not the dot property of objectwith  \ntmortagne - (15:07): mflorea: hmm i think i made it viewable only by admins since it's dangerous, maybe you don't have proper right  \ntmortagne - (15:07): let me see  \nlucaa - (15:07): CalebJamesDeLisl: \u00a0but resolving as OBJECT or OBJECT\\_PROPERTY is \\_not\\_ given by the presence or absence of separators, but by the EntityType parameter passed to the resolver  \ntmortagne - (15:08): mflorea: you should see it now  \nlucaa - (15:08): in the same way you might want to refer to a document with name Page^somenamehere.andadot  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:08): Ok. I had assumed that this standard would pass on to URLs  \nlucaa - (15:08): you don't need to escape anything  \ntmortagne - (15:08): mflorea: shure you merged with current state of l10n before committing ? (just checking :))  \nmflorea - (15:09): I took the ApplicationResources\\_fr.properties file from l10n and add the macro translations  \nlucaa - (15:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: but no, why? we're not defining formats to pass as urls... just the same as we don't use Space.Page in URLs for docs, but the path separator...  \ntmortagne - (15:10): mflorea: ok  \nmflorea - (15:11): I did a diff with the one from svn, only two keys have different values, but I used the one from l10n. The one from svn will be overwritten before the release, right?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:11): If I had the decision, I'd use . for Space.page in urls, so many time I want to copy/paste a name into the url.  \nmflorea - (15:11): tmortagne: also, what's the policy regarding special characters, i.e. diacritics. Must they be escaped?  \ntmortagne - (15:12): mflorea: the one from svn are overridden before each release yes (when i don't forget)  \ntmortagne - (15:12): mflorea: in properties files ?  \nmflorea - (15:12): yes  \nmflorea - (15:12): escaped=encoded  \nmflorea - (15:12): \\uxxx  \ntmortagne - (15:13): everything in properties files has to be encoded  \ntmortagne - (15:13): that's one of the main bnefit of l10n.xwiki.org, be able to easily edit translations without taking care of encoding  \nmflorea - (15:13): is there a way to do this automatically? The translation I got from Guillaume is not encoded  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:13): lucaa: More to the point, I like using a small set of special characters not just for escaping but because it's more simplistic.  \nmflorea - (15:14): tmortagne: so if I import the translations on l10n they will be encoded properly?  \nlucaa - (15:14): CalebJamesDeLisl: I like the idea of the . too. I just didn't understand the argumentation, I wasn't arguing the usage of the .  \nmflorea - (15:15): or does l10n expect the imported resource file to be encoded  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:15): I understand ^ because we want to have nested spaces so wiki:Space.Space.Space.Doc^Object.prop  \ntmortagne - (15:15): mflorea: i see, Guillaume is lazy, i don't remember the name of the tool to encode properties files  \nmflorea - (15:16): ok, let me seach  \nvmassol - (15:16): native2ascii It hink  \ntmortagne - (15:17): mflorea: properties file has to be encoded i don't know what will happen if you try to import wrong properties file, l10n use standard JAVA Properties parser  \ntmortagne - (15:17): yes native2ascii  \nmflorea - (15:17): ok, I'll play safe and encode the file before importing it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:17): So . will only have to be escaped from either object names or property names, and the logic can say find the first or last . depending on implementation.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:19): lucaa: Something I have wanted to add (lot of work) would be nested objects which might lead to wiki:Space.Space.Space.Doc^Obj.Obj.prop Is it worth it to escape . in objects and properties now rather than possibly run into incompatibility in the future?  \nlucaa - (15:20): nested objects?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:20): Like in java, object behaves like property.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:21): xwiki property == java primitive.  \nlucaa - (15:21): and also, that's a \\_model\\_ decision: 1/ how do we define nested objects, 2/ do we support them 3/ how do we reference them  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:23): Ok, since not a line of code is written (and probably won'd be for a long time), I won't push it any further.  \nsdumitriu - (15:36): CalebJamesDeLisl: this has been asked several times by users  \nsdumitriu - (15:36): But I think that relations are better  \nsdumitriu - (15:36): And enough  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:37): Which?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:37): sdumitriu: \u00a0nested objects?  \nsdumitriu - (15:37): Yes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:38): The code would be horrible and would probably change the schema beyond recognition so I concur.  \nsdumitriu - (15:39): Could I get more votes on the edit improvements?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:42): Sorry, I am 0 on all UI stuff.  \nvmassol - (15:43): sdumitriu: I'll reply again later today, need time to re-read all comments ;) My main point is against moving panel content to the main area, not the rest  \nsdumitriu - (15:43): That's excellent  \nvmassol - (15:43): :)  \nsdumitriu - (15:43): CalebJamesDeLisl: You can come with a clean user perspective  \nsdumitriu - (15:44): We don't need the oppinions of experts  \nsdumitriu - (15:44): But those of end users  \nsdumitriu - (15:44): Usability is about users  \nvmassol - (15:44): ok you'll love my opinion since I'm not a UI expert :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:44): Is it in the latest hudson build?  \nsdumitriu - (15:44): Experts can only guess what users like, but the users are those that do the liking  \nsdumitriu - (15:45): Nope, just here: http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Improvements/ImprovedEdit  \nsdumitriu - (15:45): I don't have a public IP now, otherwise I would have given you a live link  \nsdumitriu - (15:46): (I'll have one in the weekend)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:48): Can it be turned off by an admin?

 \nvmassol - (17:17): (maybe it was fixed in your refactoring.... who knows...)  \njvelo - (17:20): vmassol, no I don't think it's fixed  \nvmassol - (17:21): ok  \njvelo - (17:24): (though the particular issue of AllAttachmentsResults has been fixed IIRC)  \nvmassol - (17:28): tmortagne: I thought you did http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-4164 but I see in the top level pom that we're still using version 2.2  \ntmortagne - (17:29): vmassol: no i did not done it  \nvmassol - (17:29): ok  \nvmassol - (17:32): let's see if I can do it quickly  \nvmassol - (17:32): I already have a checkstyle 5 xml file that I had done previously  \nsdumitriu - (17:34): Marius also wrote a patch for it  \ntmortagne - (17:34): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XTVERIFICATIONS-9  \nvmassol - (17:35): ok thanks  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:39): What do you think of putting $Id$ in the document save comment of an application, it would be nice to check the revision number.  \nvmassol - (17:41): CalebJamesDeLisl: I think it's wayyyyy too technical for end users  \nvmassol - (17:41): (if I understand correctly what you mean)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:42): I just want it for me to be able to look at the revision number in my app.  \nvmassol - (17:42): you mean having <comment>$Id$</comment> in the xml files right?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:42): yes.  \nvmassol - (17:42): (don't recall the exact tag name)  \njvelo - (17:43): not sure it's the right place  \njvelo - (17:43): when importing the importer now write it's own version comment  \njvelo - (17:43): so what's in the XML will not persist  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:44): I just want to quickly check in the xar file.  \njvelo - (17:44): ah you mean in the XAR, not the wiki  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:45): Just so I know how many tests i'm still breaking.  \njvelo - (17:45): maybe then the best place is the package.xml no?  \nvmassol - (17:46): CalebJamesDeLisl: so what you want is simply a rev in the version of the product right?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:46): That's it.  \nvmassol - (17:46): we do that for non snapshot versions already  \nvmassol - (17:47): we can do it for snapshot versions too easily  \nvmassol - (17:47): ah the reason we don't do it for snapshots btw  \nvmassol - (17:47): is because it takes a bit more time for svn to find the revision  \nvmassol - (17:47): AFAIR  \nvmassol - (17:47): so we didn't want to slow down the build  \nvmassol - (17:47): would need to be rechecked  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:48): It's fine, BTW: I finally found the pb with the web standards tests.  \nvmassol - (17:53): cool  \nvmassol - (17:55): mflorea: did you get checkstyle plugin 2.4 to work? I'm getting a NPE  \nvmassol - (17:57): ok I think it's not compatible with maven 3.x  \nvmassol - (17:57): http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCHECKSTYLE-123  \nmflorea - (17:58): vmassol: I don't think I've tried. I'm using maven 2.2 let me try  \nvmassol - (17:58): jvelo: I'd really love to have jira 4.x for us too! See for ex: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCHECKSTYLE  \nvmassol - (17:59): the activity stream alone would be a huge booster  \nflorinciu - (18:00): +1 for jira 4.x  \njvelo - (18:01): vmassol, I'll make sure we don't forget;) we made good progress on the VPN so we should be able to make some time for other things soon  \njvelo - (18:01): vmassol, it's probably Alex that will take care of this  \nflorinciu left #xwiki at 18:02  \nvmassol - (18:07): mflorea: so it's not working with m3  \nvmassol - (18:07): I'll keep the current version for now  \nmflorea - (18:07): vmassol: how can I force checkstyle plugin to use http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XTVERIFICATIONS-9 . Building platform/tools/xwiki-verificaction-tools doesn't help  \nvmassol - (18:11): mflorea: wdyM?  \nvmassol - (18:11): how to modify the top level pom?  \nvmassol - (18:11): you need to do this:  \nvmassol - (18:11): 1) update pom/pom.xml to use checkstyle 2.4  \nmflorea - (18:11): done  \nvmassol - (18:11): 2) update pom/pom.xml to use verification dep version 1.15-SNAPSHOT  \nvmassol - (18:11): 3) replace checkstyle.xml in verification module with the new one  \nmflorea - (18:12): 3) done  \nmflorea - (18:12): I have to do 2)  \nvmassol - (18:12): 4) rebuild pom/ module manually before building the others  \nvmassol - (18:12): (not sure 4) is required if the relative paths are set correcdtly)  \nmflorea - (18:13): I'm updating only the pom of the module I'm experimenting on. should work  \ntmortagne - (18:18): need hql expert: i have \"sql select count(distinct rcs.id) as contributions, rcs.author from XWikiDocument as doc, BaseObject as obj, XWikiRCSNodeInfo as rcs where doc.fullName=obj.name and obj.className='L10NCode.TranslationClass' and rcs.id.docId=doc.id and rcs.author <> 'XWiki.XWikiTranslator' \u00a0group by rcs.author\" to get contributions by user and i would like to order it but a simple \"order by contributions\" at the end does not see  \ntmortagne - (18:18): sdumitriu maybe ?

should we display more users ? you can see all contributors in http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/L10NCode/BestContributorsSheet  \ntmortagne - (19:38): (almost 50 contributors btw)  \ntmortagne - (19:39): there is just something weird with user \"HelloKitty1\", looks like it has been removed at some point  \ntmortagne - (19:40): note that all modification are counted here (new translation, modification of translations and validation of translations)  \ntmortagne - (19:41): (basically it's just based on each version of a translation document by author)  \nvmassol - (19:41): tmortagne: cool, could you increase to the top 10 ?  \nvmassol - (19:42): I might have removed one hello kitty, that sounds familiar  \ntmortagne - (19:42): sure, i was just woried that it would make \"Latest Translations\" not visible anymore (but maybe only big definition can see it already anyway)  \nvmassol - (19:43): a panel would be better IMO  \nvmassol - (19:43): that's the point of panel, to move non essential stuff on the side ;)  \nvmassol - (19:44): (private joke)  \ntmortagne - (19:44): maybe  \ntmortagne - (19:44): since it's pretty small it's ok in a panel  \nvmassol - (19:44): yes  \nvmassol - (19:44): type: Uers--> Users  \nvmassol - (19:45): s/type/typo/  \nvmassol - (19:45): I hope these contribs are valid: http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/ZL :)  \nvmassol - (19:45): (I don't like when people don't use real names)  \nvmassol - (19:48): yes re hello kitty that person was spamming us  \nvmassol - (19:48): (I remember now)  \ntmortagne - (19:49): ok  \ntmortagne - (19:49): i will filter contribution where user doe snot exists anymore  \nvmassol - (19:49): not sure, you could leave them  \nvmassol - (19:49): a user could have contributed for some time and decided to quit  \ntmortagne - (19:50): for no i will leave them since it's a pain to do that in the hql request :)  \nvmassol - (19:50): :)  \ntmortagne - (19:50): it's ok since hellokity doe snot have many modifications  \nvmassol - (19:50): right  \nvmassol - (19:51): I'd like to redesign the home page a bit  \nvmassol - (19:51): to put the how to help in a small box on the top right in order to focus more the home on the status or something like that  \nvmassol - (19:52): maybe sergiu, marta, caty and jv would have some ideas too  \nvmassol - (19:52): to make the home page secy  \nvmassol - (19:52): sexy  \nvmassol - (19:52): I think that sexy home pages help people contribute in general :)  \nvmassol - (19:52): sexy but social  \nvmassol - (19:52): social sexy! :)  \ntmortagne - (19:52): does not render very well in panel  \nvmassol - (19:52): too long names?
