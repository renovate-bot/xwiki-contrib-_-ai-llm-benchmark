It's always recommended to upgrade as soon as possible since the bug fixes can contain security fixes.  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can argue that this for platform and not for extensions though  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and each extension defines its own rule  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to fix this asap btw  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll start working on standardizing this real soon  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but here it's more like someone thought that after 1.9 it has to be 2.0  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and not 1.10)  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:58\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0acotiuga: that should have been 2.1 IMO since 2.0.6 is not a bugfix release, TBD w/ mflorea  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n15:19\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0It was discussed with mflorea  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then we need to better agree about the rules for FM. I thought they should follow the dev.xwiki.org rules mflorea?  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/VersioningAndReleasePractices )  \n15:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I don't see the problem  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was a bugfix release with no bug fixes :)  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sounds strange to me  \n15:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it has minor improvements, it doesn't deserve a new version  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you're defining some new rules  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is ok but needs to be discussed  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becasue that's not what we have ATM  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0minor is the second number  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not the third  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in A.B.C  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so maybe we should change the definition of \"bugfix\", i.e. the third number?  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we would need a defintion  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR we also have the same issue with XWiki releases  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example when we release 7.4.1 it doesn't only contain bugfixes (even though it's supposed to)  \n15:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10010&version=16282  \n15:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I see many improvement and even some new feature  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and?  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(did you see what I wrote above?)  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now the version numbering for extensions is kind of a joke  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are no 2 extensions that do the same  \n15:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we haven't been following this rule very strictly, which is fine for me  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well not exactly  \n15:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in some cases you may need/want to include an improvement in a minor version  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when?  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the difference between minor and \"more minor\"?  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what we need to define  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for xwiki releases we don't put stuff that are not bugfix in general, we put those for the next minor release  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when we have improvemnts it's usually because they are needed to fix bugs/issues that make the predvious version not very usable  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway all I'm saying that right now I don't see the difference between 2.0.3 or 2.1 for extensions  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know the rule and I don't know what to use as a conrib dev  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and as a user it means nothing  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can't be guaranteed that you won't have regression when using a bugfix release  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there' also the issue of frequent releases for extensions  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally I'd favor just 2 digits for extensions  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/digitS/numbers  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0A.B (major.minor)  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we do frequent releases  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway....  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reason that I'm mentipnig this is because we're starting to organize the contrib extensions ATM  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we'll have more when we move platform stuff there  \n15:34\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n15:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Drama in My IRC Channel?!  \n15:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0.77.99.55] has quit [K-Lined] <--  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bye bye alex, was nice to meet you!  \n15:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I think that's maybe his quit message.
