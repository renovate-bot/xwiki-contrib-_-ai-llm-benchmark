 \ncjdelisle - (20:42): it's the xwiki-enterprise-2.4/pom.xml  \nnpm - (20:42): oh, in the xar.  \ncjdelisle - (20:43): No, in the maven repository.  \nnpm - (20:43): so i could, being the hacker, unpack the xar and correct it, then repack and import?  \ncjdelisle - (20:43): err the svn repo.  \ncjdelisle - (20:44): Theoretically yes but it would probably be easier to correct the pom file and build.  \nnpm - (20:44): depends on whether maven cache has been updated recently :-)  \ncjdelisle - (20:46): I just did the build myself and I'm running the tests now.  \ncjdelisle - (20:52): oops just broke a test, trying to type and the window pops up.  \ncjdelisle - (20:52): you could but you'd have to set up your own maven project.  \ncjdelisle - (20:57): hmm I never knew an image could be base64 encoded in a webpage.  \ncjdelisle - (20:58): \"data:image/jpeg;base64\"  \nnpm - (20:58): sounds like a good performance booster  \nnpm - (20:59): assuming you can combine datas for multiple images into html for main doc  \ncjdelisle - (21:00): Always wondered why the google video thumbnails never showed up when google was noscripted.  \ncjdelisle - (21:00): I guess javascript unpacks it and creates the image.  \nnpm - (21:00): i was about to mention that the technique would be good for js apps  \nnpm - (21:01): otherwise how would these images be \"cached\"  \nnpm - (21:01): if not per page  \ncjdelisle - (21:04): I was reading about evercookies which were able to cache data in png images.  \ncjdelisle - (21:04): Basically post data to the server, it returns same data as a png. request same png with no data posted, server sends a \"not modified\" and it loads from the cache.  \ncjdelisle - (21:05): Then javascript could load data from the png file.  \nnpm - (21:33): if people don't want that feature of they web, they should use lynx or w3 in emacs :-)  \ncjdelisle - (21:35): \"don't want that feature of they web\" you mean if they don't want to be tracked?  \ncjdelisle - (21:39): v0.02  \ncjdelisle - (22:14): I have an unofficial build here, I'm doing a little manual testing first, I can post the xar if you want it.  \ncjdelisle - (22:35): npm: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/XWiki/Caleb\\_James\\_DeLisle/xwiki%2Denterprise%2D2.4.2%2D2%2Dunofficial.xar \u00a0\u00a0This seems to fix the panel parent issue.  \ncjdelisle - (22:36): Keep in mind, it's unofficial. I'm not the release manager.  \nnpm - (22:40): sweet! thanks  \nnpm - (22:42): and what would i look for for signs of success? or is the parent panel issue a fundamental showstopper  \ncjdelisle - (22:44): I just checked it against the official release, the only (known) problem with the official was when you edited a page, you couldn't set the parent from the panel.  \ncjdelisle - (22:45): That is apparently fixed, I also random checked some other stuff which breaks easily, no signs of trouble.  \ncjdelisle - (22:46): All of the ui-tests pass (2 have problems but tinkering with the tests made them work.)  \nnpm - (22:50): will test on other wikis in vwiki setup, but this one worked so far  \nnpm left at 23:05 (Read error: Operation timed out  \n\n"}
