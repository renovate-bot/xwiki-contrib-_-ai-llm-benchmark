What changed is that before you called xpage=passwd from a WikiUser page (and if it was not the case, it triggered the 400 error), but now ChangePassword is a page in itself  \n13:42\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0Perhaps that's why. What are exactly these tests who failed supposed to do ?  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check the pom.xml in xwiki-enterprise-test  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are several configuration sections  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(btw all stuff related to escaping should be moved to the escapeing test pom.xml but that's another matter)  \n13:51\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0I found that in the pom.xml for the escaping tests : \"templates/passwd\\.vm <!-- must be tested on a user document, otherwise returns status 400 -->\"  \n13:51\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0So that's why it passed before I guess  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a new vm now?  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0passwd.vm?  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0scratch that  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the existing one  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mentioned a page  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it means we cannot change the password in an empty wiki?  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still see passwd.vm  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as you can see I have no precise idea about what you've done :))  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it somewhere in the release notes?  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(so that I can check)  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't find it on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki51M1  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6882 is still open  \n13:56\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0No I didn't changed the old passwd.vm but I redirect the change of passwords to a new page ChangePassword  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and indeed I commented on the issue already about the missing doc  \n13:56\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0(I made it that way because I wanted to use groovy at the beginning)  \n13:56\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0In fact XWiki-6882 is not finished yet : there is still the cache issue  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but since the commit has been done and quite some time ago  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should have split into several issues  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and closed what's been done  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and documented it  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you point me where you direct to changepassword instead of passwd.vm?  \n13:57\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0The new page is XWiki.ChangePassword  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I see that you have a specific issue for this but it was closed as dup which is not nice IMO it should be the other way artound :)  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I know that  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but where is it used?  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found it  \n13:59\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0XWiki.XWikiUserPreferencesSheet  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/ac4f77e25e1e199978c440a394bd63c110ae81f4/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-user/xwiki-platform-user-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/XWikiUserPreferencesSheet.xml#L88  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if I understand correctly:  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- in an empty wiki passwd.vm is still used  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- in a wiki with the admin app the new ChangePassword page is used  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that it?  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing  \n14:01\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0Yes should be  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to understand when passwd.vm is used now  \n14:02\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0The way I saw it was that passwd.vm was not supposed to be used anymore  \n14:02\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0But I didn't consider the empty wiki case  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok just tested and there's no UI link to passwd.vm to change the password  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdym?  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(wdym by \"was not supposed to be used anymore)  \n14:03\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0I mean that to my mind, normally all users would change their passwords through ChangePassword  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ChangePassword isn't new?  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"but I redirect the change of passwords to a new page ChangePassword\"  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to me this means you added it, no?  \n14:04\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0Yes  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why did you say \"was not supposed to be used anymore\"  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what was the other option before your change?  \n14:05\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0There was no other option that passwd.vm  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok so you forgot to handle passwd.vm  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a pretty important change  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since before we were able to change passwords without the admin app but now it's not possible  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to decide if that's ok  \n14:05\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0I let passwd.vm be because of backward compatibility concern  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bt I don't see any doc in it about that!!!!  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where is this documented?  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(except in your head :))  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how am I supposed to know?  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not a minor change, it's prtty serious  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's very serious actually because people used to override passwd.vm  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and now all their apps will be broken  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/apps/customizations/  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becauise passwd.vm won't be called anymore  \n14:07\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0I was thinking I should document it when closing the whole issue... Sorry about that  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it would have required some proposal (maybe you sent it but I missed it?)  \n14:08\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0Actually now that I don't need groovy, I think I can use passwd.vm to do the same thing.  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0removing a vm file usage is pretty serious  \n14:08\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0I didn't made a proposal. I stressed it in my PR but had no return about that  \n14:09\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0So I thougth it was OK  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I guess only sergiu looked at the PR (but not very closely)  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not your fault)  \n14:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm currently upgrading myxwiki.org btw  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reproduce the webstandrards issues on the 3 failin gtests  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*reproduced  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tdelafosse: I'm pretty sure it's the same problem as for the escaping tests  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so they'll get fixed automatically when you move your changes to passwd.vm and remove ChangePassword.xml  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n18:01\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:58\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n19:06\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:45\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n20:47\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:05\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:39\u00a0<Dale\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:40\u00a0<Dale\\_>\u00a0I have a quick question about upgrading from 4.2 to 4.5.3  \n22:40\u00a0<Dale\\_>\u00a0I'm getting the following error: The index 'ase\\_requestid' is dependent on column 'ase\\_requestid'  \n22:40\u00a0<Dale\\_>\u00a0I can alter this by hand, but should I? \u00a0Will there be many more?  \n23:28\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
