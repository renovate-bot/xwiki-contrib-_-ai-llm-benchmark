 \ntmortagne - (11:50): vmassol: i guess it depends how the panel is written, what panels in wrapped and should not ?  \nvmassol - (11:51): tmortagne: have a look here: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Panels/  \nvmassol - (11:51): (I'm taking about the description field)  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 11:51  \ntmortagne - (11:52): vmassol: probably a xwiki/2.0 vs xwiki/1.0 panels thing  \ntmortagne - (11:53): i guess when you render xwiki/2.0 panel description you get a <p> around it because that's the way rendering is working, i.e. the description is not parsed as inline content when you parse it alone  \ntmortagne - (11:54): we need a parse inline tools accessible from velocity like we do in java for some use cases  \nvmassol - (11:59): indeed you're right  \nvmassol - (11:59): it's a 1.0 vs 2.0  \nvmassol - (12:00): hmmm  \nvmassol - (12:00): do we want to limit descirption to text only and not render it for now?  \nvmassol - (12:02): it would make a bit of sense since the value is used in a list and rendering it might cause some pb  \ntmortagne - (12:03): vmassol: well, that would be a API breakage but appart from this i don't think it's reallt necessary to render panel description, or at least is should be inline content  \nannacondan left at 12:03 (Quit: annacondan  \nvmassol - (12:04): actually the desc should have been a string property probably istead  \nvmassol - (12:04): instead  \nvmassol - (12:06): so how do we display a textarea in a list so that it always looks nice  \nvmassol - (12:06): ?  \nvmassol - (12:06): maybe in a livetable  \nvmassol - (12:06): instead  \nvmassol - (12:06): yes I know, I like livetables ;)  \ntmortagne - (12:07): vmassol: we do the same trick we use in places we need inline content waiting for real inline parser  \nvmassol - (12:07): tmortagne: I'm talking about UI  \nvmassol - (12:07): using a livetable makes the most sense to me actually  \ntmortagne - (12:07): as always ;)  \nvmassol - (12:07): yep  \nvmassol - (12:08): it's most consistnet with the rest  \nvmassol - (12:08): s/most/more/  \ntmortagne - (12:08): XWiki will turn into Excel :)  \nvmassol - (12:08): it also scales if there are lots of panels  \nannacondan joined #xwiki at 12:08  \ntmortagne - (12:09): yep  \ntmortagne - (12:09): livetable is the best we have for dynamic list of things  \nannacondan left at 12:10 (Client Quit  \nvmassol - (12:11): ok I'll try my livetable skills....  \njvelociter - (12:12): tmortagne: BTW did you \"order\" a nice icon for the admin Search category ?
