 \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:30): newboy I think you can do it edit the concerned panel right  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:31): newboy if somebody is not allowed to view that specific panel, it won't display for him  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:31): jvelociter: so I need to go to panels home then click edit on the concerned panel  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:31): than edit page permissions for the panel?  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:31): yes  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:32): page rights  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:32): if I set the group permission to allow and leave the user blank is there any other reason a particular user might not be able to view?  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:33): jvelociter: do you think there may be some global rights overriding the panels config?  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:33): the moment you allow view explicitely for a an entity (group or user) it denies this rights for the others entities  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:34): and that's something important to get when dealing with rights  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:34): well, I have is explicitly allowed for 3 groups but only two of them can see  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:34): so yes, maybe it's a conflict with other rights at space/wiki level  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:35): I think that if two rights conflits, the less permissive wins  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:35): almost certainly, where do I set those rights?  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:35): which would mean in your case, the group cannot see the panels  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:35): you can look at the space rights, or global rights from the administration UI  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:35): ok, I have been stupid, Isee what I should do now  \njvelociter - (05/08/2008 16:35): :) cool  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:37): jvelociter: if I want a particular group to be only able to view pages I explicitly say they can but not able to view the others, should I leave global blank?  \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:47): ok, jvelociter, this is crazy. for a user to be able to view panels in a page they need to have edit rights for that page.   \nnewboy - (05/08/2008 16:47): how can that be possible?
