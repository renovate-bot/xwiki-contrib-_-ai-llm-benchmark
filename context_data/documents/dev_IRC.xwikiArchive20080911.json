In my case mouseout is not triggered. Let me try this outside GWT  \nsdumitriu - (11/09/2008 12:15): In opera mouseout is triggered not right after the other element appears, but as soon as the mouse is moved  \nmflorea - (11/09/2008 12:45): sdumitriu: I can't reproduce it outside gwt so it seems to be a gwt problem. I'll debug it  \nxwikibot - (11/09/2008 12:51): Community.HallOfFame was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/HallOfFame  \nxwikibot - (11/09/2008 13:59): Design.NewCommentsImplementation was modified by xwiki:XWiki.GuillaumeLerouge -
