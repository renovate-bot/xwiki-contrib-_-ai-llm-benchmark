I do not know how to package the project which consist of a groovy class and unit test, macro cmls and a java class. The project is on github, can someone please take a look an help me get this baby wraped  \n12:30\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0\u00a0up?  \n12:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vfzevaze: what you did in https://github.com/4F2E4A2E/macro-hpqc generally looks like the way to go, is there something not working ?  \n12:34\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0well the thing is, the groovy class works on my eclipse, but how do i call the groovy class in my macro and how do i deploy this? since there is a java dependency.  \n12:34\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i could not find any information in the xar package refering to its java dependecy  \n12:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0groovy script generally goes in wiki pages  \n12:34\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0or does maven the work for me? i dont ave a clue  \n12:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you indicate in your application the jar you depends on  \n12:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is nothing special about XAR package and dependencies  \n12:35\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0you mean the param for running groovy i get that  \n12:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you do as for any other maven module  \n12:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for the groovy script it all depends how you plan to use it once in the wiki  \n12:36\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i imagine it like this, someone want to install this macro using the extension manager, the user click install and the dependency and macro will be installed...  \n12:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0could be some resource in a jar, a script in a page, I can't really tell you since I don't know how you will use it  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0extension manager follow maven dependencies  \n12:37\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i will have a groovy script creating a new object from a separeted groovy class  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the user will ask to install your application and the jar will be installed too  \n12:37\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0and that class uses functions from a java class  \n12:37\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0that's it  \n12:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok but that still does not tell me who is supposed to call your groovy script :)  \n12:38\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0but how does the extension manager know about it?  \n12:38\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0the wiki page will  \n12:38\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0on rendering the page using {{groovy}}  \n12:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vfzevaze: you declare dependencies in https://github.com/4F2E4A2E/macro-hpqc/blob/master/xwiki-hpqc-macro-application/pom.xml  \n12:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's how EM knows it  \n12:38\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0aaah  \n12:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all you need now is to deploy all that in a maven/xwiki repository  \n12:40\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0ok, thx, so i \\_do\\_ have to pass the jar param in the wiki page when using the groovy script?  \n12:40\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0if so, what about the groovy dependency? the groovy files are not beeing package anywhere...  \n12:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no you don't have to pass anything  \n12:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the jar is installed it will be in the classpath  \n12:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and the groovy script will find it  \n12:41\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0so the groovy scripts will be in the jar you say?  \n12:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n12:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the jar will be in the classpath so from the groovy script point of view executed in some wiki page it will like using any JVM class  \n12:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. there is nothing to do, the jar will just be there  \n12:43\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0ok, then i don't know how the groovy script in a wiki page can access a groovy class dependency when it is not inside the xml or jar  \n12:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vfzevaze: I don't understand you use case  \n12:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0your groovy script use what exactly ?  \n12:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you mean you have two groovy scripts ?  \n12:44\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0on a wiki page the user inserts a macro  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0one with a class and nother using that class ?  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/nother/another/  \n12:45\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0this macro contains a small groovy script creating a object inside a groovy class (.groovy)  \n12:45\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0doing e.g.: new HPQCMacro(param1, param2)  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0where is that class defined ?  \n12:46\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0and that groovy class is using a java dependency  \n12:46\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0as simple as that  \n12:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not that simple it seems :)  \n12:46\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0https://github.com/4F2E4A2E/macro-hpqc/blob/master/xwiki-hpqc-macro-api/src/main/groovy/org/xwiki/hpqc/api/HPQCMacro.groovy  \n12:46\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0did not meant it this way, sorry  \n12:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so from java point of view that's just some file that happen to be named \"HPQCMacro.groovy\"  \n12:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no way to make it directly a Java class instead ? would make it much easier to reuse  \n12:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if that's the only thing your jar contains putting that in a jar is actually useless  \n12:48\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0if no other way possible i will have to do exactly that  \n12:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is other ways  \n12:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that one is the easiest to reuse and also the best for performances  \n12:48\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i guess it was the wrong path conding a class in groovy, though it was so easy  \n12:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0another way is to put your class in another page and include that page  \n12:49\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0please be so kind and provide an example or link on how i could achieve that  \n12:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you put the class in a {{groovy}} macro in some page and you use the {{include reference=\"MyGoovyClass\"/}} in the page where you have your other groovy script script (before the actually {{groovy}} script)  \n12:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if will pretty much behave as if you have one bug script with the groovy class and the part using that class  \n12:52\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0thx alot!  \n12:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it mean it will reparse your class each time you script is used  \n12:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's why I was suggesting to put that in pure Java  \n12:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least the good thing of putting everything in wiki page is that you will only have one package  \n12:53\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0it's ugly i know, i will refactor / recode it in java  \n12:53\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0though is good to have an option  \n12:53\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0asap i would like to move this project to the xwiki-contrib  \n12:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's unless Groovy engine has some special way of searching for \\*.groovy resources located in jar file but I don't think so (but I'm not a groovy expert)  \n12:54\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0even so the groovy classes are not beeing packaged in any way  \n12:56\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0as always a great xwiki community! thanks again and have i nice day sir! ;)  \n12:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you're welcome, always happy to help for contributions ;)  \n13:22\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:25\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:42\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:48\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11927 only started with XWiki 7.0M2?  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not there in 6.4.x for example?)  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because if that's the case then it's a blocker  \n13:51\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: hello  \n13:51\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I've only tested it on M2  \n13:51\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'll take a look at 6.4.2 now  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n14:00\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: the bug also affects 6.4.2  \n14:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n14:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: bad news: the bug also affects 6.2.7  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, makes sense  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that the supported version for 6.x cycle is 6.4.x s  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/6.4.x s/6.4.x  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it would be nice to have it fixed for 6.4.3 which we need to release this week  \n14:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:20\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:20\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: we still don't have javadoc support in extensions on e.x.o right (for the Repository app)?  \n14:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: there is no real generic way of supporting javadoc at Repository app level, that would probably be a e.x.o. special thing when matching nexus.xwiki.org  \n14:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless you mean something else  \n14:36\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hello, I'm unable to edit http://extensions.xwiki.org pages (even my own http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Reinit\\_Sandbox).
