And I have to report a bug on 1.8, but I don;t have it in JIRA  \n16:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the dates of the previous releases is the date of their upload on the page in e.x.o :)  \n16:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: yes :)  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me know cjd if you have issues and I'll do it  \n16:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0cjd: stop  \n16:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0looking at https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/macro-livetable-excel-export/commit/ca8eb19d42ab456b88add99c0053fd600b254292  \n16:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0just to make sure. so 1.8 is already out. the enxt version should be 1.9  \n16:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so yes, release 1.8 on jira with the date of May 02, 2013  \n16:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the sync between extensions is jira is terrible.  \n16:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0livetable excel export macro 1.9 ?  \n16:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0as the next version, yes  \n16:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0k  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: we've started creating one jira project per contrib project  \n16:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yepp, tmortagne started it. It's a good idea  \n16:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I fully support it  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a lot of work though  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's easy to support when you're not doing it ;)  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that was the reason we didn't do it initally  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's always been like this  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no need to do it for dead project, only projects that really have activity  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's nothing to support  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we always said:  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- initil project go in xcontrib  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- when they grow larger they can get their own jira  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*initial  \n16:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sburjan: I'm \\*releasing\\* 1.9 or releasing 1.8 and creating 1.9 for future ?  \n16:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0cjd: latter  \n16:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ah ok  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0excel seems not separarted  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's version 1.9 I suggest to make it a separate jira project  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's also totally useless to create a jira project or release on jira a project that does not have a single jira issue  \n16:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCONTRIB  \n16:28\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0if someone with the propert credentials or knowledge is able to make it it would be cool  \n16:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0does this look correct?  \n16:29\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0cjd: the release date of 1.8 was May 02, 2013  \n16:30\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0not 18/Nov/13  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you didn't create jira issues for it?  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I see only 2 : http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCONTRIB-88?jql=component%20%3D%20%22Excel%20Integration%22%20AND%20project%20%3D%20XCONTRIB )  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd/sburjan: fixed  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(re the date)  \n16:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0not sure what that does  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nothing  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0overwrites  \n16:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0kk  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok going to create a new jira for this project now  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: if you could help me and find the version release dates that would help me  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: are we talking about \"Livetable Excel Export Macro\" or \"Excel Integration\"?  \n16:35\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the former there's not a single JIRA issue: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCONTRIB/component/12444  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the later there are 2: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCONTRIB/component/10851  \n16:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: we are talking about Livetable Excel Export Macro  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems whoever developed it didn't follow any process....  \n16:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yepp  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at least they were not using jira)  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why do we care?  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are they ok to change that?  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do they want that?  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they don't have to use jira, it's their choice  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we shouldn't force them if they don't want  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in this case we can simply remove the component and versions in XCONTRIB  \n16:39\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the problem is that it was first released on maven (using SCM) starting with 1.6. So versions < 1.6 are only xars attached to the page  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see it's Anca and GD who developed it  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so lucaa/gdelhumeau: what's your choice?  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0continue withour jira or start using jira?  \n16:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0We can start using JIRA, it seems to be a good idea  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: ok?  \n16:42\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I don't understand what is the question. if I want jira for livetable excel export  \n16:42\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0?  \n16:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0lucaa: I want to report a bug but I can't because I don't have the affected Version in JIRA  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: so far it seems GD and you haven't been using the jira project for the dev of this extension  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is ok. I can create a jira project for it but there's no point if you don't want to use it  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: that's not a problem  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for extensions without jira you can comment on the extension page  \n16:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I don't have any development planned for this extension. So I really don't have any strong opinion about this  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ofc jira is nicer IMO but that's the choice of the project owner/developers)  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(BTW I'd also like that we improve the repository app so that it displays the link to the Issue tracker on e.x.o)  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9682 for that)  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wrong title  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Add the notion of Issue Tracker to XWiki Extensions\"  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so sburjan/gdelhumeau/lucaa: let me know if you want me to create a jira project for the excel export macro, whcih means using it from now on  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ANN: groovy 2.2 release: http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/groovy-2-2-released  \n17:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:42\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n18:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:31\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n19:13\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:22\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:59\u00a0<Kais3n>\u00a0has quit  \n20:14\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:27\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:55\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:38\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n23:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
