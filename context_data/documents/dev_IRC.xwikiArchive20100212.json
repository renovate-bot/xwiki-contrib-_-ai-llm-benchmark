 \nlucaa - (12:21): (I don't understand...)  \nvmassol - (12:22): because you wouldn't have a pb with EntityType  \ntmortagne - (12:22): wasn't the fact that you get redirected to the administration home page when you delete an attachment in import page supposed to be fixed ?

 \nsdumitriu - (15:02): OK  \nsdumitriu - (15:02): Nothing important would be gone  \nsdumitriu - (15:02): Users can re-register if they want  \nvmassol - (15:02): yes  \nvmassol - (15:03): the irc spam is starting  \nvmassol - (15:04): a single delete is really long  \nsdumitriu - (15:04): Yes, what takes much is saving XWikiAllGroup  \nvmassol - (15:04): we should check what the pb is  \nsdumitriu - (15:04): Since object load/save is inefficient  \nvmassol - (15:04): ok  \nvmassol - (15:04): I could stop the bot  \nvmassol - (15:05): anyone wants to stop the bot?  \nsdumitriu - (15:05): One query for each property  \nsdumitriu - (15:05): It's not a problem for me  \nvmassol - (15:05): the good part is that since it's long, the bot won't be ejected for flooding ;)  \nsdumitriu - (15:06): It won't, anyway  \nsdumitriu - (15:06): Since it's registered  \nsdumitriu - (15:06): (at least it used to be when I last worked on it)  \nsdumitriu - (15:08): vmassol: I think Caleb started a patch for the object performance  \nvmassol - (15:08): sdumitriu: I think so too  \nsdumitriu - (15:08): Let's see if the save time goes down after deleting all the users  \narkub left at 15:10 (Quit: Leaving  \nvmassol - (15:10): hmm this seems to be impacting xwiki.org quite a lot  \nvmassol - (15:11): it's very slow for me now  \narkub joined #xwiki at 15:12  \nglerouge - (15:12): quitting: excess fl00d in the chat  \nglerouge left #xwiki at 15:12  \ntmortagne - (15:12): we should really make XWikiAllGroup fully virtual by default some day...  \nsdumitriu - (15:13): I don't think it can be done on xwiki.org  \nflaviusolaru left at 15:13 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsdumitriu - (15:13): It should be upgraded first  \nsdumitriu - (15:13): But yes, it can be done already, just that it isn't so by default  \ntmortagne - (15:14): sdumitriu: even with last version it's still not fully virtual by default  \narkub left at 15:15 (Read error: No route to host  \ntmortagne - (15:15): we should not even provide the XWikiAllGroup document and have it in a special part of the rights management UI like with guest user  \narkub joined #xwiki at 15:15  \narkub left at 15:15 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \narkub joined #xwiki at 15:15  \nvmassol - (15:22): if anyone wants me to disconnect the irc bot momentarily please let me know  \nvmassol - (15:28): tmortagne: I see in the myxwiki.org logs this:  \nvmassol - (15:28): 2010-02-12 14:27:50,168 [http://cdi.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/BlogRss?xpage=rdf] WARN \u00a0doc.XWikiDocument \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Failed to find parser for syntax [2].

 \nvmassol - (15:36): tmortagne: indeed they have put \"2\"....  \nvmassol - (15:36): I was worried we had a bug but it's only a user pb, cool :)  \ntmortagne - (15:36): because currently the way it's done a list of properties from the XWikiPreferences object to show it given to the UI in this section  \ntmortagne - (15:36): sdumitriu:  \ntmortagne - (15:37): i did not said a big refactoring ;)  \ntmortagne - (15:38): it's like talking in the wind :)  \nsdumitriu - (15:40): tmortagne: For the moment it could be a StaticList  \nsdumitriu - (15:40): It's not dynamic, but it covers most frequent usecases  \ntmortagne - (15:40): sdumitriu: i don't like this, it make impossible to support another parser that someone would add  \nsdumitriu - (15:41): Yes it does, just edit the class  \ntmortagne - (15:41): if we do this that way it will remains like this a long time  \nsdumitriu - (15:41): Do you prefer to have a free input where a user can make a lot of mistakes, or a static list that an admin must update once?  \ntmortagne - (15:43): sdumitriu: i prefer we make the admin UI able to use dynamic datas instead of just a list of field form preferences object  \ntmortagne - (15:48): vmassol: another solution is to add a DocumentSyntaxClass (PropertyClass) like we have the UsersClass  \ntmortagne - (15:48): was for sdumitriu actually  \nsdumitriu - (15:49): tmortagne: Yes, that was my initial thought  \nsdumitriu - (15:49): But looks like too much overhead  \nsdumitriu - (15:49): It's a new data type used in only one place  \nsdumitriu - (15:50): tmortagne: Look at XWIKI-160  \ntmortagne - (15:52): sdumitriu: you say in a comment that we have \"support for using velocity/groovy scripts in the hql\", how do you do that ?  \ntmortagne - (15:52): anyway indeed XWIKI-160 seems the right way  \nsdumitriu - (15:53): tmortagne: It's not about using only velocity to compute the result  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): Just that the query is first parsed, so that things like $doc.fullName is interpreted  \ntmortagne - (15:55): in DBList ?
