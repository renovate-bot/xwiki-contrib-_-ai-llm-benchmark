Where would I report this?  \n20:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0jira.xwiki.org is the place to report bugs.  \n20:01\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0@cjdelisle was this to me?  \n20:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yes, let me get you a link to some information about script services.  \n20:06\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0the problem is that removing a user from a group doesn't seem to work. I'll wait till I can reproduce it in trunk thoug.  \n20:06\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0h  \n20:06\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0or my snap of trunk  \n20:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm that sounds pretty serious  \n20:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0mbryant: Here's an example https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-crypto/src/main/java/org/xwiki/crypto/internal/scripting/CryptoScriptService.java  \n20:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You add a component which implements ScriptService and the @Component() \"hint\" is the name which it will have. So where that is @Component(\"crypto\") it is accessable as $services.crypto  \n20:10\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0and you can access that from a velocity script so any calls which you need to make into your code can be done right through that interface.  \n20:12\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0right i know, that, and am already doing that, but I am needing to build a page inside of java code, much like a logger for events. basicaly I have a service sending a restful message to my component, and I need to take the data given by that service, and create a page, with an object on it (in java) because of specific parsing and calculations i need to do. and then use the xwiki api java calls,  \n20:12\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0to create the page. its those api calls that I am looking for  \n20:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I would make java code return the some type of data like a hashmap or arraylist which is then manipulated in velocity to make the page. Actually writing html in java usually turns out to be a mistake.  \n20:14\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0in essence i want to create a page and object without using the gui system to do it  \n20:14\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0and can i have the page create it automatically? everytime i get a ping?  \n20:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0gui? you mean without going through xwiki?  \n20:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't follow  \n20:15\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0okay, so it is not going to be a \"user\" created page persay, its more like a bot publishing events  \n20:17\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0sorry net problems... I am basically building a component (bot) that will create pages to report specific events that my users will be able to see and analyize.  \n20:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ok so you have to decide if you want to store the events in the database every time you get new information or if you want to store events in the bot and then render them when the user loads the page.  \n20:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Also you might want to take a look at how the IRC bot works, it saves the page with the log every time someone types a line into this channel.  \n20:20\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0it is deff the first one, everytime there is new infomration passed to my bot, I want to create a new independent page with that information  \n20:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I see, then you want to go the other way around, you want to get at the XWiki api from your bot.  \n20:22\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0right.  \n20:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the easiest way to do this IMO is to get the XWiki object and use the regular get/save document api functiond  \n20:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*functions  \n20:24\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0can you point me to the API for these by chance?  \n20:25\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0i figured it was a pretty easy thing to do, I just couldnt find the right APIs to get it done and that is basically what I was looking for  \n20:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm there's a way but it only works in the context of a request.  \n20:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So if someone goes to a page to start the bot then the page request will work, otherwise it won't.  \n20:29\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0thats less than ideal but doable, if it remains active as long as xwiki is active. (if xwiki is restarted, i understand that i might have to got to a page and click a button)  \n20:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm sure there are other ways to get it to work but this is the one on the top of my head right now.  \n20:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-plugins/tags/xwiki-plugin-skinx-1.21/src/main/java/org/xwiki/skinx/AbstractWrapperSkinExtension.java  \n20:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That gets hold of the XWiki object which is the center of the old core.  \n20:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It has all of the functions you are familiar with such as getDocument()  \n20:33\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0if it helps, we are on 3.1  \n20:34\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yup, this has all been the same since 1.x  \n20:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0once you have the com.xpn.xwiki.XWiki object and com.xpn.xwiki.XWikiContext objects, you can make the com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki object that you are familiar with.  \n20:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki xwiki = new com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki(context.getWiki(), context);  \n20:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that will make you an \"xwiki\" object just like the one you are familiar with in velocity and groovy scripting.  \n20:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You see the line that you're interested in in the link I pasted?  \n20:38\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0XWikiContext xwikiContext = (XWikiContext) execution.getContext().getProperty(\"xwikicontext\"); ?  \n20:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yup that's the one  \n20:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0beware: there are 2 XWiki classes, one is internal and we might break things in it at any time, the other is the one which is described in the scripting documentation.  \n20:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0you want com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki  \n20:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0but context.getWiki() will give you the internal one.  \n20:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hence:  \n20:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki xwiki = new com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki(context.getWiki(), context);  \n20:43\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0has quit  \n20:44\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:44\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0>.< sorry again did you get my last question?  \n20:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0nope  \n20:44\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0well, we are basically baselining right now on 3.1 and we will cross that bridge when we get to it.. \u00a0and thats nice, so the user will have to visit a page (and on visit) it sets the context? and then my service will be able to publish? I am just trying to understand the workflow now.  \n20:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yes, it would put the context into a thread local map where it can be accessed through the Execution.  \n20:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But it could call itself easily enough, you could cheat and use commons HttpClient or dig through the code and try to make a context without having a request to begin with.  \n20:49\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0i like cheating.. so use the xwiki commons httpclient context to set mine, and then build the api object from that? \u00a0then i can pragmaticaly creat independent pages, with objects, and publish (save) them. \u00a0Do i pretty much have that right?  \n20:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Nope, it's apache commons HttpClient. it's pretty well documented and it's already included in XWiki do all you need to do is pull it in with include statements.  \n20:52\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0right, thats what you use for your restful interface.  \n20:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yup, just fire up a page with that, you will end up with a different thread where you can get the Xiki object from but it should even be possible to hand the object across threads and let the other one end (I'm not entirely sure on that)  \n20:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:58\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0thanks for your help, I am sure that I will have more questions but this should be enough to get me started, and the largest part i see thats going to be the biggest concern for me, is creating the context object, Not as familiar with context as I would like to be but I work with enough smart people to be able to get it solved, thanks for your help  \n20:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0sure thing  \n21:01\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:04\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:05\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:05\u00a0<mbryant2>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:48\u00a0<qwebirc17586>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n22:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:17\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
