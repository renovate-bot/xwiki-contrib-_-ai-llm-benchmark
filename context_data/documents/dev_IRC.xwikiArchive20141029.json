How can I verify (in a crypto sense) XWiki downloads?  \n10:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0what is the threat model?  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0man in the middle?  \n10:49\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0Yes, MITM.  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have hashes in maven repo  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for exazmple http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb/6.2.3/  \n10:49\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0Would that require me to build XWiki instead of getting a binary?  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb/6.2.3/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-6.2.3.pom.asc  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can compare the download you get with this  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb/6.2.3/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-6.2.3.pom.sha1  \n10:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeap, that sounds like a good approach, sha1 it and compare to the hash because unless the man in the middle is extremely clever and persistent, he won't change the hash as well  \n10:50\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0Hm, it doesn't seem to support HTTPS though.  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we're moving the whole xwiki.org to https but it's not done yet  \n10:50\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0I know it's sort of unlikely, but I kinda make it a rule to verify my downloads.  \n10:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0bad tor exit --> switch tor exits and download twice...  \n10:51\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0Well, it would be enough to get a fingerprint for the signing key.  \n10:51\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0Securely, again. :)  \n10:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0what's the threat model  \n10:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if you're worried about the nsa, don't worry, they're inside your intel chip <3  \n10:52\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0no https support? MITM fixed your hashes too  \n10:52\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0MiTM, and the reason I'm adamant about it is it's cheap and easy to enforce a practically insurmontable barrier.  \n10:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0practically insurmontable \u00a0<-- pwning a CA costs about 100k\u20ac \u00a0getting a certificate to anything you want costs less, usually you can just social engineer one  \n10:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0https://www.sslshopper.com/article-ssl-certificate-for-mozilla.com-issued-without-validation.html  \n10:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0eg  \n10:55\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0So it's not just that \"we don't implement https because it sucks anyway\" but \"huh, crypto? What's that?\"  \n10:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n10:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0won't argue w/ you there, but if the objective is to complain that xwiki.org doesn't have an ssl cert, open in issue  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki sas who is hosting all servers for the xwiki.org project has bought the CAs already, some papers are on their way and then they'll do the swtich to https  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no need  \n10:56\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0Ok, I will. In the meanwhile I'll try fetching a package from a distro.  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to open anything  \n10:57\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0Ah.  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's on its way already  \n10:58\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0One thing I'd do if I didn't have certs is publish the signing key on github and other few places.  \n10:58\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0In effect, you get github to be a CA of sorts.  \n10:59\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0(since they give you https)  \n11:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sorry for being confrontational about the security stuff, I just spend quite a bit of time thinking about risk and I find that one of the biggest impediments to real security is that instead of trying to visualize the threats that they don't know, people spend way too much time trying to lock down whatever vulns they do know of, regardless of whether the threat is realistic  \n11:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n11:04\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:05\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0The threat model is probably unrealistic, yeah, but plugging the hole is also incredibly cheap.  \n11:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n11:08\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0Are you aware of any distro that packages XWiki? I could only find an Arch PKGBUILD so far.  \n11:10\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0I should google for the exact hashes in that maven repo.  \n11:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0download the .zip, sha1 it, google the sha1  \n11:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0;)  \n11:10\u00a0<yaronr>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:10\u00a0<yaronr>\u00a0Hi  \n11:11\u00a0<yaronr>\u00a0I would like to install xwiki + tomcat with an existing MySQL  \n11:11\u00a0<yaronr>\u00a0I saw 'xwiki-enterprise-tomcat-common'  \n11:11\u00a0<yaronr>\u00a0But I'm looking for a more detailed tutorial  \n11:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationTomcat  \n11:13\u00a0<yaronr>\u00a0cjd thanks.

 \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why should we care it's about bootswatch?  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and shouldn't we have theme as themes in flamingo-theme?  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(along with the default flamingo theme)  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Charcoal)  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we copied them from bootswatch they're now our themes  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it also mean that in the UI you plan to have a \"bootswtach\" category when listing all the themes?  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I don't think it makes sense)  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW I don't understand why we have http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/FlamingoColorTheme  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since Charcoal is in the \"Flamingo Theme Application\" extension  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Flamingo+Theme+Application doesn't even show Charcoal  \n17:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have created a separated application because:  \n17:52\u00a0<Eduard\\_Munteanu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0- as a \"tribute\" to bootswatch  \n17:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0- because they aer a bit special: they use the 'lessCode' field and are not easy to customize. See: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Bootswatch+Themes+for+Flamingo  \n17:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I also would like to create new themes, but basic ones that does not use the lessCode field  \n17:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0just to show how to have different themes using the basic technology  \n17:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and these themes would be along Charcoal, on the Flamingo Theme App  \n17:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0BTW I wonder if I should set \"(from Bootswatch)\" on the title of these themes.

This one instance is (still) Xwiki 1.0  \n19:05\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0it was let loose years ago  \n19:05\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0and was already 9GB big (almost instantly)  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's a nice challenge :)  \n19:06\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0yes. it's ridiculous  \n19:06\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0the full backup now is 32GB  \n19:06\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0and most of that is attachment archives  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be an interesting upgrade  \n19:06\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0because.. well. they are all in the DB!  \n19:06\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is this a business project where there would be a budget to perform this upgrade?

I know this is moldy oldy code that no one remembers  \n19:15\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0but what do you reckon  \n19:16\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0if I purge the archive (which is HUGE).. would that hurt?  \n19:16\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0I want to keep the current versions of attachments..  \n19:16\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0but I don't think anyone will fall over if the old ones go away  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok got it  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was looking at existing snippets on extensions.xwiki.org  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to see if we have one for removing archives  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I cannot find one that does just that  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know too well this part of the code  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you have a backup then try it out ;)  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should work I think  \n19:18\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0schema is here btw: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/DatabaseSchema  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since nothing points to attachment\\_archive it should be ok I guess  \n19:21\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0y. that was my thought  \n19:27\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0I'll do the next backup differently  \n19:27\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0so that one is sitting all alone, and then ditch it  \n19:27\u00a0<ebullient>\u00a0\\*headache\\*  \n19:31\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:35\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:53\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:58\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:20\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:22\u00a0<yaronr>\u00a0has quit  \n20:44\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:45\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n22:45\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n23:55\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit\n"}
