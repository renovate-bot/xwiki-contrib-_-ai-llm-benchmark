Is it an administrative task?  \nsdumitriu - (10:34): Yes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:34): Would you mind putting my address on it?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:56): Hmm, actually it might be a better idea to add the security list and get the list ops to put in a word filter so only the secret issues get sent.  \ntmortagne - (10:57): +1  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 10:58  \nabusenius - (11:14): good time of the day everyone  \nabusenius - (11:15): btw security list, is it working? am I on it? if not, do I need to do smth for that?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:16): Hmm. looks like you're an admin of the list ;) http://lists.xwiki.org/mailman/listinfo/security  \nabusenius - (11:18): no, thats another Alex :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:20): Ahh.

Is it documented?  \ntmortagne - (13:18): i don't think so  \ntmortagne - (13:18): should be in http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/ModelModule  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:19): I was able to getDocument the name and compare references but this is a steep learning curve.  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 13:23  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 13:24  \ntmortagne - (13:38): [myxwiki] I'm currently upgrading myxwiki.org to 2.4M1  \ntmortagne - (13:47): [myxwiki] Stopping myxwiki.org  \ntmortagne - (13:54): [myxwiki] Done  \nabusenius - (14:23): is there already something like login/logout events accessible from a component?  \ntmortagne - (14:24): abusenius: no (not that i know of)  \nsdumitriu - (14:25): abusenius: Hard to have those  \nabusenius - (14:25): I guess the authentication must be reimplemented as a component first?  \nsdumitriu - (14:25): You can just catch when a user explicitly uses the login logout form  \nsdumitriu - (14:25): Normally the cookies are checked each time, and cookies are there for a long time  \nsdumitriu - (14:26): So, how do you define a login?  \nabusenius - (14:26): well, authentication  \nabusenius - (14:26): user provided credentials = login  \ntmortagne - (14:28): abusenius: so make authenticator produce an event each time it's called ?  \nabusenius - (14:29): is the authenticator the only way a user can login?  \nabusenius - (14:29): in my case, I want to clear the cache with secret tokens when the user logs out  \nabusenius - (14:29): but I think this is a good idea also in general, other components might use it too  \ntmortagne - (14:31): login generally calls an authenticator so yes AFAIK when you log in you always call an authenticator at some point  \ntmortagne - (14:32): that's the easiest way i see to have login events, now for logout it probably not that simple  \nabusenius - (14:32): and logout too?  \ntmortagne - (14:32): problem is hat you don't always explicitely logout  \ntmortagne - (14:32): in fact most of the time you don't  \nabusenius - (14:32): true, cookies can just expiere  \nabusenius - (14:32): or you crash  \ntmortagne - (14:32): yep you can only have dome daemon thread doing checks  \ntmortagne - (14:33): s/dome/some/  \nabusenius - (14:33): maybe I should expire tokens too, this will keep the cache small too  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 14:57  \nsburjan left at 14:59 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:02): I'm going to commit some more test stuff, I changed some of the loginAndGotoPage methods to getURLToLoginAndGotoPage.  \nabusenius - (15:12): is there a standard way to fire some \"PeriodicEvent\" every couple of hours?  \narkub joined #xwiki at 15:12  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:13): I don't think there is a standard, doesn't sound too difficult though.  \ntmortagne - (15:13): abusenius: there is no timer events at component level but you can use scheduler plugin to call java code periodically  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:14): Going to commit tests for Invitation Application. They're @Ignored for now since Invitation is still sandboxed.  \ntmortagne - (15:14): jvdrean would know better  \njvdrean - (15:15): abusenius: yes, the scheduler plugin (Scheduler.WebHome) allows to create periodic jobs  \njvdrean - (15:16): those jobs can fire a groovy script or order the execution of an implementation of a quartz job present in the classpath  \nabusenius - (15:18): thx, hm.. just wondering whether this is a good way to be the main source of periodic events for a component  \nabusenius - (15:19): its not a script or optional application, but rather meant to be used everywhere  \njvdrean - (15:37): abusenius: the answer I think is that the scheduler plugin should be rewritten as a component  \nvmassol left at 15:38 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 15:44  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:49): Nap time.
