 \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't think of any  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless we're 100% sure the dep is never used outside of platforme  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0platform  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we can't really guarantee this  \n14:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I see... so theoretically the stuff in xwiki-platform-core should be moved to xwiki-commons  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: any take on this?  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not commons-pom  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0commons  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sorry, commons  \n14:50\u00a0<coud10>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the stuff in xwiki-platform-core is stuff we use only in platform  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in this case we are using it in commons too  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: sure but we cannot really guarantee this  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since we use reflections in commons  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why ?  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we know what we are using  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sure  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's harder to be sure  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex if we had a module in enterprise  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we would need to remember to check it  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/had/add  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now there are valid use cases for having different versions in different parts of xwiki  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not about things we add by default in XE IMO, as long as we use something in severl different module we should piut its version in a commons place  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could have a given version of guava for xeclipse  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's different from the version required by platform/xe  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this case there's no reason to put one version over another in the top level pom  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but xeclipse is different  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but this is true for all deps  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so in this case we're favorizing platform/xe  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0over other potential projects  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would also extend the top level pom  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think our top level pom is meant to be only platform/xe  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xeclipse can use whatever it want by redefining it  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc but as I said  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same for any project  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so in this case we're favorizing platform/xe  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and there's no reason  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from the pov of the top level pom itself  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0his role is not to be there jsut for platform/xe  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's to be there for all top level projects  \n14:56\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Is XWiki's WYSIWYG editor stable?  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0crocket: yes  \n14:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in this case it's not there only for platform, we need to put it in cmmons because we use that dep in both commons, rendering and platform  \n14:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if this dep was only oin platform we could not put it in commons  \n14:56\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0vmassol, Does it break contents when switching between wiki and WYSIWYG modes?  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0crocket: no  \n14:56\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0hmm.....  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why we wrote our own crocket, so that it's perfect ;)  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vs what you find in other wikis...  \n14:57\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0vmassol, your own what?

 \n15:03\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0yes  \n15:04\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0The latest version presents us with complex UI.  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what part you find the most complex?  \n15:05\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0the main page has too many components.  \n15:05\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I got confused.  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can edit it  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's your page  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can put whatever you want in it  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you're talking about skin then it's all pages, not just the main page  \n15:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: AFAIU, tmortagne agreed that commons was the place to put it :)  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah maybe because reflections is used in commons  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n15:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, reflections is actually managed in commons (the dep)  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as I said yes it's because reflections is used in commons  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and in rendering  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's very simple: the common place between all deps is commons in this case  \n15:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, thank you both  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I hope jenkins is not stuck  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems to take long to restart  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not responding for me)  \n15:09\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0vmassol, Is http://www.terracotta.org built using xwiki?

 \n15:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0fmancinelli: yeap  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fmancinelli: you need to get hold of the Environment component  \n15:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0just import java.io.File; and (the old way to do this is) Utils.getComponent(Environment.class), there's a new way but I don't know it off the top of my head  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: this is deprecated  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's services.component.  \n15:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I say old, you say deprecated, lets call the whole thing off (music)  \n15:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0services.component.getInstance(Environment.class) ?

 \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either that or deprecate getTemporaryDirect and introduce a getTemporaryResourceCreator (name to be improved) which itself has several methods: createTemporaryDirectory, create Temporary File, etc  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\\* @since 3.5M1  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Environment is 3.5M1  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0before that you had ApplicationContext I think  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:57\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0yes I read it... I meant, \"do you remember if in 3.1 there was a method for accessing the temporary directory?\"  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ApplicationContext.getTemporaryDirectory()  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and to get the app context you get it from the Container  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ComponentScriptService is 4.1M2 too  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Utils.getComponent(Container.class)  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0.getApplicationContext().getTemporaryDirectory()  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on one line:  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Utils.getComponent(Container.class).getApplicationContext().getTemporaryDirectory()  \n15:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Actually IMO we should scrap getTemporaryDirectory() and add #getTempDir() which returns a unique temp dir for each call.  \n15:59\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ok. thanks  \n16:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0since otherwise everyone needs an adhoc namespacing technique  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed, seems a good idea, (except for the name ;))  \n16:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0tempdir is universal, no need to write a book :)  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still think it's better to provide a general tool for temporary stuff  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on my machine it's tmp not tempdir  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's not universal  \n16:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0indeed, apple is not universal  \n16:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I ran into that problem with a cjdns build script  \n16:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0/tmp is pretty common  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a detail  \n16:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but dir is a universal word for directory and temp is a pretty well understood word for temporary  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0director?

 \n17:07\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Is there any good java CMS?  \n17:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but I bet you can come up with a good architecture for creating such a gallery  \n17:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0with XWiki  \n17:07\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0All CMSs that I consider good are in PHP.  \n17:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0there is noting stopping you from writing an application on top of XWiki that does it for you, allowing you to do whatever grouping of attachments you need  \n17:09\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, Does XWiki support virtual domains with PostgreSQL?

 \n17:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0depends on what you are asking :) HSQLDB is more of an embedded solution, while PostgreSQL is more of a server oriented solution, but then again, I did not work with Postgre, so I could not give you more details on it  \n17:29\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Although WYSIWYG is robust, its functionalities are not as powerful as CKEditor.  \n17:29\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0But then, moinmoin and tiki wiki have unstable CKEditor.  \n17:31\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, how do you think?
