 \n18:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in a velocity script  \n18:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0actually it's not syntax, it's a little velocity script  \n18:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ftm I'm using  \n18:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0$doc.getRenderedContent(\"{{velocity}}mylittlescript{{/velocity}}\")  \n18:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0are there any other ways to achieve this?  \n18:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0found it, rendering as plain/1.0 does the job, but I guess won't work if there's also a bit of wiki syntax in that script  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: hmm not sure anymore but we have an inline parser in some util class AFAIR  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(from java)  \n18:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I need it in velocity  \n18:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: if it's a velocity script and no syntax you should not use rendering framework IMO  \n18:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but how do I grab a velocity renderer?  \n18:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't remember but you can look at what velocity macro does  \n18:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I need all these in velocity  \n18:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0otrherwise I know how to grab a velocity renderer  \n18:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n18:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0isn't there a tool to evaludate velocity in velocity ?  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe velocity is not the right place  \n18:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or even an #evaluate macro or something like that  \n18:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking something  \n18:25\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: \u00a0it still wouldn't work fully because i need it in the context of a specific $doc  \n18:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha ok  \n18:25\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0however I think you can pass that too  \n18:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0problem is that to evaluate some velocity in teh context of another document you need programming right anyway unless you are the author of this other document  \n18:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: where does this script to evaluate come from ?  \n18:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0i'm in a .vm  \n18:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0how are those interpreted? do I still need programming rights?  \n18:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I just want to allow velocity in the names of templates for the template providers, for the creation of a page from template  \n18:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0.vm is working like you script was in the current document AFAIK  \n18:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and you need to evaluate the script in the context of which document ? the template ?  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: do you still have build issues because I've just fully rebuilt everything up to XE and it worked well  \n18:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/templaate/template document/  \n18:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the template provider  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0( vmassol lemme check )  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/ hasn't fully rebuilt everything yet though  \n18:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: I think there is a type of property representing velocity content without syntax  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0kicking it  \n18:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in that case you just need to call object.get  \n18:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checkingg  \n18:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: still failing only the enterprise.

I would so prefer not having to change the prop type  \n18:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0to not migrate  \n18:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and I think I want it as an input  \n18:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0not textarea  \n18:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0all these because i need to translate this title  \n18:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I think we should somehow add a mechanism for this  \n18:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0easily translatable properties  \n18:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0automatically I mean  \n18:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what do you mean by translate ?  \n18:35\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0property values  \n18:35\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean localize  \n18:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0don't see what this had to do with velocity  \n18:35\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0allow i18n  \n18:35\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0$msg,get :)  \n18:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so what you want is not really executing velocity then ?  \n18:35\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0no  \n18:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n18:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what you could do is expecting the property is maybe a translation key  \n18:36\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0however, we don't have a mechanism to check  \n18:36\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0if a translation is successfull or not  \n18:36\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0or do we?  \n18:36\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0we do... I think...  \n18:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and even if it's not a translation key the you will get it unchanged  \n18:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0no you don  \n18:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0don't  \n18:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0you get the $msg,get  \n18:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0if it doesn't exist  \n18:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think so no  \n18:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0which makes me think  \n18:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0pretty sure it return the kay  \n18:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it means $msg.get returns null...  \n18:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0lemme verify  \n18:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it should not  \n18:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it wasn't last time i checked  \n18:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and even if it was returning null then it would ben even easier to know of that's a translation key  \n18:38\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes, true  \n18:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand why http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/116/console happens.
