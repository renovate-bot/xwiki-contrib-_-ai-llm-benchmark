But I can't install in the extension manager  \n10:19\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/q2s7R34a  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: on which version of XWiki did you try ?  \n10:19\u00a0<fitz>\u00a08.0  \n10:19\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-8.0  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should try 8.1 or 7.4.3, what you get is a bug I fixed not long ago  \n10:20\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n10:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: so I recreated my XWiki account and it worked this time !  \n10:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0great work  \n10:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would need some error reporting now :)  \n10:33\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:37\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0tmortagne, Maybe I can use Google Analytics SDK to collect errors, exception and crash!  \n10:37\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0I will update it in the next version!  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: by the way you should link to http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Android+authenticator/ in https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/android-authenticator since you moved the documentation there  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0another question, how do you do a release ?  \n10:50\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0tmortagne, now I just generate a key by myself and use it to sign the apk with android studio.  \n10:51\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0maybe i should use the gradle script to automatically release the app  \n10:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: yep that's what I wanted to talk about :)  \n10:52\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0you know, now it's just an alpha version.  \n10:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now w=one of the issue is that there is no tag corresponding to what you call a release among other things, now for the signing part I don't know but at least for generating the apk it would be nicer  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I know but it's better to look at those thing early  \n10:54\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0and i don't know where to put the key file int the jenkins ? and how to ensure the security if I put the key file in my github repository ?  \n10:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jenkins is for snapshots, not releases  \n10:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now for the key it depends what exactly is a key  \n10:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is it a file you get from the play store for this application ? is this associated to your dev account ?  \n10:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's something related to you then each dev that do release will imply use his own key  \n10:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it's a matter of how the release script can be configured to use this key, probably in some configuration file in your user home  \n10:57\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0yes, but about how to automatically release? \u00a0I will explore ASAP.  \n10:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example we sign artifact with our own key when we release XWiki  \n10:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and the gpg key is set in the maven settings.xml  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: I would say it's a bonus  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now I'm mostly interesting is getting proper handmade releases  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure we really need it to be fully automated but that's your project :)  \n11:01\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html  \n11:03\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0I just generated a jks key file, sign the app with android studio and upload it to the google play console. that's all.  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"you will need to sign your APKs \u00a0\u00a0with the same certificate throughout the lifespan of your app\" hmm so all dev must use the same key  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so will need to find a secure way for all future release managers of the application to access this key  \n11:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n11:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n11:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/signing-open-source-android-apps-without-disclosing-passwords looks interesting on this subject  \n11:12\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0tmortagne, maybe we'd better generate a new private key! \u00a0I just created the key for test version now. :)  \n11:12\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0and the key file contains many important information.  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean personal information about you and it would be better to generate a XWiki project oriented key ?  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case we need to have the key we want to use in the future ASAP  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it's possible to modify information attached to a key  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:25\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0yes it is! the security of cryptographic techniques is completely dependent on the key.  \n11:25\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0tmortagne, About the release, I will explore it later. thank you very much for your reminder :)  \n11:26\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: no problem, that's my job to bug you about annoying stuff ;)  \n11:28\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0has quit  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:45\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:52\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:01\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_6>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n12:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:09\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_6>\u00a01  \n12:47\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n13:07\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:07\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n13:15\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:18\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_6>\u00a0has quit  \n15:14\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n15:37\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:29\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: do we have a component in xwiki to get data from a URL using httpcommons?  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think so no, we directly use http client when we need to usually  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well there is a http client factory for repository handlers but that's all  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so nothing I can reuse  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll just use it directly then for now  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends what you cant to do exactly  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is a lot of tools like this in commons-io  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0things like FileUtils.copyURLToFile for example  \n16:46\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's for the jira macro  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm currently getting the jira url xml with:  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0createSAXBuilder().build(new URL(\u2026))  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I've just realized that this doesn't follow redirects  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example on a jira server I'm testing with, http;// is redirected to https://  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I was planning to replace this code wiht httpcommons  \n16:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea I doubt FileUtils.copyURLToFile follow redirects, you will need a \"real\" http client  \n16:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but does not it means you are using the wrong URL in the first place if you are redirected ?  \n16:55\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's still better to support redirects  \n16:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got a user of the jira macro who didn't undestand that  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the secure jira macro does support redirects...  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the secure jira macro uses groovy parseText(url)\u2026 whicch apparently supports directect  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since that user is moving from that macro to the official jira macro he didn't understand...  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another point  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forget that  \n17:16\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:20\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0Hi, in groovy i've saved a var as xcontext.put(\"myVar\",myValue), after that i'm making a response.sendRedirect(docUrl). is my Var will exist in the xcontext after redirection ?  \n17:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I do not think so, the context is bound to the current request (usually)  \n17:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if \"myValue\" is a string, you could try to save it in the session  \n17:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, I mean: in the session as cookie, but that is nonsense  \n17:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can store it in the session as attribute, no matter what datatype, sorry  \n17:25\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0as request.getSession().setAttribute(\"myVar\", myValue) you mean  \n17:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes!  \n17:26\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok, i will try that, thanks !  \n17:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can remove it from the session on the page after the redirect, that should minify any confusion if the user has several tabs open browsing the same wiki  \n17:28\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0noticed ;)  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ol-ow2: I confirm that context is tied to the request so you need to use either the session or the cookie  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or put what you want as parameter of the redirect URL  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends how safe this information is  \n17:33\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i understand  \n17:33\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0thx  \n17:34\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0great support, thanks to be here :)  \n17:36\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0our pleasure :)  \n17:53\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:01\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:33\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n19:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n20:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:06\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n20:55\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n21:15\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:46\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:09\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:53\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit\n"}
