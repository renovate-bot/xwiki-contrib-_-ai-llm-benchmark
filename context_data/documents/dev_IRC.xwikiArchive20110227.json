I stil don't know why annotations (including annotations tab) is injected  \n04:08\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0using js  \n04:09\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but afaik PR is checked against velocity and groovy .. so you can't do dangerous scripting with it  \n04:23\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n06:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n06:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:40\u00a0<xipe>\u00a0has quit  \n07:41\u00a0<xipe>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0alternative to velocity for us (we could provide it): http://scalate.fusesource.org/  \n09:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That's interesting.

I added a throw->catch->printStackTrace to the dropPermissions line and it is printing that when running the test.  \n11:30\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0cjdelisle: who did you ban ?  \n11:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0spammer  \n11:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0malware spam woohoo  \n11:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm pretty clever one too. spammed #bittorrent too and still not klined.  \n11:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0note to self. 200MB insert statements are bad  \n11:50\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\u00a0#set ($xcontext.tocData = $tocData)  \n12:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0umm... what doe sit do?  \n12:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It seems there are a number pf places where c.x.x.api.Context.get is used in the templates which ofc requires PR or returns null.  \n12:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: did you see XAANNOTATIONS-46 ?  \n12:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes and I am working on it now.  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice :)  \n12:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I have enabled logging of PR checks and turned up a bunch of problems in the templates.  \n12:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I am writing mail now to propose deprecating the $context.something pattern since if there is no $context.getSomething() it defaults to $context.get('something') and that checks PR and returns null of no pr is present.  \n12:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0AKA no error checking, \"once in a while bugs\" since when there is PR a line which usually works ok having null suddenly has an object which it cannot handle.  \n12:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0+ I can fix all of the current issues right away using sed ;)  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:46\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:18\u00a0<nuvolari>\u00a0has quit  \n15:19\u00a0<nuvolari>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:22\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:25\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n15:25\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:31\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0guys I'm going to start the rendering move\u2026 build will be broken for some time  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0hmmm svn errors in committing\u2026. need to find out why\u2026  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0jvelociter: any idea why wikimanager seems not enabled on xwiki.org?
