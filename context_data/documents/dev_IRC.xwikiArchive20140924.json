The UI says \"promote\" on nexus. I don't see any \"validate\" button  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a \"Release\" one though  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who could work on XWIKI-11057?  \n15:32\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be good to have for 6.2.1  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: when are you planning to fix webstandards btw ? :)  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: that's because on nexus you should not use the promote button so talking about promote in the documentation was not making this veru obvious..  \n15:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: 6.3  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's close, then release, not promote  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: be careful not to push it to the last moment though  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a06.3M1 would be good  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don' tknow the full list of other issues you have on your plate  \n15:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0about http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-6.2.x/lastBuild/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/testReport/org.xwiki.test.ui.invitation/InvitationTest/testDeclineInvitation/  \n15:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the issue is that the guest user is redirected to the login form  \n15:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0instead of seing the desired page  \n15:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it sounds quite normal since there is a right object on the page, that sets \"view\" for \"AllGroup\"  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean we've fixed some permission bug?  \n15:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, those invitation tests are fixed from the POV of my javascript PO modifications.
