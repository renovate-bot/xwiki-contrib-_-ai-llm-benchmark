I would have to say that IBM SUCKS! \u00a0\u00a0Removing their suggestion allowed it to work... \u00a0It's working now. \u00a0Sorry.  \nasyd - (19/12/2008 14:09): :)  \nMadOtis - (19/12/2008 14:23): ok, next step I can't get past... \u00a0Trying to log in so I can install the basic set of pages (XAR file)... \u00a0Trying to log in using 'Admin' pwd: 'admin' says \"Wrong user name\"... \u00a0Has it changed from what it says in the instructions?  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:24): MadOtis: depends what you have in your wiki. If you don't have the Admin user installed it won't workl  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:24): s/workl/work/  \nMadOtis - (19/12/2008 14:24): vmassol: I installed just the stand-alone WAR file... IIRC: xwiki-enterprise-1.7.war  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:24): then you have an empty wiki  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:25): and you don't need to log in at all to do the import  \nMadOtis - (19/12/2008 14:25): oh, ok.  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:25): just import the enterprise XAR and you'll be fine  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:25): at that page the Admin user will get imported btw  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:25): s/page/point/  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:25): bascially with an empty wiki there's no rights set  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:26): and you get the rights when you import the rights page from the XAR  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:26): s/page/pages/  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 14:26): like XWikiAllGroup, XWikiGroups, etc  \nMadOtis - (19/12/2008 14:27): Ah... ok... importing it now. \u00a0Thank you.  \nxwikibot - (19/12/2008 14:42): Design.RestfulAPI was modified by xwiki:XWiki.fmancinelli - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/RestfulAPI  \nxwikibot - (19/12/2008 16:11): Design.ApplicationManager was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/ApplicationManager  \nxwikibot - (19/12/2008 16:33): Design.ApplicationManager was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/ApplicationManager  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:47): jvdrean: I'm trying to make the history/information tab at bottom of page not visible  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 16:47): yep  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:47): so I have created a showhistory property in XWikiPreferences  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:47): and set it to false  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:47): but it's not taken into account  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:47): any idea?  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:47): this is for my blog  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:48): not for XE :)  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 16:49): #set($showhistory = \"no\")  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:49): this is for a single page  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:49): I want this to be not visible for the whole wiki  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:50): (jvdrean)  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 16:50): ok in the prefs it's showhistory  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 16:50): too  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:50): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#set($showhistory = $xwiki.getWebPreference(\"showhistory\"))  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:50): from docextras.vm  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:51): what am I doing wrong?  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 16:51): nothing apparently  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 16:51): I have a doubt, getWebPreference looks at the wiki prefs if the web pref is empty right ?  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 16:52): yep that's what it does  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:56): jvdrean: could it be that showhistory is defined somewhere beofre?  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 16:57): vmassol: I'll have a look directly in your wiki  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 16:57): ok thanks  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:02): vmassol: do you remember having been able to disable the footer from the prefs with the old footer ?  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:02): because AFAICS the test that I copied is wrong  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:03): jvdrean: no, I've never done that  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:03): it tests getWebPreference() against \"no\" when the boolean prop returns 0 or 1  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:03): so today to get it work you have to create a string prop and put no in it  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:04): oh I see  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:04): I can fix it with testing for both no or 0, wdyt?  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:05): s/with/by/  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:05): (jvdrean)  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:06): rationale: if we replace \"no\" by 0 then we're going to break all people using #set to \"no\" in their pages  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:06): I've fixed it on you wiki by creating a string prop for showhistory  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:06): so using a string is the right way to do it you think?  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:06): (rather than a boolean)  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:06): I'm talking about XE   \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:07): (thanks for fixing it on my wiki\u00e0)  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:07): yes it's the right way  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:07): even if it would feel cleaner to have a boolean everywhere for this  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:07): then you agree with me  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:08): I think  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:08): yes  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:08): that we should test for both \"'no\" (deprecated) and 0  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:08): right?  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:08): yes  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:08): ok I'll fix this then  \nxwikibot - (19/12/2008 17:12): Design.RestfulAPI was modified by xwiki:XWiki.fmancinelli - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/RestfulAPI  \nvmassol - (19/12/2008 17:15): jvdrean: actually I need to test for \"0\", false and \"no\"  \njvdrean - (19/12/2008 17:15): right  \nxwikibot - (19/12/2008 20:58): XWiki.GradualStudent was modified by XWiki.GradualStudent (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/GradualStudent  \n\n"}
