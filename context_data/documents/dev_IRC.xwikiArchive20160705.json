 \n10:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(which are the current 2 features and reasons why we use the image macro on xwiki.org)  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: basically the person who created this issue wanted the same look at wikipedia  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and this includes border  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the solution to also add caption is most likely similar to the one to add border  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either a macro or some parameters  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that the issue with parameter is that it's too complex and lengthy to use  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(lenghty and complex)  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for xwiki.org for ex we want it by default  \n10:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0[[image:test.png|caption=\"My caption\"]]  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it could be the notion of default parameters configured in the admin for ex  \n10:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0or \"title\"  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or macro  \n10:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I don`t really see this as something coming from a macro  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically there are 3 characteristics we would need: caption, border and resize  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could be a style parameter maybe  \n10:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends what is the goal, there is a looot more stuff in mediawiki images :)  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[[image:test.png|style=small]] which would do both border + resize to a fixed small size  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with a confiurable style in the admin  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on xwiki.org we hve defined 3-4 styles  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a04  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DocGuide#HScreenshots2FImages  \n10:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we can already control the size through the width & height parameters (that also accept percentages)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but odon't understand  \n10:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we just need to add a title and a link parameter  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the goal is to be 1) simple and 2) consistent throughout the site  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you leave it to the user you get 1000 different styles  \n10:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if you add a macro, nobody will use it  \n10:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0they will use the standard, documented syntax  \n10:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0as best as they can  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you offer 3 parameters to use it's going to be even worse  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we just need good defaults  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nobody will us ethe  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*use them  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or they'll use them with wrong values  \n10:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0link can be default  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why I was mentioning defaults but you can't have defaults  \n10:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m primarily interested in a solution for the product here  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because as mentioned already we have 4 valid styles for xwiki.org  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you can imagine that by default we may not want all images to have the same size  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0border could be a default  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0linking too could be a default (when the image is resized)  \n10:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0linking should be done always (IMO, not just when resized)  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would you want to click on an image?  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when it displays the same thing)  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your browser already has an action to open the image  \n10:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I want all images to be clickable so that they can be opened in a new tab and easily referenced  \n10:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I don`t want it to open it in the current tab  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your browser already has an action to get the link to an image  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only reason I see for the linking is when the image is resized  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or when there's a link to another place ofc  \n10:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I like to keep it simple  \n10:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I find it more flexible that way  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[[[[image:\u2026]]>>...]]  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this case we don't want the autolink btw ;)  \n10:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, we also introduce this confusion  \n10:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0users might expect to go somewhere  \n10:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: what's up with http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/HallOfFame ? I don't appear in any of the categories and also the colors are off + there are very few contributors. Clemens also is missing, etc.  \n10:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0HallOfFame is outdated since a long time  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes there are issues with the version there I think. I had been working on the next version in github but it's not been fully finished/deployed AFAIR  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could be something to do during a hackathon for example ;)  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll update the page with a wanring for now  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it can be fixed easily by deleting the scm data in the perm dir to recreate them  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but would need some time for this  \n10:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Hello.

Confluence offers a way to add fields to each page (e.g. in a table) and then display a list of pages and selected fields from subpages. I'd like to create an inventory of stuff and put each item on a page.  \n12:12\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Similar to the \"References\" project. But I'd like to avoid coding. Just use what's available in xwiki.  \n12:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Signum: it's the main advantage of XWiki actually :)  \n12:13\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you should try http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/App+Within+Minutes+Application  \n12:13\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0gdelhumeau: Uh, nice.

I need to commit the configuration for the default WYSIWYG editor. It should be either in xwiki.properties or XWikiPreferences but since the value is going to be ckeditor it can't be committed in platform, which is not aware of the CKEditor (as we decided to have he dep in XE).  \n13:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so it needs to be committed on XE, but this would mean overwriting xwiki.properties or XWikiPreferences in XE  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we have default values for all properties  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is just about documenting the properties for the user  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed we would need overwriting in XE  \n13:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it doesn't apply in this case, because the platform code that defines the configuration option doesn't know about ckeditor  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember exazctly where we generate the file  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we have an extra config property  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$!xwikiPropertiesAdditionalProperties  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in the build)  \n13:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed  \n13:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we use it for tests  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go now (eval meeting), bb later but maybe others (thomas?) can help?  \n14:13\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: for me it's just about documenting this property and make the value configurable at build time like we do for several already (like we should probably do for all actually at some point)  \n14:13\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: but ckeditor should be the default editor in 8.2 and for this it needs to be explicitly configured. Having \"ckeditor\" as the default value doesn't work because the configuration source is in platform, which doesn't know about ckeditor. So XE must configure ckeditor explicitly  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: and that's exactly what I said  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XE would set it at build time  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same as various other properties  \n14:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, good  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it should be an actual property, documented and with a placeholder  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XE should not use $!xwikiPropertiesAdditionalProperties  \n14:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you mean a POM property?  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I means same as https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-tools/xwiki-platform-tool-configuration-resources/src/main/resources/xwiki.properties.vm#L87  \n14:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and then in XE you set a Maven property which is then used at platform level to generate the xwiki.properties file  \n14:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0thanks, I'll do the same  \n14:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0we were supposed to not commit  \n14:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0edvorg: you got mail ;)  \n15:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: so you will commit it today?
