Thanks for creating the repo !!!  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n13:47\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I have only one question: the thread \"[xwiki-devs] [VOTE] Modification to groupid for contrib projects\" is about the group ID from the pom.xml file, right ? It's not about the repo name, right ?  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correct  \n13:48\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0thanks.  \n13:48\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I'll make sure I follow the rule :)  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't have any rule yet for the repo name  \n14:11\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n14:12\u00a0<SvenDowideit\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:12\u00a0<SvenDowideit\\_>\u00a0is now known as <SvenDowideit>  \n14:25\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n14:56\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Greetings from Mountain View  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0didn't realize the GSOC summiwas now  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I envy you\u2026.  \n18:28\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Did you find a RM for Monday?  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll probably do it  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least start the stabilization  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if ready start it, if not fabio or me will do it on Tuesday  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we need ATM is that all devs  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0look at the CI  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and fix the build issues  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jv has made platform fail on friday  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's not the biggest thing to fix; a lot of functional tests are failing  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and flickering ones need to be fixed because that's too much a pain - we got tons of daily emails about jenkins)  \n18:30\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, saw that  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0make sure you speak to other wiki/collaboration communities at GSOC summit! And invite them to our dev room @ FOSDEM maybe...  \n18:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Oh, did you get an answer?  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n18:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0They were supposed to announce the devrooms mid-october  \n18:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's past mid  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right....  \n18:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I have a presentation at the summt  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool, what topic?  \n18:35\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Ensuring the continuing success of a GSoC project  \n18:35\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0http://sergiu.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Presentation/GSoCMS?skin=Presentation.PresentationSkin#1  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahah nice app ;)  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a010-15% chance of failure only! I'd have said more like 80% chance of failure  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends what we call failure I guess  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Right...  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me failure = the code isn't integrated  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I mean complete failure  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I'll add that  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0You're right  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"t's OK to also have personal communication just with the mentor\". Yep, same as our IRC chats; the rule being that anything important should find its way on the list (so that other committers/sonctributors who're not online can have the time to see them)  \n18:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Probably fixed platform build  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah coo  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0l  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"towards the end there should be a few commits per day\". I'd say this should happen starrting from at least the middle of the period (if not sooner)  \n18:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0These need to be updated since there's no more QuickLinks panel: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/1864/testReport/  \n18:42\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, I'll say that, but the idea is that it should definitely be this way towards the end  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's still a quick links panel  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it contains only 1 entry now  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(sandbox)  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually for us a nice project in contrib that lives on and with a published etxension is also a success  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it doesn't necessarily have to be integrated in the platform)  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I think)  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(because we have that extension model)  \n18:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I think being in the platform is better  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's really important is that what is coded can be used in a useful manner by users  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course what's really key is that it's maintained  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that can be done by offloading to committers (integrated in platform) or in a maintained contrib project  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or of course the saint graal which is to become a committer ;))  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"can be used in a useful manner by users\" == extension for us  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(be it a platform extension or a contrib extension)  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course contrib doesn't mean not following the project's best practices  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just thinking aloud here :)  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0interesting presentation for brainstomring with the other orgs  \n18:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n18:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Finished reading?  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another good presentation would have been:  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how to attract contributors to your project  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep finished  \n18:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Any other suggestions?  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope looks good  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0missing images of course  \n18:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0(I changed already with what you said)  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(too much text)  \n18:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Thanks for the feedback  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's another story ;)  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at least it's self explanatory)  \n18:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yeah, I always start with lots of ideas for images to use instead of text  \n18:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But in the end I always end up with all-text  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know how much time you have, it might be long or not  \n18:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Me neither...  \n18:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0There's no schedule  \n18:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Jerome is late  \n18:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Didn't see him so far  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0brb  \n18:59\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Found Jerome  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back  \n19:05\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:09\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol1: now that I see the repo created I have a ton of ideas on how to better improve what I've done so far.
