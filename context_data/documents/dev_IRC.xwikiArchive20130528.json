 \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: the easiest is to install the debian package  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the postgres one  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well  \n13:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok. because I didn't have any problems with the WAR  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0problem is that you can't do that easily with a snapshot  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you can't see the issue with the WAR  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue is with generated hibernate file and you don't use a generated bibernate file  \n13:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't have any other distribution that the debian one with postgres  \n13:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the way to test it is you build XWiki youself wth postgres profile  \n13:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: actually it might be easy now to installe the debian snapshot package  \n13:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, I always wondered myself, does the debian package has a direct dependency to the postgres package ?  \n13:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jdeb is supposed to have improved snapshot support but did not tested it since  \n13:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:54\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0meaning if I don't have postgres installed, installing the xwiki package will also install postgres ?  \n13:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you can use \"apt-cache show xwiki-enterprise-pgsql-common\" to get details about a package  \n13:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and yes if you don't have postgre it will be installed, the whole point is that when you install XWiki is just work  \n13:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you can add http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/xwiki-snapshots.list file to your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to install snapshot debian packages  \n14:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0can someone tell me if this is in 4.5.4 ? http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8813 it seems \u00a0that Denis committed on the 4.5.x branch but he didn't add 4.5.4 fixVersion, and I want to make sure  \n14:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you will need Denis to really confirm but yes there is a related commit on 4.5 branch  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in the meantime I'm pretty sure you can assume it's included in 4.5.4  \n14:04\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n14:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, what about http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-261 .Is it included in 4.5.4 ?

I need more details to try to reproduce  \n14:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0re webstandards, it's complicated, the placeholder attribute is nicer than withTip CSS class but it's HTML5.. Maybe we can enable HTML5 validation. Otherwise I'll switch back to withTip.  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do we ensure it works also without HTML5?  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or do we want to support only browser versions supporting HTML5?  \n14:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not sure what to do about the failing ui tests, due to the lost white space in XML attribute value. I tried XMLUtils.escapeXMLAttribute but it doesn't encode the white space  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think we've ever talked about this  \n14:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, that's why I said it's complicated.

But in any case, it's the same with withTip behavior  \n15:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's even better because the platholder attribute is a stadnard, while the withTip class is our invention  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, I don't really know about the details of the use cases, \u00a0I just want to make sure our code works on the browser we support and WCAG support is not broken  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as much as possible since the automated test we have for WCAG are far from enough unfortunately and we don't perform manual WCAG tests ATM :())  \n15:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it doesn't matter if the browser doesn't support the placeholder attribute, we have JS code that make sure the behaviour is similar  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n15:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0@Devs: when you have the time, could you check http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9127 ?  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: indeed looks like a huge blocker  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't even understand how we released 5.0.2 without this TBH  \n15:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0maybe because it didn't had a fixFox so no dev noticed it  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed blocker must ALWAYS have a fixfor  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise it's not a blocker....  \n15:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, next time I report a blocker I'll ask a dev to put a \"fixFor\" for it  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I imagines it will get noticed.. but ..  \n15:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\\*imagined  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm proposing to put a blocker on 5.0.3 and 5.1M2 for now wdyt?  \n15:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I'm +1 if someone else besides me is able to confirm  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: manuel confirmed already  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: why did you say \"update hibernate.cfg.xml\" in the desc?  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what needs to be updated?  \n15:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I think that is redundant. I wanted to say \"update hibernate.cfg.xml to use HSQLDB\" but that is already the defaul AFAIR  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you said to configure HSQLDB as the first step  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why would you want to change the hib config?  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you meant to say:  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't overwrite your xwiki configuration files  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n15:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0there are 2 waysof migrating HSQLDB: 1)you either replace the webapp (which I did), or move the database and data folder to another instance.  \n15:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\"Put the 5.0.1 WAR in Jetty or Tomcat + HSQLDB jar + update hibernate.cfg.xml.

Is this needed or can I skip this step?  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or should I import over the existing pages?  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also is it the XE ui-all or the XEM ui-all XAR?  \n15:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I tried manager, so XEM ui-all  \n15:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0and yes, I imported over the existing pages  \n15:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0because initially you have no database since you're not using a packaged distro, but you deploy de WAR in the container  \n15:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so this is a little bit of an atypical setup for HSQLDB  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr?  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you said: \"Setup a XWiki 4.1.4 using Jetty + HSQLDB\"  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you really need to improve your descriptios sorin  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and be a lot more precise  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it's impossible to reproduce  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0without asking 10 questions to you  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that takes a lot of time  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I was testing on TOmcat + HSQLDB and msmeria tested on Jetty + HSQLDB AFAIK  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also try to use to simplest config that fails  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that makes it simpler to reproduce and fix  \n15:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what should I do now?  \n15:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can I use XE?  \n15:54\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0according to msmeria yes  \n15:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: hi  \n15:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0you can use XE  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: you imported the xe ui-all XAR over the existing db?  \n15:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I used the jetty-hsqldb version  \n15:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0nope  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: can you edit the issue and explain how I can reprouce using XE?  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or add a comment)  \n15:56\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0sure  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n15:56\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a01min  \n15:56\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0np  \n16:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9127?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-75509  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks msmeria, trying  \n16:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0yw  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: there are a few missing things in your steps  \n16:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0like what ?  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first you kept the same data/ directory  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which means there's no db migration  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex, I get: \"No data migration to apply for database [xwiki] currently in version [43000]\"  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm forget this  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I get the DW  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do I need to skip it or should I run it?  \n16:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0run it  \n16:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I've edited my comment several times  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'e refreshed  \n16:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0:)  \n16:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: reproduced  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why does the issue say it's related to HSQLDB?  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0did you test on another DB and it worked?  \n16:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0sburjan: I tested on Postgres and I was not able to reproduce.

You could write: <input type=\"text\" value=\"$!escapetool.xml($request.param)\" class=\"withTip useTitleAsTip\" title=\"This is the placeholder\"/>  \n16:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm... To overcome the validity issue?  \n16:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I can fix the validation tests this way because this use case was the main reason I had to use the placeholder attribute  \n16:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n16:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Sounds semantic to me, +1  \n16:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I need it for instance on search, where the initial value is the submitted search term, but I still want to display a placeholder when the input value is deleted  \n16:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But I wonder if it makes sense in general to leave the title in place or not  \n16:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0We might have to rephrase a few tips to be good titles  \n16:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0wait  \n16:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's only one way, title -> tip  \n16:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0why do you say we should rephrase the tips?  \n16:47\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm speaking in general  \n16:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you mean to use the title by default as tip?  \n16:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0If we move the tip from value= to title=, and the title is still going to be displayed onhover by the browser, some of the tips that we're using now won't be meaningful as titles  \n16:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But we probably won't do this en-masse, anyway  \n16:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Just something to keep in mind when we decide to move a tip to the title  \n16:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes. Note that I tried to change the doctype but it breaks all validation tests. We may need a new validator for HTML5. Also, I tested the HTML of the home page with the HTML5 doctype on w3c validator and there are a few errors, most of them related to the meta tags, \"keywork is not registered\" or something like that. So moving to HTML5 will require a bit of work, definitely not for 5.1M1  \n16:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I am still NOT able to reproduce on postgres.
