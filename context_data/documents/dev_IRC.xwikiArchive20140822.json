an old version of the commons repository  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n17:10\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Probably since commons wasn't built on that agent in a long time  \n17:10\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And it find an ancient version of the POM there  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've explained the problem in my commit  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in comment  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not it's not good  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0100% sure  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/and not/and no  \n17:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It is good  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you check my comment in pom.xml please  \n17:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's just having side effects  \n17:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've explained in details  \n17:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0That's exactly what I'm saying  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I tried)  \n17:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It has an old version of commons  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0side effect is not a good thing  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0obviously  \n17:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The issue isn't that it's wrong to point to the parent project  \n17:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But that Jenkins shouldn't have repos like that  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first, it's wrong to assume a certain layout  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially when using /..  \n17:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0That's an invisible dependency between workspaces  \n17:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Ah, I know how I get that error  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0second, as I mentioned I cannot reproduce your warning issue  \n17:13\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I have a different pom.xml in the parent folder  \n17:13\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: It's not wrong to assume a certain layout  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with ../ I think it is  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0epecially in maven  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as there's no notion of workspace yet  \n17:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But there already is a certain layout assumed  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0inside a projet yes  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0inside a reactor project that is  \n17:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0By default Maven assumes that the parent is in the parent directory  \n17:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0No, not a reactor project, any project  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I know, but your change makes it even more likely to cause some problem  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n17:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Try it: change xwiki-commons/pom.xml, don't build it, and build a descendant module  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we should use a relativepath that cannot exist  \n17:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It will see the changes  \n17:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Even if the pom is not installed  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know how maven works sdumitriu :)  \n17:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Because of the implicit parent path I get that error, so if we define an explicit path that doesn't exist, nothing wrong happens  \n17:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It will just be silently ignored as before  \n17:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: To make something clear, I'm not arguing for restoring my commit, just arguing that your motivation is invalid  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my motivation cannot be wrong :)  \n17:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0There is a bug in Jenkins, and as a workaround your fix is good at the moment  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it fixed the CI  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's my mtovation  \n17:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0K, not motivation, reasoning  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I know is that my 'fix\" isn't perfect  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but as you said there's no good solution  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0except maybe the invalid path , I need to try that  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to check if maven still checks the parent in case of an invalid relativepath  \n17:18\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I think that looking for a parent is a new feature in Maven3, I kind of remember that it didn't read parents from the filesystem a long time ago  \n17:18\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:18\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But I might be wrong  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looking for parent has always been there  \n17:19\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Even if the parent is not in the reactor?  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that I don't know  \n17:19\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It should look for the parent in repos  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:20\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But I know that a long time ago I had to install changed parent poms before building children  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0between top level repos yes  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because they're not in parent-child relationship  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but inside a top level project it has always worked fine for me  \n17:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Even in 2007?  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as far back as I've used maven  \n17:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0With the right relativePath, it will work cross-repo as well  \n17:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0OK  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even m1  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but my memory may be failing me  \n17:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0By the way, Jenkins doesn't load for me  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it depends  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sometimes it's very fast sometimes our apache front end times out  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it always succeeds but our front times out when it's too long  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie above 30 seconds or so)  \n17:24\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: just to be clear  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the warning you were getting before  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(before your commit)  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was due to you having some wrong pom.xml in a directory above your top level repos directories?  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie above xwiki-commons, xwiki-rendering, etc  \n17:25\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone suggested using an empty <relativePath></relativePath> in a jira
