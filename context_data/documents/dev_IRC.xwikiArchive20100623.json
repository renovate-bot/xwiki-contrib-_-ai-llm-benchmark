 \ntmortagne - (08:47): hi  \ntmortagne - (08:48): proyvind: export your mysql wiki to as xar and then import it in the postgresql wiki  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:48): You have seen the light ;) \u00a0I would do an export to an xar file and then import it.  \nproyvind - (08:50): tmortagne: k, sounds like something I could manage :o)  \ntmortagne - (08:50): if your wiki is too big for the standard export (does not need to be very big unfortunately :() you might look at http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Snippets/LargeWikiExportSnippet and http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Snippets/LargeXARImportScriptSnippet  \nproyvind - (08:50): k  \nproyvind - (08:50): thx! :)  \ntmortagne - (08:50): you'r welcome :)  \nvmassol - (08:52): so today is the 3rd try to release XE 2.4M2.....  \nvmassol - (08:53): it would be great that all of us help make the release ready  \nvmassol - (08:53): ie fix the tests so that they pass  \ntmortagne - (08:53): yep there are still lots of failing selenium tests  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 08:53  \nvmassol - (08:53): ie stop what you're doing for half a day to focus on making the tests pass  \ntmortagne - (08:54): plus 1 wysiwyg test  \nvmassol - (08:54): it's not normal we need several days to stabilize a release  \nvmassol - (08:54): the tests should pass every day  \nvmassol - (08:54): so we have a problem to fix  \nvmassol - (08:55): CalebJamesDeLisl: I'm trying to fix one of your tests on my machine btw  \nvmassol - (08:55): RegisterFromAdministrationTest  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:55): Breaks on your machine and not on hudson?  \nvmassol - (08:55): which has several tests failing locally (they pass on hudson which seems to indicate they are flickering IMO)  \nvmassol - (08:55): yep  \nvmassol - (08:55): they are:  \nvmassol - (08:55): testRegisterPasswordTooShort  \nvmassol - (08:55): testRegisterDifferentPasswords  \nvmassol - (08:56): testRegisterEmptyUserName  \nvmassol - (08:56): testRegisterInvalidEmail  \nvmassol - (08:56): the reason is:  \nvmassol - (08:56): \"java.lang.AssertionError: LiveValidation did not show a failure message but clicking on the register button did.\"  \nvmassol - (08:56): so the live validation didn't show up (or was too slow or...)  \nvmassol - (08:56): while the verif worked when pressing the submit button  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:56): Yea, I have had a lot of trouble with that.  \nvmassol - (08:57): IMO  \nvmassol - (08:57): s/IMO//  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:57): I can't figure out a better way to prove that liveValidation is doing something.  \nvmassol - (08:57): yes  \nvmassol - (08:57): so we just need to find a way to fix the test  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:58): Maybe run a javascript snippet to manually fire liveValidation, I took a look at it and found it was hooked to the submit event and I didn't see an easy way to get hold of the listener.  \nvmassol - (08:59): a lot of tests are not very resilient to change too  \nvmassol - (08:59): like this one:  \nvmassol - (08:59): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return !getDriver().findElements(By.xpath(\"/html/body/div/div/div[3]/div/div/div/div/div/script\")).isEmpty();  \nvmassol - (08:59): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:59): You found it! ;)  \nvmassol - (08:59): did I?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:00): You found the horrible hack for finding if the script is there.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:00): I suppose the correct thing to do is attach an id to the script and look for that.  \nvmassol - (09:00): well there are several places that are not correct  \nvmassol - (09:00): like this one too:  \nvmassol - (09:00): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By.xpath(\"//a[@class='tool rename' and contains(@href, '\" + getUtil().escapeURL(fromName) + \"')]/img\");  \nvmassol - (09:01): (but that's for the blog category)  \nvmassol - (09:01): this test will fail if you rename to a category that contains the original category's name  \nvmassol - (09:01): anyway  \nvmassol - (09:01): my point is just that we need to be careful to make tests resilient to change  \nvmassol - (09:01): by introducing whatever is needed in the html for ex  \nvmassol - (09:01): so that we don't spend too much time fixing them  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:02): I've been trying to use ids in the invitation tests.  \nvmassol - (09:02): yep id are a good way  \nvmassol - (09:02): provided we are careful  \nvmassol - (09:02): since they need to be unique  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:03): Another thing I have been doing lately is making the tests long and test more stuff so because invitation tests would take 1/2 hour if each thing was tested separately.  \nvmassol - (09:03): yes it's definitely important  \nvmassol - (09:03): that's what I was trying to say for some time  \nvmassol - (09:03): :)  \nvmassol - (09:03): in unit tests you want as fine-grained as possible  \nvmassol - (09:03): in functional tests you want a scenario  \nvmassol - (09:04): (ie run checks in series and not isolated)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:04): hmm. did you see r29642  \nvmassol - (09:04): (there's the right granularity to find though)  \nvmassol - (09:04): I saw it but didn't read it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:05): It opens up an xml file into a directory tree so we can work on applications easier.  \nvmassol - (09:05): I know what it's about but didn't check the code  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:05): It's ugly --> my own xml parser  \nvmassol - (09:05): why don't you use one of the thousand tools avail?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:06): For example there are schemas and attributes and such which I don't care what they are. I just need to be able to reproduce them.  \nvmassol - (09:06): ok found your comment  \nvmassol - (09:06): but I'm not sure I agree with it  \nvmassol - (09:06): :)  \nvmassol - (09:06): anyway  \nvmassol - (09:07): it's your code, you choose to write it as you want  \nvmassol - (09:07): just don't expect too much that someone else will work on it! ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:08): Good point. I figure if it is useful then I can refactor. Otherwise it will go in the dead idea pile.  \nvmassol - (09:08): yes....  \ntmortagne - (09:20): does anyone remember how to get the current index in a velocity #foreach ? http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html talk about $foreach.count but that does not seems to work with the version we are using  \nvmassol - (09:20): yes there's a variable  \nvmassol - (09:20): velocityIndex or something let me check  \ntmortagne - (09:21): yep i know that's the name of the variable i don't know :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:21): $velicityCount if I recall.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:21): s/velicity/velocity  \nsburjan - (09:21): hello vmassol , CalebJamesDeLisl  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:22): hi  \nvmassol - (09:22): \"If you want a zero-based index of the #foreach loop, you can just use $foreach.index instead of $foreach.count.\"  \ntmortagne - (09:22): CalebJamesDeLisl: yep that's it, thanks  \nvmassol - (09:22): http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html#Loops  \ntmortagne - (09:22): vmassol: as i said that doe snot work  \nsburjan - (09:22): I wanted to ask you something for my understanding about the XWiki platform mailing system  \ntmortagne - (09:22): (09:20:35 AM) <moi>: does anyone remember how to get the current index in a velocity #foreach ? http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html talk about $foreach.count but that does not seems to work with the version we are using  \nvmassol - (09:23): http://www.mail-archive.com/[[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)/msg11477.html  \nsburjan - (09:23): my question is if that all applications that use mail sending use the same lib  \nsburjan - (09:23): or the mailing system from CORE  \nvmassol - (09:23): https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-600  \nsburjan - (09:24): because I'm seeing a Mail Plugin on xwiki.org, and I don;t know if all the apps use that. I am more intrested in E-mail registration, Watch Notifier and Invitation manager  \nvmassol - (09:24): tmortagne: they've changed it  \nvmassol - (09:24): here: http://velocity.apache.org/engine/releases/velocity-1.6.4/user-guide.html#Loops  \nvmassol - (09:24): the doc I pointed you to is for the next release  \nvmassol - (09:25): so we have to know it's going to be changed in the future  \nsburjan - (09:25): because if all of them use the same plugin or functionality, I'd like to improve the documentation  \ntmortagne - (09:25): vmassol: I guessed and the new one is a lot better btw  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:26): sburjan: I think they all use it. I just checked and the core XWiki.createUser function uses an old deprecated sender instead.  \nvmassol - (09:26): sburjan: I don't know would need to look at teh code and we do need to have a single place int he code to send mails  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:28): After a second look, yes everything uses the plugin. The core only defaults to the deprecated code only if the plugin isn't available.  \nmariusbutuc joined #xwiki at 09:28  \nsburjan - (09:29): okay.  \nsburjan - (09:29): because I want to improve the documentation aboutthe settings of the plugin  \nflorinciu left at 09:29 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsburjan - (09:29): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HConfiguringtheSMTPserver  \nsburjan - (09:29): I want to update this  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:30): That's great. I saw a comment in the plugin code telling where to find all of the options. Looking...  \nsburjan - (09:30): yes.. that's what I want to do  \nsburjan - (09:30): especially the javamail extra params  \nsburjan - (09:31): I think the most important should be mentioned  \nsburjan - (09:31): IMO  \nsburjan - (09:31): but If you consider this unnecessary, you could tell me  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:32): Here's a list of them all: http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html  \nsburjan - (09:33): thanks  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:33): We already used mail.smtp.localhost and that's documented in the Invitation app.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 09:33  \nsburjan - (09:34): yepp  \nsburjan - (09:34): butI'd like to document the SSL/TLS section  \nsburjan - (09:34): because it seems our javamail supports those too  \nsburjan - (09:34): but are undocummented  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:36): :) \u00a0I think you still have to provide the encryption engine.  \nsburjan - (09:38): are you sure ?  \nsburjan - (09:38): I don;t know the code, never seen it  \nsburjan - (09:39): props.put(\u201cmail.smtp.host\u201d, \u201c<put your smtp server here>\u201d);  \nsburjan - (09:39): props.put(\u201cmail.smtp.starttls.enable\u201d, \u201ctrue\u201d);  \nsburjan - (09:39): props.put(\u201cmail.smtp.ssl.protocols\u201d,\u201dSSLv3 TLSv1?);  \nsburjan - (09:39): i see this in javamail .. I searched on the internet  \nsburjan - (09:40): what version of javamail does the mail plugin uses ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:40): have to check the pom file.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:41): find ./ -name 'pom.xml' -exec grep 'javamail' {} \\; -print  \ntmortagne - (09:41): guys DWG does not likes tables without header cells, what should we do for tables like the one on http://tuska.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?xpage=rename&step=1 ?  \nsburjan - (09:45): vmassol, \u00a0: http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Skins/ColibriSkin . Check the Adding New Theme  \nsburjan - (09:46): this is kinda deprecated, because we have create new there here http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/ColorThemeApplication which is much morea easier  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:48): Hmm, no references to javamail. It must be determined by the version of java.  \ntmortagne left at 09:50 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (09:59): sburjan: anything related to themes shouldn't be in that page  \nvmassol - (09:59): but instead in the color theme app page  \nsburjan - (09:59): okay  \nsburjan - (09:59): i'll move them from there into the ColorTheme App  \nvmassol - (09:59): thanks  \nvmassol - (09:59): (since it'll work with any skin that supports color themes)  \nvmassol - (10:00): bb in 2mn  \nvmassol left at 10:00 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 10:02  \nvmassol - (10:08): \u2122   \nvmassol - (10:08): oops  \nvmassol - (10:09): (that was the auto complete for tmoragne\u2026 but he's not there :))  \nsburjan - (10:09): :))  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 10:14  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:18  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:20  \ntmortagne - (10:22): CalebJamesDeLisl: you will get another DWG failure because of the style= I think  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:23): There are a bunch of style= in there.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:23): The problem is that's the only way some email clients accept style information.  \ntmortagne - (10:23): yep i seen that  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 10:23  \ntmortagne - (10:24): we should maybe filter it in tests with a comment or something  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:24): I could hack around it but then it wouldn't be a preview.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:25): Something like CODESTYLE:OFF?  \ntmortagne - (10:26): CalebJamesDeLisl: i mean not executing DWG test for it  \ntmortagne - (10:26): like we do for Syntax page  \ntmortagne - (10:26): s/DWG test/some DWG tests/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:27): Is it something where I can at the pom and see how it's done?  \ntmortagne - (10:27): see http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/trunk/distribution-test/webstandards-tests/src/test/it/com/xpn/xwiki/it/CustomDutchWebGuidelinesValidator.java  \ntmortagne - (10:28): it's not in the pom but in a customized validator for XE  \ntmortagne - (10:28): CalebJamesDeLisl: would be better nicer in the pom but feel free to refactor ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:28): I'll take a look.
