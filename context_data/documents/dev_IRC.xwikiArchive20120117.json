I have a short question. If I have a linkblock who's resource type is ResourceType.INTERWIKI, can I be sure that it's resource reference is absolute? (and not relative to current wiki / current space) ?  \n15:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0not expert on these things ... but good that you got an error too .. too bad not the same one :(  \n15:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: really you have a interwiki, how you do that ? xwiki parser or renderers don't support it yet  \n15:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0because this is the 4th time I am able to reproduce, so there is definitely something. My machine has 8gb of RAM, so I'm pretty sure i'm not out of memory  \n15:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: yea, trying to find what is consuming the permgen but it's not going to be easy I think  \n15:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0do you know this application well ?  \n15:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: no I don't, I need to transform all the links in my document in links with absolute references and I was wondering which ones I need to handle (doc i know, attach I know, and I was wondering about the others)  \n15:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: not at all.  \n15:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: will check first what is this application  \n15:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I'll try reproducing with other apps  \n15:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: since it's supposed to target some other wiki (not even a xwiki) I guess you could see it as absolute  \n15:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: ok  \n15:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: aham, ok. Actually my questions would be, if I copy paste that wiki syntax to another doc and I render it, will the link point to the same location? I guess the answer is yes  \n15:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: said another way it's supposed to be an extrenal link by definition  \n15:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, even better :)  \n15:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when it will be supported...  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch another broken page on xwiki.org: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/References/WebHome  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has a blog xobject  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing  \n15:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: tried with ircbot app, and I am unable to reproduce. trying another app. any suggestion of a larger app ?  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice xwiki wiki: http://www.afdcc.com/  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: presentation application is pretty small as far as I can see  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0don't know any big application  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0admin app maybe  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0presentation app is quite large  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not that big but bigger than IRC for sure  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has one page doing several MBs  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with tons of image attachments  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so maybe thats the issue then  \n15:18\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0hmmmm... tried ircbot, FAQ, and now with Monitoring Tools  \n15:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok so the issue is not really the size of the application but the size of one of the application pages I think  \n15:19\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0unable to reproduce with these  \n15:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I debugiing it anyway  \n15:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: yea I think you will not be able to reproduce it unless you find or produce an application with a big pages like presentation application has  \n15:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lets see what is loosing memory then  \n15:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: would you have a stack trace of when you get an error uninstalling ?  \n15:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0trying to import the xar with normal import UI first  \n15:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I sould have seen that the xar file was more than 9M...  \n15:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: was it the first time you were trying to install this application ?  \n15:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or did it used to work ?  \n15:22\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: yes. first time .. I don't remember installing it before  \n15:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok lets fins what's wrong  \n15:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's a good test case for the EM internal importer  \n15:23\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0managed to get the stack trace by going to /xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/InstalledExtensions and Uninstalling it from there.

The easiest is to move the corresponding dependencyManagement and pluginManagement sections from xwiki-enterprise-test to xwiki-enterprise pom, so that they are inherited by xwiki-manager and then by xwiki-manager-test pom. WDYT?
