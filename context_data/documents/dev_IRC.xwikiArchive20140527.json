You might ask mflorea since he did the original wysiwyg editor  \n09:05\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0I screw with it alot :-)  \n09:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mflorea: you remember how the wysiwyg calculates positions of submenus?  \n09:07\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Thats what I end up  \n09:07\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0http://de.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-27052014-090607.php  \n09:08\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0http://de.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-27052014-090730.php  \n09:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh yeah, that's annoying :)  \n09:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n09:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0kaisen: play with position: relative on your containers. Usually that's how you position things, but the solution depends on the CSS you've added and your containers.  \n09:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think the problem is that the <body> is centered but the wysiwyg is locating it's menus against something unknown  \n09:12\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Ok until no I didn't touch the containers - I will have a try  \n09:13\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0Anyone have any idea about the $blacklistedspaces getting set for all spaces in the application panel when you hide it?  \n09:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0cjd: theoretically the wysiwyg can be centered also in XWiki, when using the both panels sides  \n09:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0teekay: I don't - sorry  \n09:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0indeed, I was able to center a wysiwyg editor.. but I was not centering the entire wiki  \n09:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0#css #magic  \n09:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0teekay: Applications Panel should not have any impact on the blacklisted, maybe the error is somewhere else  \n09:15\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0bandaid solution of declaring it before I use it works but.. i'm just curious as to why this happens  \n09:16\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0yea maybe, i dont think i touched it anywhere in my skins either but i guess i'll have a closer look again. Just wanted to know if there was something through Panels that did something  \n09:16\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Did the Blacklist still work? I thought you need to hidden all pages in a space to hide the space  \n09:16\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0it does work  \n09:17\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0you can either declare it in xwikivars.vm or specify it in your velocity script  \n09:17\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0but my one gets overwritten somewhere and i don't know where :/  \n09:17\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0I tried to edit the xwikivars.vm but the Spaces where shown all time  \n09:18\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0I just know that you need to disable the show hidden content in your profile  \n09:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0check whether xwikivars.vm is overridden for the skin you're using (colibri)  \n09:18\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you might be editing one which is inactive  \n09:19\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0does colibri overwrite it?  \n09:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you'd have to look, I forgot  \n09:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0kaisen: the CSS for the WYSIWYG editor menus is in resources/js/xwiki/wysiwyg/xwe/stylesheets/Wysiwyg.css . I don't remember exactly how the menus calculate the position, but you should look at their CSS.  \n09:44\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@mflorea thx  \n09:46\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n09:47\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:25\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n10:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: I have rebuilt enterprise at home  \n10:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and I still have the problem with webjars  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok let me download from maven  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe a dep is missing somewhere  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or maybe the CI hasn't rebuild everything yet  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you rebuilt the mdules I mentioned?

With layerd css it doesn't work as the drop down is added on demand and load it afterwords. I know the variable I need to change but now where :( Maybe you have an idea where I could find it.

Junco (a skin done by me) is having a centered layout and I haven't had any problem with the WYSIWYG styling. I'm sure is kaisen code somewhere.  \n15:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh cool  \n15:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Junco+Skin#HTheme:Blueberry \u2026 it is centered.  \n15:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Anyway if all else fails, the big hammer is something like this: require(['jquery'], function ($) { document.observe('xwiki:wysiwyg:created', function() { $('#gwt-whatever').css({position:'fixed'}); }); });  \n15:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0kaisen: I don't think is a good idea to start modifying internal WYSIWYG code and replace position: absolute with fixed.
