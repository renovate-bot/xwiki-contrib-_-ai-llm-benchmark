6.0M1 releases  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I see the 2 remaining issues are still open on http://jira.xwiki.org/issues/?filter=12690&jql=project%20in%20(XCOMMONS%2C%20XRENDERING%2C%20XWIKI%2C%20XE)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%225.4.3%22

would need someone to replace him just for 6.0M1  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to release 6.0M1 today  \n10:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I'm closing XWIKI-9595 in a few minutes, but I still have XWIKI-9716  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this test has failed for the last \u00a02 builds on master:

\n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes the other issue is a bit of work I guess so I can take care of 6.0M1 if needed  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that'd be cool  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to

:)  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sbalaoul: internally this is what happens: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0QueryFilter queryFilter = this.componentManager.getInstance(QueryFilter.class, filter);  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the name you pass correspond to a component hont  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*hint  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you wish to add your own custom filter, you need to develop it in java  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you can find a few tutorials on xwiki.org for writing java components)  \n11:23\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0vmassol: thanks :)  \n11:42\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:42\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:58\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:59\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: what is the extension id for http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Bootstrap+Framework ?  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we have a bootstrap extension?  \n12:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0no we do not  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it's wrong :)  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0extensions are for .. extensions :)  \n12:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I mean  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should go in the platform dev guide instead  \n12:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0We will have it as soon is is built  \n12:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0exactly like http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Colibri+Skin  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is a skin  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bootstrap is not a skin  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0flamingo is a skin  \n12:02\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the extension will be flamingo no?  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me  \n12:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes ok, it is ok for flamingo, but not for bootstrap  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it looks like bootstrap will be integrated in the web module  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's were it is right now at least  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki-platform-web  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the question is :  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0will it make sense to split -web in 2?  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or not?  \n12:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0maybe it should be there: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/FrontendResources  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sure it should go there for now  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this was my point)  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0best would be that we don't have boostrap at all in our source...  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course we shouldn't have bootstrap :)  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I guess it's not about bootstrap itself  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but about integration with bootstrap  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note: http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|bootstrap  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so to recap  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this doc should be moved to the dev guide for now  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we'll see later in the future if we need some kind of \"bootstrap\"' extesnion or not  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(probably not)  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0agree gdelhumeau?  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see much from us in https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/resources/uicomponents/bootstrap3  \n12:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it looks like pure bootstrap  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we want to have xwiki work without an internet connection  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we would need to provide bootstrap  \n12:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I never suggested to not bundle bootstrap  \n12:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0there is a fix to get the XWIki URL of glyphicons  \n12:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm talking about git  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed it's very very bad  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to have it in our sources  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially with the webjar integration I did  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is why I ondicated http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|bootstrap  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@tmortagne: I did a webjar integration for this  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. boostrap in in maven  \n12:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes I wanted to look at the webdav integration  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0webjar  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not webdav :)  \n12:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*ebjar  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: even without webjar  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we can do exactly what we do with skins  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0webjar is much nicer  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it handles js dependencies, is maintained by 3rd parties, etc  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no meantoime  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0webjar is working \\*\\*now\\*\\*  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if not, I'd like to know because that's our plan  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to use webjars for js/css resources)  \n12:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: there are 2 (Extension)RepositoryTest failing, related to the way the description field is computed. I remember you did some changes recently. maybe you can take a look.
