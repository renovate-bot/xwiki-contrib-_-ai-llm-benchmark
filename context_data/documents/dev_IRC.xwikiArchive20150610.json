(sarcastic tone)  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tihk we can safely says that dom4j is not maintained anymore: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dom4j/files/  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mail sent  \n17:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hey, they have java5 compatibility and we don't :(  \n17:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh, it's only a goal, ok then  \n17:09\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Hi devs, pure coincidence of the day, I found this https://github.com/xwikisas/xcs/blob/master/xcs-web/pom.xml#L256  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n17:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And I've work recently on transformation with saxon  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wrote this  \n17:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Which seems to support more recent XSL than Xalan  \n17:20\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And probably support the same standard of interface  \n17:20\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Just to mention  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes could be a good replacement but the problem is that most fwk we use use xalan transitively  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for example jdom2 2.0.6 uses xalan 2.7.2)  \n17:22\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Argh  \n17:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0But if the dependency you use has itself a dependency which is Xalan, don't know exactly how you plan to remove Xalan  \n17:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0:-)  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea :)  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the second option listed sounds better though  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"or find a good maven packaging of it \"  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes, best would be a better xalan package  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue is that we have this dependency at commons level so we can't just do this package ourself (like I do for jython for this kind of reasons)  \n17:25\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0In any case, so far that I've investigated, if everything in Jdom2 uses the standard javax.xml.transform interface, then switching to Saxon in Jdom2 should not be a big problem  \n17:25\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(but I don't know if you can force such thing to a dependency... niark  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you're right  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and jdom's pom does mention that xalan is optional  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i don't know why they depend on it btw  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they should depend on the interfaces only  \n17:27\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Because they need to depend on one implementation at one point  \n17:27\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0?  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why?  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're supposed to be able to pick the impl you wish  \n17:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0it was a question...  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I know it was a question)  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, but then it means that if you compile JDom2 without configuration, you can't use it, right?  \n17:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0You need to know that you need to add an implementation  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need an impl to use it  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first you add a compile dep on the interface  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if you wish you can add a \\*runtime\\* dep on xalan as optional  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if you really need it but I don't think it's needed for a lib)  \n17:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0You're the master of Maven (or to say it differently, this is where I'm a bit lost)  \n17:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0:-P  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if it were an app it would be a different story)  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and JAXP is in the JDK normally  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you don't even need an dep on the interfaces  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(xalan also is in the jdk btw but ;))  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes you have an implementation by default so you don't NEED xalan  \n17:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has quit  \n17:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0anybody on?
