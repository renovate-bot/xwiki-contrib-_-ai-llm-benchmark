 \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and what are teh consequences?  \n10:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not quickly  \n10:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the direct consequence is that some wiki component are not working right after you import the \u00a0XE XAR  \n10:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but they work after a restart for example  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so if we don't fix it we need to put a warning about it in the 4.4 RN  \n10:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's less visible wiki DW because the admin app is installed first so the admin user is their when importing most wiki components  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and fix it in 4.5  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would need mflorea on XWIKI-8599 but seems pretty blocker  \n10:08\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0tmortagne: so the issue is with documents imported \\_before\\_ XWiki.Admin and XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup, am I getting it right ?  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jvdrean: should be debugged to be sure but given the error and the fact that DW does not have the issue that's the thing that come to my mind  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-8207 is blocker when it happen but it happen almost never but no idea if it's complex to fix or not  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you included XINFRA in your link about issue without fix for  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I included all projects that have a 4.4 fixfor but I don't see any infra issue  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=fixVersion+=+%224.4%22+and+resolution+=+Unresolved  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when I click on the link you gave in the mail I get all the infra issues  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah mail  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry wrong context  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed they need to be excluded  \n10:20\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I broke the build yesterday, fixing  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I forgot to add a dep on teh new annotatedxhtml module  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0making some functional tests fail  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bb in 30mn  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:20\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:54\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems I'm still missing some dep in platform, fixing  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm we don't receive jenkins emails anymore  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Platform/job/xwiki-platform/3091/console  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"No emails were triggered.\"  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the build was successful but tests failed  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mabye the nex mail configuration doesn't handle this  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*new  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to check that  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n18:49\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n20:33\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:25\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:27\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:30\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n23:30\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0is now known as <rrodriguez>\n"}
