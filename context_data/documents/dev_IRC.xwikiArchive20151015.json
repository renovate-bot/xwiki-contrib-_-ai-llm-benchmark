Do you think you have the time to have a look at this: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/MOCCACAL-77? I want to make a release soon enough, but we have this blocker. Thank you!  \n13:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0gsmeria: I had to meet a deadline yesterday and are now catching up on things ... that issue is specific to XWiki 7.2, right?  \n13:36\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0yep  \n13:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0If you want to make a release, just keep the old dependency to XWiki 6.x ... as I guess the fixes in the release also apply to these xwiki versions ?  \n13:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0or are the other fixes \"7.x only\", too ?  \n13:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0saying that, I planned to look into that this evening, just have to fix something else before  \n13:39\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ClemensR: I don't think there is anything else 7.x only.  \n13:39\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0ClemensR: there's just that one  \n13:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ClemensR: anwyay - when you have time :) thanks  \n13:40\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0Thank you, ClemensR!  \n13:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Ok, then I would propose to proceed with the release when it suits you -and I will try to check the remaining issue asap.  \n13:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ClemensR: the release is not urgent. The only thing is that the issue is blocker if you are using 7.2+  \n13:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0that's why we are asking  \n13:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0actually\u2026. you cannot create new calendars - in rest you can use the app  \n13:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and yes - you will need to see if it's something that can fixed without changing the platform version  \n13:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0actually I planned to update the required dependency to XWiki 7.2 for MoccaCal 2.4 ... for less b/w compat testing. but unless MOCCACAL-77 is fixed, this makes no sense, of course ...  \n13:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I assume that bug is something that need a version dependent fix, but I am just guessing  \n13:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0yeah - anyway no sense in releasing now. When you have time to look into the 7.2 bug would be great. Thanls  \n13:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0otoh, if I cannot fix it this week, just go ahead with the release  \n13:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k - we'll see  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's important to keep the dependency on the LTS which is 6.4.x  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for extensions)  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally Nested Pages shoudn't impact most extensions and if so it's probably easy to fix in a way that also work on 6.4.x  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm interested in knowing what'(s the problem at hand here  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in case we've broken something that we shouldn't have in 7.2)  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ClemensR)  \n13:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, I am curious, too, just had no time to investigate  \n15:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: we were talking about scope creep, seems I have a slide in my deck which addresses it...  \n15:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I forgot about that, \"visions scope the problem you want to solve\"  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah ok, pretty vague :)  \n15:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Well a vision is something like \"all the world's information at your fingertips\"  \n15:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0in which case you make a search engine  \n15:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and not google docs (not if that's your vision)  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends :) you may want to just organize the existing information or contribute to create it  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess if you don't want scope creep then you need a precise vision  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is hard  \n15:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup :)  \n15:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0super hard  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case a single line sentence is not precise neough for sure  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"the best way to organize information\" just scream for scope creep for example :)  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*screams  \n15:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\"the best way to organize your information\" is not a vision because it implies comparisons to other options  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that too  \n15:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it doesn't describe a world  \n15:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\"work better together\" could be a vision, and if it was then we would probably scrap public website related work  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes \"best\" is subjective  \n15:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTte01kdG\\_k  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better is also subjective btw  \n15:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mmm indeed  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better = efficient?  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0= in a fun way?  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0etc  \n15:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0not if you're selecting for 100% employment :D  \n15:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Work Better Together, use \u00a0Paper(tm)  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with this motto, I'd develop telepathy  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Actually \u00a0\"make work fun again\" \u00a0would be a funny slogan  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(mind to mind communication)  \n15:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0because it both contains \"make work\" and an implication that it used to be fun  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes a nice one albeit too general, the domain of work is vast  \n15:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0cjdns vision is routing which isn't so hard to setup, poorly scalable and outdated  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me xwiki is \"a platform for developing collaborative web applications\" which is precise enough but doesn't set limits as what it can do  \n15:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Ok then it's not a publishing platform  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this encompasses content authoring  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is the traditional domain of wikis)  \n15:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but like for a personal blog  \n15:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0non-collaborative  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and actually with this vision, XE is just an example site  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0similar to JDT (Java Eclipse IDE) which is an example of the Eclipse platform  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that I'm talking with my xwiki.org hat here :)  \n15:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think \"collaborative web applications\" is a little bit skewed from the origin of XWiki, basically \u00a0classes, sheets  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically the open source projet should focus on the platform aspect  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0making it possible to users and companies to create end products on top of it, with specific scopes  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki is an application server for me  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but oriented towards providing services related to collaboration  \n15:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Would have to distinguish the vision from that of.. php, ror, etc  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me add one keyword  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"a runtome platform for developing collaborative web applications\"  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*runtime  \n15:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is the big difference  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with ror/php/etc  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you develop inside a live runtime  \n15:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's about morphing applications  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have a slide for this  \n15:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0a platform for mixing your code with the user's data  \n15:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oops nope, that's a bad vision  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0slides 5 and 6 of http://www.slideshare.net/vmassol/xwiki-developing-simple-apps-quickly  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"a runtime platform for developing simple collaborative web applications quickly\"  \n15:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup  \n15:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you're drifting into the \"idea\" space  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0simple and quickly are important too  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this presnetation summarizes this vision: http://www.slideshare.net/vmassol/xwiki-developing-simple-apps-quickly  \n15:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0visions are very user centric. \u00a0A world where you can affordably get anywhere you want to go with just a phone \u00a0\u00a0--> autonamous car  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I've presented it several times already at jugs and it was well accepted)  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't know if you had seen it before  \n15:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0No doubt, Java people will love to see something without the 20 minute compile cycle :P  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0slide 24 shows the pros  \n15:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however we've never been extra clear on xwiki.org about XE vs the platform. We're presenting XE first since it's more user-focused but it could be an error  \n15:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Well the platform approach is \\*a\\* vision, it might not be the one the users want  \n15:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0lots of users like the \"just works\" aspect, even to the point of not bothering to install anything but the .zip and saying \"done\" (in a small team for instance)  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed we have 2 visions in the project  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one is enterprise.xwiki.org  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other is platform.xwiki.org  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for platform I think it's pretty well defined with \"a runtime platform for developing simple collaborative web applications quickly\"  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now for enterprise, it's not clear to me beyond the \"enterprise wiki\"  \n15:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0All of your business information in one place, structured or not.  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note tthat I didn't mention \"wiki\" in the platform vision because I feel the common accepted meaning of the word is restrictive for us  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've used:  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0second generation wiki  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0enterprise wiki  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0application wiki  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0structured wiki  \n15:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0IMO don't worry about restrictive words like wiki, it's an excellent word for hinting at what we're about  \n15:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0bigger risk in explaining correctly what we are and people going \u00a0\"huh?\"  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"a runtime platform for developing simple collaborative web applications quickly, using the wiki paradigm\"  \n15:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0see also: most of academia  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is almost what we say at xwiki.org: \"XWiki offers both a generic platform for developing collaborative applications using the wiki paradigm and projects developed on top of it.\"  \n15:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0we don't want to be in the thneed business (something \"everyone needs\" but is not well defined)  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only problem is that wiki is a connotated word  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki = wikipedia  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n15:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it helps a lot  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not really  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0try explaining xwiki to someone  \n15:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0people know what wikipedia is even if they would get lost in \"structured and unstructured information, linked data, etc\"  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you say  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"you know wikipedia?\"  \n15:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup :)  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then they say \"ah yes xwiki is a encyclopedia\"  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*an  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I say: \u00a0Have you used wikipedia? -> yes \u00a0You know how all of the information is well organized and you can find things? -> yeah \u00a0And you know anyone can edit it and every change is logged in a history? -> oh yeah, that's right \u00a0\u00a0Ok, imagine that for organizing the information inside of your business.  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I do the same but the fact is that it requires explanation  \n15:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0When people have only a \"vague idea\" of what is wikipedia, any handle you can grab is going to help  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I'm in need of some tool to develop an intranet for example, and I see xwiki == wiki == knowledge base  \n15:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If you use only abstract terms, you're going to be there for an hour  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I say to myself: ok that's not for me  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so saying wiki leads to thinking that xwiki is a knowledge base  \n15:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It is, among other things  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but then you loose all the people wanting a collaborative intranet  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for ex)  \n15:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so if you're slick, you say \"everything else you can do, that's the X part\"  \n15:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0what's the diff between a collaborative intranet and a knowledge base ?  \n15:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0social aspect?  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the domain I think  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and the apps ofc)  \n15:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Same thing but re-branded ?  \n15:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0knowledge base is where people are looking for information (more readers), collaborative intranet is where they write their wild ideas to and expect others to read it ;)  \n15:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok so neither of those are really a vision, they're ideas  \n15:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0A vision is \"all of the information in your business is at your fingertips\"  \n15:46\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n15:52\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: how come you're the author of https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/2780a0102e675c36e12d6a08980d7d4b0726d5b4#diff-7bc2a1d22d6526b22159f615775763f3R62 ?
