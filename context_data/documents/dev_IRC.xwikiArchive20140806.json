Where to document such stuff that is too small to be called an extension... i gues...  \n15:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Small extensions are still welcome  \n15:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but if you don't want to publish it as a XAR extension (which would be preferable because it could be installed with extension manager) you still have the option of installing as a snippet  \n15:59\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0Okay, so just document them a l\u00e1 snippet style on extensions.xwiki.org ?  \n16:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0err s/installing/publishing/  \n16:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's not the best but it's ok  \n16:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if it's just one page with a unique name, it should be fine  \n16:01\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0ok, with or without a sapce for it?  \n16:02\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0\\*space  \n16:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if it's many pages in the XWiki space or pages with names that might collide with usernames, you might consider porting it to it's own space  \n16:02\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0two pages  \n16:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0on the other hand, we'd rather have a pretty good extension than none at all :)  \n16:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so use good judgement  \n16:02\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0a oen space it is  \n16:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and making a .xar file and publishing on extensions.xwiki.org benefits you too because you can install it on another wiki in the future using just the extension manager  \n16:03\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0alright, i will do just so  \n16:04\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0how to create a config page for an extension so the users dont have to edit the macro?  \n16:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise2xCycle#HEasierdevelopmentofconfigurableapplicationsusingXWiki.ConfigurableClass  \n16:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration+Application#HMakingyourapplicationeasilyconfigurablewithConfigurableClass28SinceEnterprise2.3M129  \n16:06\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0yeah!  \n16:06\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0thanks alot  \n16:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sure thing  \n16:18\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:41\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n16:53\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:44\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<sdumitriu2>\u00a0has quit  \n17:51\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:29\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:30\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n21:31\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n23:16\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
