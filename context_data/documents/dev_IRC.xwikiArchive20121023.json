Also I'm wondering why we don't have more screenshots showing off the great feature of workspaces?  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: wait 2 mn, I'll reimport the extension first  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: done  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: gallery is failing for me, is it ok for you?  \n17:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: looking into it  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: if oyu make a change to the extension app you need to tell tmortagne  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's going to be removed next time we update it  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in other words it needs to be committed in platform)  \n17:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, that`s a rather annoying thing :)  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: actually the best is to update it on github, not need to ask me  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: sure but here I'm not sure if what Enygma` has done is correct  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m just testing  \n17:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so why isn`t it ok to do a $doc.display('description') in view mode?  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure I'm just indicating that for bugfixes and valid stuff there is no need to wait for me to do it  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that'll bring HTML Enygma`  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which means toc macro will not find anything among other things  \n17:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, so then how do we execute the velocity in the description?  \n17:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since nested macros are not allowed  \n17:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0do we do a dirty #eval ?  \n17:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the real fix would be to add support for object in {{display}} macro  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm actually surprised that we don't have that many people trying stuff on playground....  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's why I didn't filter it btw, was curious to see the traffic and what people are doing there\u2026 :))  \n17:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: maybe it`s not advertised enough  \n17:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0as an alternative to the download  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed Enygma`, good idea  \n17:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so any idea about the ExtensionSheet problem? Basically, right now, we are not allowing velocity inside extension descriptions.  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: are you up for improving the download pages to add some information at the top like: explain the various options for testing XE, XEM, etc: \u00a0- playground, - download, - myxwiki.org, link to the professional support for XWiki Cloud ? :)  \n17:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: right now I don't have time to do that, and I'm not sure where you want all that information to appear, since our download pages contain already lots of text. Maybe on the http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DownloadCode/DownloadFeedback page  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would need to come before  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because the idea is to let the user know all the possibilities he has to test xwiki  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if he downloads it, it's too late  \n17:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0how about a page in the carousel ?  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0th problem  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that right now you quickly see the download button  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but once you've clicked it's too late  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so another idea would be to rename \"Download\" to \"Get XWiki\"  \n17:39\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I don't see no problem in this - giving the user what he needs in the first place, instead of advertising  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then have a page that explains hte different ways  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0advertising?  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0err?  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he wants to try xwiki  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he doesn't want to download it  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but rightnow  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he doesn't even know there are other ways  \n17:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: fixed the Workspace Application page, manually.  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we're probably loosing some users  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who don't want to go through the hassle of installing it  \n17:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0how about in the Carousel to have 2 buttons, one is Download the other is \"try XWiki\"  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so just for XE and not for the other other ones?  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0won't work  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because what happens is that users can arrive from a search, from a reference  \n17:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0re playground, maybe \"demo\" would have been a better and easier to understand name instead of \"playground\"  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and they'll have the download button on the right  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but they won't see the carrousel  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's only on the home page  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so having 2 buttons on the carroussel is ok  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not sure it's enough  \n17:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0on the other pages - they still have the Menu entries from the Downlaod & Play  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: that's way less visible than the download button  \n17:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ok than on the other pages, have just like the Download button panel, another button panel with the Try  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I'm fine with Demo too  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: yes if that's not too overloaded, I'm fine but where would it go  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?

 \n17:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the testing options ...  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure I can propose something  \n17:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0if I know how many options we have \u2026 I can make them look good together  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: maybe something like: https://gist.github.com/3939590  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm still not sure how to advertise XWiki Cloud\u2026 Denis1/AndreasJonsson, if you have some idea, I'm keen to discuss them with you  \n17:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: I'll think about a page to display that text  \n17:56\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n17:57\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: IMO, you should advertise it on the Support page, in the services provided by XWiki SAS, no ?  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: yes, but the idea here is to show all the ways you can get started quickly with XWiki  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would make XWiki Cloud less visible  \n18:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: but you refer professional services, no ?  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is a pity since there's a free plan which is nice to try it out  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(even if you have no intent of buying anything)  \n18:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: you may explicit the professional services, saying some provides free cloud hosting ;) but mentionning XWiki Cloud with a direct link, will not display all professional offers, which is IMO not fair  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0said differently ATM we only have the support page which aggregates everything. Maybe we need to dissociate this blob and separate into different offers: services, cloud, etc  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes this is why I'm asking  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm trying to make it fair while not hiding stuff that would benefit the user from seing  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seeing  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll think more about it  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have some idea  \n18:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I do not feel splitting is good, it will be more difficult for the user to have an overview  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not what I mean  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's like ATM we have only 1 method, the idea is to have several methods which can be called from more \u00a0places in xwiki.org  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's still possible to have one place with all the offers from a company  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can even have a CompanyClass  \n18:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with different objects/properties  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so for example if your company has a way to download some custom packaging of \u00a0XWiki you would mention it in the prop and it would be listed automaitcally  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just an example)  \n18:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I would be ok with any solution, where all commercial offer (including free one) are shown for all company at the same time, this is IMO the most fair way to work this out. I do not see why .org would host more details, since company website will.  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well its a bit like myxwiki.org  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we show it  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even though it's paid, managed by xwiki sas  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this case I find it nice for users to nkow that xwiki cloud exists  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the same if your company offers some disitributions  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's a good info for theuser instead of having to go to each company home page and try to find his way  \n18:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0myxwiki.org is part of the opensource project, I am not saying XWiki SAS should not have the best place, but only that I want user be aware several company provides services, before choosing any services from one of them  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yesI agree  \n18:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what I'm proposing :)  \n18:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this does not require going to the home of each company, since the support page has a resume of services provided by each company  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if one company offers a way to buy/test xwiki it should be listed there  \n18:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yes, along with other offer of each company  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now if your company offers only support there's no reason it should be listed on the get it page  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/ get it / try  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that company would already be listed in the support page  \n18:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am not sure, not providing an on line, easy access, does not means we do not provide xwiki deployments, just we do it more manually  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I never said online  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again  \n18:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you said support is not get it and try  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if your company provides a way to Try xwiki, it would be listed  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're talking about the \"Try\"' page here  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not sure you followed the start of the discussion\u00e0  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0)  \n18:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you could try XWiki with us, it is just not as easy as your online offer  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i'll send some proposal on the list  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that we can discuss it there  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(after some more thinking)  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0ok  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks for the input  \n18:20\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0I have this clirr report \"com.xpn.xwiki.tool.backup.ImportMojo: Field MPNAME\\_DESCRIPTION has been removed, but it was previously a constant\" but I cannot find any related exclude :|  \n18:21\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ah, this should be the maven plugin so not really related to APIs... removing the line from the report  \n18:33\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0what do I put in tested browsers and manual test report for 4.3M1?  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: should fill this actually  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/://  \n18:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0latest FF version  \n18:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0sorry, can't do it now  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you tested it sburjan?  \n18:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0not fully  \n18:40\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0latest FF release is 16.0.1 - putting that  \n18:40\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0for the manual test report I have no link ATM  \n18:42\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0fmancinelli: remove the manual test report header  \n18:42\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ok  \n18:42\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0that is used only for post-RC1 - final versions  \n18:43\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0I see. ok removed  \n18:43\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0I think the release notes a ready.
