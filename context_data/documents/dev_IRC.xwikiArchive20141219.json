 \n13:52\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I don't understand this: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki64M3#HWikiConfiguration  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it syas:  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"A new \"Configuration > Wiki\" section is added in Administration \"  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but there was already a \"Wiki\" section  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and from the screenshot it doesn't look like it contains the info from the other ones  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we probably have a naming issue  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually just checked and the existing one is \"Wikis\"  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO the names are too close  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe they should be grouped together if the code is in the same module  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(xwiki-platform-wiki)  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0not really the same thing  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0one is the configuration of the current wiki  \n14:00\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are 3 domains  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0descriptor, template and rights  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0spread into 2 sections ATM  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0template and rights have not more in common than the descirptor with the rest  \n14:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you can`t group them into a single section  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could have a Wiki category  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with 3 sections  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0probbaly  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*probably  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the current section that I`ve added is consistent to what existed in Workspaces and with the notion of Configuring \u00a0your wiki  \n14:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*current wiki  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well everything is about configuration  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the configruation category has no sense for me  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could be called General instead  \n14:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0might not be a bad idea  \n14:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or could be removed and better categories found to group sections together by domain  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0email has been moved out laready  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki could go in a wiki category  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now that we have ability to register categories  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to review all the sections in the Applications category anyway  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like Search and Search Suggest should probably be grouped  \n14:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0of course, all of this is very new and we can`t expect old stuff to use it :)  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and \"Applications\" should probably be renamed as \"Others\" or \"Miscellaneous\"  \n14:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, was thinking about that  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: it's not hard to refazctor them  \n14:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since it does not make sense to keep Apps anymore  \n14:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yep, not hard  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone will need to make a proposal at some point :)  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway right now you maybe we can jsut have \"Wiki Descriptor\" instead of \"wiki\"?  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would it make sense?  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or do you think  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no problem with the \"Wikis\" existing section  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure why that one is plural actually  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway we can tune this later, provided we do it before 6.4 final  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just food for thoughts I guess  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I don't want to hassle you before you leave for holidays ;))  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0well, as I`ve mentioned, my logic was, in the current context, that it makes sense when you view it as \"Configuration > Wiki\", like the most basic stuff you have to configure on a wiki  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0analogy with when you create a new wiki  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0pretty name, description, owner and such  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the exising wikis application was separate and it handled completely different stuff so I did not consider it a problem  \n14:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but I agree with reviewing and improving the categories/sections for sure  \n14:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and it would be awesome if, at some point we would have the wiki rights in the proper rights section :)  \n14:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0instead of them being separate as now  \n14:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but until then, we`ll do with what we have  \n14:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0a jira issue would be useful  \n14:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah, one thing about the new additions to ConfigurableClass...  \n14:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0there is no ordering on the sections within a category  \n14:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so we risk having them under different orders across wikis/installations  \n14:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0just as we have an order hint for categories, I think we should have one for sections too  \n14:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0as an improvement of what we have right now  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry was otp, rading  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*reading  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes on the order topic there are improvements to make  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding ordering  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a simple solution would be to order alphabetically the sections with in a category  \n14:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit

older Xwiki 3.5 instance to a newer version. \u00a0Should I attempt to upgrade to the latest stable, or upgrade to a 4.x first, 5.x then attempt 6?  \n18:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0backup the database :)  \n18:23\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0Oh for sure :))  \n18:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0then check the release notes for each major version between the most recent and your version  \n18:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0then install the most recent version and prepare to do some significant waiting, it does some significant DB migration (check the 4.0 release notes for more information about this)  \n18:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0start it up, watch the log and have a coffee  \n18:25\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0Thanks for the advice!  \n18:25\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0I found http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/Archives so I'll go over that.  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the main issue you can have I think is if you had stats enabled and there are some corrupted stats data in your db  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(corrupted = duplicate entries)  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway you should try it and if you have problems ping us here or on the list  \n18:26\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0I also have some custom auth components, and a tempfiles component that I had written for 3.5.. I think some of those used oldcore I suppose that's gone now ? :)  \n18:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hrm ReleaseNodes/Archive is not updated  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still there :)  \n18:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SpaceIndex?space=ReleaseNotes#|t=spaceindex&p=1&l=15&s=doc.date&d=desc  \n18:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0this has all of them  \n18:27\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0:))  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it \\*is\u00a8\\* udpated  \n18:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you need to read the minor versions but not the point versions, so 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 but not 4.3.1, 4.3.2 etc  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's all the archives  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the recent ones are here: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/  \n18:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh ok  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now it's time to move some more to archives probably  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0moving the 5.x ones now  \n18:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0would be cool to have a little app to say \"I'm upgrading from $X to $Y, give me all of the release notes I need to care about\"  \n18:28\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0glad I could be of service! :)  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: hehe  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I had speced this idea and proposed it already  \n18:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I even started working on it at some point  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but didn't finish  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wanted that too  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my idea was a Release Notes app  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably somewhere on the list  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or in jira  \n18:30\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0I had myself signed up for the mailing list, but I think I had to cut it off because of the traffic :) \u00a0\u00a0So I've been out of the loop for a while..  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0users is not high I think  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0devs is...  \n18:30\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0It was devs :)  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you were brave :)  \n18:33\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0After a while my brain started to melt and you guys had moved a version or two ahead anyways. heh  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hope you'll like the changes from 3.5 to 6.4 :)  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0quite a few ;)  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially the new skin  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll jump one or 2 skins ;)  \n18:34\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0heh, yea I was looking at the current version number and the release notes it looks quite nice!  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR 6.4M2 was just released today and the final 6.4 is planned for mid Jan  \n18:35\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0Ok, maybe I'll aim for 6.4..  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the end of the 6.x cycle so 6.4 is a good bet  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(meaning it's stable)  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting beginning of Jan we're going to start work for 7.x  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting with 7.0  \n18:36\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0Was there work done on the XWikiAuthServiceImpl to make it easier to do external authorization? \u00a0I think when I checked last it was quite hard..  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the extensions have improved a lot too  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you won't see them in the release notes for XWiki, they each have their own release notes on extensions.xwiki.org  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think XWikiAuthServiceImpl has changed  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do have a lot more authenticators probably  \n18:38\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0Or not neccessarily that one, but I think it had some special sauce that wasn't as easily re-implementable for other AbstractXWikiAuthService  \n18:40\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0I think I just ended up hacking a sync upon logon to grab current authorizations for my external source and update them in XWiki's native ones  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check https://github.com/orgs/xwiki-contrib/dashboard and search for \"authenticator\" in the search box  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are some and if you can check their source code  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in case you need that)  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our auth expert (thomas) is not connected right now but if you have a question he's your man ;)  \n18:40\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0Ok, that's great thanks for letting me pick your brain :)  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and send us an email once you've done the uprgade to tell us what you like/don't like!  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need input for XWiki 7.x  \n18:41\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0Thanks, I will!  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n18:43\u00a0<Old\\_Xwikier>\u00a0!jira 1344  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0come on xwiki bot you can't count up to 4! :)  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you were looking for XWIKI-1344 ?
