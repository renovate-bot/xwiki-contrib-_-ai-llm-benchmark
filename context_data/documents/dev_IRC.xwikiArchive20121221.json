Any clue?  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0GuillaumeF: it's Extension Manager  \n11:55\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I thought it was two different things  \n11:55\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0thanks  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not yet  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and what you are going to report has probably a lot more to do with EM that DW  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/that/than/  \n11:57\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0no, it's about DW usability :-)  \n11:57\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0ease of use if you want  \n11:58\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0GuillaumeF: I reported the one about XEM conflicts  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's EM GuillaumeF  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's the same problem in the EM UI  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and DW reuses EM UI  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for your UC)  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which I happen to know of ;))  \n11:59\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I see, but I want to report about the fact that you can be blocked for hours, without seeing that a document is in conflict, when you are is hided details mode  \n11:59\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0ok ok  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah there are 2 issues  \n12:00\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0For developers and people that knows how works DW, it's ok, but for an user that don't usually clicks on \"Show Details\", it's not that simple  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one is about the closing logs  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea was supposed to have fixed it but it's still there  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ?  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: when you log in, and you come back to the DW screen the \"show details\" logs is closed and the user needs to click to open it again  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other is about merge conflcit not visible at the bottom of logs  \n12:01\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0you mean that you have to scroll down, right?  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n12:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0GuillaumeF: which version?  \n12:01\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a04.3.1  \n12:02\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I can report both of them if you want  \n12:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: when you come back the details are expanded  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you sure?  \n12:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, I fixed it  \n12:02\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I can try again to be sure  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: it seems GuillaumeF had to click  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he's on 4.3.1  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I also remember this (but not 100% sure on my side)  \n12:03\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0let me try again, maybe I hide it by myself without paying too much attention  \n12:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0GuillaumeF: I don't know you did exactly, wdym by \"hidden details mode\"?  \n12:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if you collapsed the details yourself then it's normal  \n12:04\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0that the \"Show Details\" section is not expanded  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: can you confirm that it was the case for you too?  \n12:06\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0The only thing that I'm sure, is that if you're in the hidden details mode (details section not expanded), whatever I clicked on \"hide details\" or not, the section won't be expanded \u00a0when the conflict occurs.  \n12:08\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0Let me confirm everything I said :-)  \n12:08\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0(or refute)  \n12:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0GuillaumeF: the EM shows you the progress tab (and thus the conflict) when the page is loaded, if there is progress or a conflict. Now, if after the page is loaded, and during the install, you switch to a different tab (say dependencies or description) or if you click on Hide Details, the EM won't show you the conflict because you \\_choose\\_ to hide the details or to look at a different tab  \n12:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I get BY DEFAULT (without doing antything) that section EXPANDED. After the modal and Admin login, I still have that expanded. What is hard to see there is the merge. You have to scroll down to see the merge issue. Because if you don't scroll down, yuou'll keep looking at the progress bar and wonder why it's stuck  \n12:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0(at least on my resolution, I am connected via RDP)  \n12:15\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0IMO, whenever a conflict appears, the section should expand automatically, even if the person clicked on Hide  \n12:17\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0either directly in progress tab, or showing there is a conflict by another mean. Idk  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree, you could create an improvement request for this  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I had the same issue as you, waiting for DW/EM to finish and not knowing there was a conflcit and I had to click somewhere  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tihink we've all had it  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(except maybe marius/thomas ;))  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's because DW don't like you  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I like it  \n12:20\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0BTW, DW is a very great improvement. I know that you're working on it for a long time, but I only used it a couple of time, and I'm curious to see how it will be better to upgrade wikis with the help of it.  \n12:20\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0(I can't come here and only complaining :p )  \n12:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0guys, I agree about scrolling down to the conflict \\_if\\_ you are on the progress tab, but otherwise, if you chosen to look at a different tab or to hide the details then this is you choice.  \n12:22\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0So at least a non intrusive message could remind that a conflict has been detected  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: as GuillaumeF said what's important is that you know there's a conflict  \n12:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm fine with this, and I talked with Caty about doing some CSS trick to \"highlight\" the progress tab when there is a conflict and you are on a differnt tab  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whatever the mean  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be some read flashing thing  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*red  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or a modal dialog box popping up with \"conflict found, with the detail and the choice to make\"  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/\"//  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or anyting else  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0provided the user knows there's a conflict and is told what to do  \n12:25\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0Unless you want to show something like that ( http://www.omfgdogs.com/ ) I'm ok with any warning  \n14:30\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n14:31\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n14:50\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: hi  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is this an important bug fix? is it dangerous? I'm asking because 4.4 is a stabilization release and we're not allowed to put anything risky in it  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks like a pretty large commit  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thus risky and dangerous  \n15:24\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0It is the work in feature-authorization-context. \u00a0It is definitely an important bug fix, but also risky.  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're very close to 4.4RC1 now  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm a bit worried by the commit that nobody else aprart from you has any knowledge about  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also christmas time and I don't know if committers/you will be around to fix any issue that may arise before the release of Thursday  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: I really think this should be pushed to 5.0  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a04.4 and 4.5 are stailization releases only  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this looks like too large a change for 4.4/4.5  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a04.5 is supposed to be released at end of january  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: should this commit be only in https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/feature-authorization-context branch ?  \n15:28\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0I squashed it into one commit.  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what do others think? am I wrong to worry?  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the ci log is a merge of all your commits ?  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I agree with vmassol that it's not a minor change that you merged and it's probably a bit short for 4.4  \n15:29\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0There were some changes back and forth in the branch, so I thought it would be better to squash it for easier code review.  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure it's not really the issue :)  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just talking about introducing big changes that late in 4.4 branch  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since 4.4/4.5 are mostly big RCs for 4.x branch  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe this should wait 5.0, WDYT ?  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at the very minimum it requires a vote to merge now on master  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: if you really think it should go in the 4.x cycle I'd suggest you send a vote.

A vote is mandatory for voting in new committers or from removing committers. It's not necessary to send a vote when performing minor or even sometimes substantial modifications provided the author judges everyone would agree to them. This is called lazy consensus.
