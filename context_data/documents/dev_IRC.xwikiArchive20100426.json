However if it must be done, I think it's best to have a configuration parameter specify the page.  \nsdumitriu - (20:13): jvelociter: New patch looks good  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:13): I think the best thing to do in such a case is to have the page somehow register itself with checkAccess.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:15): If a wiki is closed can't a page still explicitly allow XWikiGuest view access?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:16): Never mind...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:23): I think \"prevent unregistered users from viewing...\" is a misguided concept (I know this doesn't solve our problem). \u00a0When I give Alice authority to view a page, I have implicitly given that authority to anyone who Alice wishes to permit and anyone who they permit.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:25): If Alice wishes to transfer her view authority to Bob she may simply load the page and transfer the content to him.  \nlucaa left at 20:28 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsdumitriu - (20:28): We can't prevent active user disclosure  \nsdumitriu - (20:29): Bob could even look over Alice's shoulder, how could we prevent that :D  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:29): We have to rely on Alice to have her security in order (mirror on the monitor) :D  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:30): So I think the permissions 2.0 system should be look more toward permissions as objects which are passed from user to user.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:31): But for now I would think the best approach is to have a configuration parameter for permissions which are allowed over all else.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:32): Maybe just pages which must be visible to guests.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:34): This actually applies to the invitation application as well.  \nsdumitriu - (20:36): Yes  \nDenis - (20:39): sdumitriu: I have comment XWIKI-5143  \nDenis - (20:41): CalebJamesDeLisl: you should close XWIKI-4755, no ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:41): Yes. jv said that earlier. Thanks for bugging me about it, I can be forgetful.  \nsdumitriu - (20:41): Denis: Do you have something working for XWIKI-929?  \nDenis - (20:44): sdumitriu: no, we work around XWIKI-929 since long by doing ugly test in XWiki class  \nDenis - (20:45): XWIKI-4378 is part of them  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:47): I'm not a big fan of XWIKI-929 because I worry about permissions creap. What purpose does a register or programming right on a particular document serve?  \nDenis - (20:49): What I said, is that I prefer not to loose time being nice for fixing those, since the nice thing to do is rewrite the rights system from scratch. We have to thought about it deeply, and have a proper backward compatibility feature as well  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:50): IMO there are 2 permissions: read and write. and three possible settings (allow, deny, and defer) And there should be a cascade/restrict bit to decide of that permit can be overridden. \u00a0I also see the point about writing nice code in hacksville.  \nDenis - (20:53): not sure it is so simple, delete permission is nice to have  \nDenis - (20:53): and, obviously we will need better handling between content, object, attachement, and so on  \nDenis - (20:54): and at the same time, it have to be simple  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:54): I beleve the only way to keep the 2.0 database driver from turning into a jungle is to make everything extend a single entity (like object).  \nDenis - (20:55): so it not simple, and will require a long discussion, and it is not the time for that right now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:56): Sure, the reason I said that is if there was one object then each thing would be able to be referenced with permissions.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:57): I think I agree with you about delete permission because only delete allows one to actually drop data from the database.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:59): But of course programming, register, undelete etc. should not make it to the 2.0 permission manager.  \nvenkatesh left at 21:30 (  \nannacondan left at 21:36 (Quit: annacondan  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 21:42  \ngvallarelli joined #xwiki at 22:00  \ngvallarelli - (22:00): good evening  \nsdumitriu - (22:01): Hi  \nsdumitriu - (22:01): So, what's the news gvallarelli?  \ngvallarelli - (22:01): life goes on  \ngvallarelli - (22:01): that's the news ^^  \ngvallarelli - (22:02): sdumitriu: like XWiki I'm not selected this year  \nsdumitriu - (22:02): Well, life goes on, as you said  \ngvallarelli - (22:02): as you said sdumitriu  \nsdumitriu - (22:02): Sorry for you, but don't get too depressed over it  \ngvallarelli - (22:03): sdumitriu: thank you, I can contribute to XWiki  \ngvallarelli - (22:08): sdumitriu: but I have to organize my time because I will work with a professor for a thesis  \ngvallarelli - (22:08): but in my spare time I can contribute  \njvelociter left at 22:20 (Quit: jvelociter  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 22:21  \njvelociter left at 22:21 (Client Quit  \ngvallarelli - (22:50): got to go  \ngvallarelli - (22:50): goodnight  \ngvallarelli left #xwiki at 22:50  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 23:09  \nanamarias left at 23:28 (Quit: anamarias  \nmflorea left at 23:39 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvdrean left at 23:45 (Quit: Leaving.  \n\n"}
