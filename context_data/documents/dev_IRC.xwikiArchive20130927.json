Before, 5.2M2 the editor wasn't loaded at all (because the Velocity IF with $services.wysiwyg.isSyntaxSupported was failing silently). Now that you added the deps the script service is loaded correctly and it says yes, the syntax is supported and thus we try to load the editor but we fail because resources are missing.  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which resources are missing?  \n09:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the packager plugin specifies only the wysiwyg-server dep because it is needed in web.xml  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but not the resources  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0js file  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0which is fine  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the packeager is supposed to provide a wysiwyg ready XWiki instance  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to fix the issue  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it shouldn't  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what it does now  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0)  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0nop  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise I wouldn't load any wyssiwyg stuff  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0as I said before  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0marius, I coded it  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know what I wanted to achieve  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0let me explain please  \n09:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the only reason the packer plugin has a dep on WYSIWYG is because our web.xml has a filter and a servlet defined in the wysiwyg-server jar  \n09:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so it needs to bring the wsowyg-server to be able to deploy the webapp  \n09:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but it doesn't have to bring the wysowyg editor js code because wiki needs to work without the wysiwyg editor  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so let's forget what I did want to achieve in the past and focus on what we want now  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so  \n09:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and I just fixed macros.vm which was expecting the wysiwyg editor to be present all the time which was wring  \n09:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0wrong  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I'm in a test that needs wysiwyg what dep do I need to add?  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep that's wrong indeed  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which ties to the discussion of yesterday with GD which we need to bring to the list I think  \n09:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in this \\_edge\\_ case you need to add a dep to the wysowyg-war as it is done in wysowyg-tests in platform  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not really edge...  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at all  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0functional tests MUST do exactly as the user would see  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie they should ALWAYS have the wysiwyg  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0except for some edge cases  \n09:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's the role of the wysowyg tests  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when we want to test the special case when the user has disabled the wysiwyg  \n09:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you don't test the editor  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which never happens)  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is NOT the point  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0these are \\*\\*functional\\*\\* tests  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they MUST  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*\\*MUST\\*\\*  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0be with the same environment as the user  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we want to be sure they work  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we think this has a cost?  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0enough to justify not having it  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for unit tests I prefectly agree with you  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0OR  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we consider those integration tests and we still need additional functional tests  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me give you one example  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0imagine that the FAQ app is forcing the wiki editor (but it doesn't do it voluntrarily)  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the tests will pass  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but when the user uses the FAQ app  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he'll get the wiki editor  \n09:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vincent, I understand all you are saying  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whereas he'd expect the wysiwyg one  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we wouldn't have noticed it  \n09:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in this case you write a test \u00a0for it!  \n09:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it different  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you cannot think about that  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just too hard  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this case you write  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a test  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to verify you have the top level menu too  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and multiply this by 100 to verify everything  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0while here in the the current FAQ test  \n09:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: what you are saying about the WYSIWYG is the opposite of what we do when creating a minimal runtime with only what the application need to work, nobody ever do that  \n09:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if we follow 100% what your are saying we move back all those tests to XE  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no because  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the FAQ doesn't interact with a lot of other apps/modules  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we don't need those  \n09:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm just going to say that for me the FAQ has nothing to do with the WYSIWYG editor and thus it shouldn't have to require it  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it does interact with the WYSIWYG  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as almost all apps)  \n09:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if you want it then add the dep on wysowyg war on faw tests  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wich is why I was asking which dep we need to add in the func test to add the wysiwyg if we don't put it by defaukt  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if a application require the WYSIWYG then that application should depend on it but the WYSIWYG should not be in the default package  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I definitely agree with thomas  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: with this reasoning the packager plugin's pom.xml should be empty  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now it's a pity that an application really require the WYSIWYG  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not that it requires it  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just that it should work with and without it  \n09:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0there's no app that requires the wysiwyg editor!  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's much better to test with it  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0than without  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becauase that's what the user will use  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and again the goal of a functional test is to verify that what the user will do will work  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: well yes the packager plugin pom.xml should be empty ideally since the goal is to test with only what is needed by the application, if the application does not need something I don't really see why we put it in the package  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I agree except if it makes writing func tests too hard  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we jsut should be careful it stays reasonable  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes with flavors it'll be better  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because the func testw ill be able to depend on a \"base\" flavor  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: what dep do I nee to add?  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the wysiwyg war?  \n09:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I believe I said it twice :)  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes I missed the \"war\" part  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0flavors won't change anything to these tests, you can still declare all the dependencies you need in an application and depending on a flavor in an application is very wrong for me  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I strongly disagree  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because I'm not going to add 100 deps in every func test  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's bad  \n09:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: check xwiki-platform-wysiwyg-tests  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I think we all agree in the end  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't need 100 deps  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: did oyu change the FAQ test code?  \n09:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no, why?  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm surpsied it works the same with and withjout the wysiwyg editor  \n09:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the test was written to work with no WYSIWYG :)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not really  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wrote it  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I didn't think about this  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's luck  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but good  \n09:53\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the way you set the answer content is made to work with plain text area  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what happened I think is just that the wysiwyg wasn't loading  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I coded the tets to work with the wiki editor  \n09:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, and I said this above  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I've never tried this app on a full XE  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've only tested it on xwiki.org but I don't have the wysiwyg editor there either  \n09:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0again, the application has nothing to do with the wysiwyg editor  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because my user has plain text forced \u00a0on xwiki.org  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(text)  \n09:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the application doesn't even know there is a wysiwyg editor  \n09:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and this is true for almost all applications  \n09:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0normally  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you tell me we need wysiwyg client in packager plugin?  \n09:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0applications just display their fields in a form and xwiki takes care of loading the wysiwyg editor  \n09:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0wysiwyg-server depends on wysiwyg-client  \n09:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(for the service interfaces)  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I have to go for the roadmap meeting  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you document the deps on wysiwyg in the pom marius to explain why there's there?  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*they're there  \n09:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0isn't this already documented?  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and verify we only have the minimal deps for wysiwyg (nothing extra that we could drop)  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n09:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n09:59\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n10:15\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:21\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:31\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n10:38\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:02\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: good morning. do you remember at which version of XWiki we put in the RN that you have to delete the old index dir because SOLR was getting stuck at indexing ?
