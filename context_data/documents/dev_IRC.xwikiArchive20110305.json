I'm asking because LiveTableElement currently has a very hackish way to determine if the livetable has been loaded.  \n11:24\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0hmm I don't really recall when is \"xwiki-livetable-loader\" class removed, at the beginning or end of the loading entries process  \n11:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok. thanks, \u00a0then I'll take a look over the code  \n11:39\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi rendering is now depending only on commons modules  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and thus can be released - after commons is released)  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a039s to build commons, that's cool  \n12:24\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:55\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:02\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:19\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:51\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:14\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:16\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n17:21\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n17:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:10\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:21\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:56\u00a0<florinciu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:56\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
