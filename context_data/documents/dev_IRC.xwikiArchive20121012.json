(sorry, I'm not an XWiki user and I guess it's not obvious to me)  \n00:30\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0should be an edit button in the upper left  \n00:30\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0or just rename the url from /bin/view/Your/Document to \u00a0/bin/edit/Your/Document?editor=wiki  \n00:32\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0It's actually and extension and it looks like that may be different... \u00a0Can I give you the path I use to get to the error?  \n00:32\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0I go to the main wiki page  \n00:32\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ok  \n00:32\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0Click on the \"Reader\" \"space\"  \n00:32\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0I choose \"Administer Space\"  \n00:33\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0oh, that's not very helpful, the URL might give me a clue  \n00:33\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0And then in the bottom left there is a \"Applications --> \u00a0Reader\" menu/link  \n00:33\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0oh, cool, here it is: http://xwiki-25648-tonyduck2.app.standingcloud.com/xwiki/bin/admin/Reader/WebPreferences?editor=spaceadmin&space=Reader&section=Reader  \n00:36\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0mm hard to say... the piece of code which is failing looks ok, maybe something in WebPreferences was altered at some point  \n00:37\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0perhaps check the activity stream for changes to internal documents  \n00:38\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0Could it be related to the site starting out on an unstable version? \u00a0The site was started on milestone 4.2 milestone 1 and then later upgraded to 4.2 stable (after this extension was already installed)...  \n00:40\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0usually anything that serious is caught in an automated test but upgrading tends to be painful and extensions are still pretty new  \n00:41\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0okay, thank you, I will look at the activity stream as you suggested and go from there  \n00:41\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0thanks again for your help, have a good day/night :-)  \n00:43\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0you too  \n00:43\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0best of luck  \n00:55\u00a0<technickal\\_nick>\u00a0has quit  \n02:02\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n02:46\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n04:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n05:02\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n05:03\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n06:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n07:34\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n08:15\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:27\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n08:36\u00a0<coud5>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:37\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:31\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:32\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n09:42\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:11\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:41\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n11:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n12:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n12:44\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:44\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n12:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:43\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:43\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0hi  \n13:43\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Is xwiki better than mediawiki?

:)  \n13:56\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, I'm using mediawiki, and I don't like the fact that it doesn't support per-page ACL.  \n13:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you have precise question like this we can answer, in that case XWiki support page based ACL yes  \n13:58\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, Can you provide me with an example of a website using XWiki?  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crocket: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/References/  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have a lot there  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that XWiki is much more than a wiki  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's also a development platform  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you can do pretty much anything with it  \n14:00\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, Does XWiki display using only JSP?  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we generally don't use JSP  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we use mostly Velocity  \n14:01\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Velocity?  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you can also use Groovy, Python, Ruby, etc...  \n14:01\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0never heard of it  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Velocity is a templating language  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a very simple language  \n14:01\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, XWiki doesn't seem to have a definite shape.  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have a default skin  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you can completely change it  \n14:02\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, I mean the UI.  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the default skin is pretty much what you have on xwiki.org itself  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I know what you mean :)  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in what we call a \"skin\" in XWiki you can modify the whole UI  \n14:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crocket: a good thing to start testing XWiki is to download the all in one hsqldb/jetty package  \n14:04\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, hsqldb?  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a embedded database  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://hsqldb.org/  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we usually use MySQL in production but XWiki works with variouus databases  \n14:07\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n14:07\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, Does XWiki use Velocity to render pages?  \n14:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crocket: yes  \n14:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well mostly  \n14:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but in a page you can use various other scripting languages  \n14:10\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, \"The built-in search of mediawiki looks up pages by name.\"  \n14:10\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Does XWiki do it, too?  \n14:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the default search search everywhere (page name, page content, attachments, etc.)  \n14:11\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0how about email address encryption?  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you mean ?  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by default in a user profile the email address does not shows up complete  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it can't be used by a robot if that's your question  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but the user profile like everything can be \u00a0customized  \n14:14\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, robots  \n14:38\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:39\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, Which execution environment do you recommend?  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we usually use Tomcat  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you plan to install it on a Debian based system you should look at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationViaAPT  \n15:25\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0hmm  \n15:42\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:43\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n15:47\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:08\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:18\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:55\u00a0<coud5>\u00a0hi, does someone use SVN Application extension ?
