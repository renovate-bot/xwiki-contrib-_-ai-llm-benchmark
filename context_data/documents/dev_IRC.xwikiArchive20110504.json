Best if we can write their presentation for them.  \n10:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Should we mention that after the long 1.0 release, the release frequency went up with around 5 major releases per year?  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or a relese every 2-3 months  \n10:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I looked at the history page for mediawiki and it was very short so I removed a lot of the history I had been writing.  \n10:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I intend to expand on these things in sections. One thing I was somewhat worried about is not to include too many things about style which, while impressive to a developer may not be impressive to someone who is doing wikiresearch for a presentation.  \n10:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0My goal is to make that presentation the easiest thing they ever did :)  \n10:16\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:35\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:04\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:11\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm doing the javadoc now, all that's left is wikimatrix which you said you'd do, freshmeat, and \"ANN Mail\"  \n11:11\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:11\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:18\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has quit  \n11:43\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Is it normal for JBoss AS to take several minutes to startup?  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think so...  \n12:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's busy looking inside jars  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember it was taking time before  \n12:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The only jar that's causing problems is jackrabbit-core-1.1-xwiki.jar  \n12:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0What's weird is that I don't find any other jar that it's overriding  \n12:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0JBoss doesn't include jackrabbit  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jackrabbit is in tomcat isn't it?  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you sure?  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm probably wrong  \n12:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I can't find tomcat inside JBoss either...  \n12:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Freshmeat Wikimatrix \u00a0ANN Mail \u00a0\u00a0<-- I have no permission to the first 2 and I have no idea what #3 is  \n12:27\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0cjdelisle: ANN Mail you sent already  \n12:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Announcement mail  \n12:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Doing freshmeat and WM  \n12:29\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh then that's been done since the exectuables were finished  \n12:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol did WikiMatrix  \n12:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And I posted the FM news  \n12:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So, all done?  \n12:34\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I just did the French wikipedia.  \n12:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I wonder if the maven site will build.

Tomcat?  \n16:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or the default Jetty bundled in the zip?  \n16:35\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0Jetty ?  \n16:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, then the logs should be printed on the command line  \n16:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Did a cmd window open when you started the server?  \n16:35\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0Yes, and are they stored in a file?  \n16:35\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0Yes the console is there  \n16:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No, just printed for the moment  \n16:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0(we just disabled the file logs in 3.0)  \n16:36\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0the buffer of the console window seems to be to small for all the log text  \n16:36\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0oh, ok  \n16:37\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0First i get Started [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):8080  \n16:37\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0But the errors start when i try to connect to it  \n16:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n16:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You should be able to increase the scroll buffer by editing the window properties  \n16:38\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0When are the tables created ? The first time i connect ?  \n16:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n16:41\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0I changed buffer to 999 but is not enough.  \n16:47\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0in the hibernate.cfg.xml we config \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<mapping resource=\"xwiki.oracle.hbm.xml\"/> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<mapping resource=\"feeds.oracle.hbm.xml\"/> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<mapping resource=\"activitystream.hbm.xml\"/> But these are not present in the folders...  \n16:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0They should be inside the xwiki-core-3.0,jar  \n17:09\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0sdumitriu: I could only find xwiki-enterprise-installer-generic-3.0-standard.jar. Can you provide the link, please?  \n17:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0webapps\\xwiki\\WEB-INF\\lib\\xwiki-core-3.0.jar  \n17:10\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0thank you  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Should I add xoffice and xeclipse as submodules to trunks?  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0They're not part of the usual workspace  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So I'd say no  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: personally I don't think we should have trunks  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's a simple way to checkout the usual repos  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it really depends on what people want to work on  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's bit of a pain to update the submodules  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to remember the command line...  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The problem is that it uses read-write submodules, so it's useless for contributors/users  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: It's simple, \"git sup\"  \n17:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0...Once you've set up the alias  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have an alias?  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still I don't really see the need  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the pros are small  \n17:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, it's not mandatory to use it  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway if we want to keep it then it should be called xwiki-enterprise-trunks I guess or xwiki-manager-trunks  \n17:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Unless you think it's doing more harm, I'd like to keep it  \n17:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or even developer-trunks or committer-trunks since it only works for developers  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure yet if it does more harm or not, it can certainly confuse users a bit. It's fine to keep them if you think they're useful  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think devs would really need/use them, it's more for contributors I'd say  \n17:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I do  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also it seems to require maintenance, I see regular updates from you about htem  \n17:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The problem is that the commands to use it are not that easy to know and remember at the moment  \n17:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, so I was thinking that we should only commit releases  \n17:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or have a hook that automatically updates when a commit on one of the submodule's master happens  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know enough about gitmodules to give an opinion on this :)  \n17:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'd rather keep it for tags only  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you were to spend some time on hooks I'd like the email diff one ;)  \n17:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Me too  \n17:17\u00a0<Chami>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:25\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0has quit  \n17:25\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n17:34\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:45\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0Strange: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01918: l'utilisateur 'XWIKI' n'existe pas  \n17:45\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0But i have configurated the hibernate.cfg.xml  \n17:45\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0and my user is xwikitest  \n17:46\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0Is there some other file i have to set up  \n17:46\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0?  \n17:49\u00a0<asyd>\u00a0can you paste your hibernate.cfg.xml ?  \n17:49\u00a0<asyd>\u00a0and btw, having french locales on a server is a bad thing :P  \n17:49\u00a0<Mondstrahl>\u00a0<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?> <!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC \"-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD//EN\" \u00a0\u00a0\"http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd\"> <hibernate-configuration> \u00a0\u00a0<session-factory> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<!-- Please refer to the installation guide on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation for configuring your \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0database.
