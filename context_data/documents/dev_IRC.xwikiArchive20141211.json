I found an old thread that says it's not possible. Does it still true ?  \n14:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yes, it is still true. Depending on what you're doing, the parent/child relationship of pages might solve your problem.  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0there's no real notion of spaces, there's only a parent/child relationship notion alex00000123  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0but that relationship can go as deep as you wish ;)  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0we would like to introduce the concept of space at some point (and also nested spaces)  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0right now we just have pages and if \"spaces\" are inferred from page names\u2026 (the XXX in XXX.YYY)  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0s/if//  \n14:54\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:06\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n15:20\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0Thank tou vmassol1 for your answer  \n15:21\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0you\u00b5  \n15:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0alex00000123: don`t forget about the subwiki alternative. Depending on your content structuring/workflow needs, sometimes using a subwiki is also useful.  \n15:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Folks, don`t be shy, remember it`s BugFixingDay#74 today. http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/XWikiDays#HBugfixingdays  \n15:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we need to get through the remaining ~50 bugs so that we can take care of other stuff as well.  \n15:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0...since we all have other stuff to do :)  \n15:25\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0Did you know that the \"edit\" button is still displayed on the editing form ? If we click on it, tha page is flushed !  \n15:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0alex00000123: you mean that the edit(wiki/wysiwyg/inine) button is displayed on the top right of a document content when the document is being edited?  \n15:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if so, than that is considered normal behavior  \n15:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we could see it as an improvement to hide that edit button, only for 'simple' users, since it opens up possible problems by users clicking it  \n15:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for 'advanced' users, however, that button will stay there because it has multiple editing options (wiki/wysiwyg/inine), so an advanced user might want to change editor.  \n15:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0alex00000123: if that is what you are mentioning, please create a new Improvement jira issue on http://jira.xwiki.org detailing it and we`ll look into it at some point ;)  \n15:35\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0Yes, I mean the button on the top right when a document is being edited \u00a0;)  \n15:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0alex00000123: actually I`ve reopened this older issue http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10464 and updated it to focus on this particular problem of the edit button.  \n15:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0please feel free to comment on it / monitor it / offer to fix it / etc :)  \n15:45\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0Thank you !  \n15:49\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0I disturb U a little more, because I've trouble to move a page by renaming it. I would like a page to be the child of another page  \n15:50\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0According to the documentation, we can move pages by renaming them  \n16:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0there are 2 relationships: one is wiki>space>page and the other is parent>children  \n16:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0one appears in the top menu - the other in the breadcrumb  \n16:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0to change the first relationship - you need to move the page  \n16:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0to change the parent > child - you just need to change the parent  \n16:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0alex00000123: so just go in edit mode on a page and see the little button in the top right, on the far right side of the breadcrums section, just above the Edit button's location. Press it and an input will appear above the document title to specify a parent document.  \n16:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that's for the parent-child relationship  \n16:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this is for Renaming: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/DocumentLifecycle#HMove2FRename  \n16:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Google is your friend.  \n16:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Parent editing: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/PageEditing#HSettingthepageparent  \n16:33\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:42\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0Thank you, actually I've seen those pages through Google, but I didn't see the \"change location\" button \u00a0:D  \n16:42\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0Now everything is ok  \n16:50\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0bye \u00a0:)  \n16:50\u00a0<alex00000123>\u00a0has quit  \n16:54\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:15\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:35\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n19:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:56\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:04\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:18\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:05\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:20\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:36\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n22:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n22:22\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
