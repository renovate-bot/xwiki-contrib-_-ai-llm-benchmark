If you could have a quick look at http://markmail.org/message/relaoly3au6qh33w and let me know what you think, that would help me fix XWIKI-13695 Thanks!  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just replied with another idea  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: Could you tell me where XarScriptService is used? I couldn't find that  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah wait I forgot to check somewhere  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found it  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: does it make sense to you that I add my api to XarScriptService and split xwiki-platform-xar into xwiki-platform-xar-model \u00a0+ xwiki-platform-xar-script \u00a0(and add a dep on oldcore in xwiki-platform-xar-script)?  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should be OK for now I guess even if it's going to add a very different abstraction level to the current script service which is only about XAR format right now  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but script service is not really the kind of thing you use outside of XWiki  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:53\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: fyi the 'recommended\" badge doesn't look so good with the \"imported\u2026\" message.
