In a folder where xWiki instance is running or 2.) Somewhere on some SMTP servers ?  \n18:05\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a02  \n18:06\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0If you use javax.mail, then you must use it together with a real SMTP server  \n18:07\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0If you use Apache James, then you don't use javax.mail at all, and James has its own APIs for receiving emails  \n18:08\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0sdumitriu : so we need to integrate Apache James with xWiki  \n18:09\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep  \n18:09\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0James will receive emails and notify XWiki about those emails  \n18:09\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0XWiki then processes these emails and decides what to do with them  \n18:10\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0If they're identified as emails that should be attached to an existing document, then put the content in a comment  \n18:11\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0sdumitriu : so that means Apache James instance should start when an xWiki instance is started and should wait for emails ?  \n18:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0No  \n18:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's a library  \n18:13\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It lives inside XWiki and it start inside XWiki when XWiki starts  \n18:19\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0has quit  \n18:22\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:25\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0sdumitriu : SMTP part of Apache James will receive the mail and \u00a0will notify a component. Do we have to embed Apache James like given here http://wiki.apache.org/james/Embedded  \n18:25\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0although for jetty its not given  \n18:25\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0but i think some similar steps will do the trick  \n18:29\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Tomcat is almost the same as Jetty  \n18:33\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0sdumitriu : Is this the way in which Apache James startup will be integrated with xWiki ?  \n18:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't think so  \n18:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0That's the whole enterprise mail server  \n18:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0We just need the part that can receive emails  \n18:42\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0sdumitriu : yep , \u00a0the SMTP part and the api but we will have to start that part with the xWiki instance  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<AlexCH>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:47\u00a0<kaysush>\u00a0has quit  \n20:00\u00a0<AlexCH>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: you'll need to update http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/TestReports/ManualTestReportXWiki50RC1  \n20:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:55\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:33\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:33\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:11\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:13\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:14\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n23:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:56\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
