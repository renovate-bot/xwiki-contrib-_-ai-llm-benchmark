 \nvmassol - (09:34): (and hi btw ;))  \nsilviar - (09:34): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-5257  \nsilviar - (09:34): 2.4 M1  \nsilviar - (09:34): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-5256  \nvmassol - (09:34): so this is a regression in 2.4 and it works fine in 2.3.x?  \nsilviar - (09:34): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XAADMINISTRATION-145  \nsilviar - (09:34): yes  \nsilviar - (09:35): let me double check with Sorin and will get back about 2.3.x  \nvmassol - (09:35): ok so indeed it needs to be fixed for 2.4M2  \nvmassol - (09:35): who can have a look?  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 09:37  \nsilviar - (09:38): checked again on 2.3.1; things work  \nfmancinelli left at 09:40 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nsburjan - (09:41): yeah, it works on 2.3.1  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:48): vmassol: I have some questions about the reference model.  \nvmassol - (09:48): CalebJamesDeLisl: hi, sure\u2026.  \nvmassol - (09:48): (thomas is more an expert than me but with both of us we can probably answer)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:49): Why weren't the fields in EntityReference made final?  \nvmassol - (09:49): you want to make ER immutable?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:50): That would have prevented the bug from yesterday.  \nvmassol - (09:50): I think we want to be able to modify an ER  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 09:50  \nvmassol - (09:50): as thomas said what should be immutable is DR probably  \nvmassol - (09:50): DocumentReference  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:50): Why would you want to modify an entity reference?  \nvmassol - (09:50): but yes maybe ER could be too, haven't thought enough about it  \nmflorea left at 09:51 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:51): When a document is moved all references break anyway.  \nvmassol - (09:51): tmortagne: any reason why we wouldn't want ER to be immutable?  \nvmassol - (09:52): (it would mean a lot of object creation but that's probably ok)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:53): IMO each entity should have one and only one reference which leads to my next question: Why does ER have getChild when each entity actually has 0 or more children?  \ntmortagne - (09:54): i guess it was about object creation at first  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:55): re object creation: I'd be more worried about cache#getDocument returning a clone each time.  \ntmortagne - (09:55): problem is that change that now would be extremely difficult since it would be a huge api breakage  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 09:55  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:55): getChild would break api?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:56): How about deprecate getChild and replace with Set<EntityReference> getChildren() for now the set will only contain a single entry (what getChild would have had.)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:57): In future getChildren may behave like File#listFiles()  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 10:09  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 10:09  \ntmortagne - (10:11): CalebJamesDeLisl: i was talking to vmassol about immutable references  \nsburjan\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:11  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:11): Sound feasible?  \nsburjan left at 10:11 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:19  \nsburjan\\_ is now known as sburjan ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 10:24  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:32): I'd like to move invitation into platform and create a dependency in enterprise today as per my proposal on Monday.  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 10:32  \nvmassol - (10:33): CalebJamesDeLisl: I was travelling abroad all week so haven't had the chance of checking out your work on the invitation manager but sounds good  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 10:33  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:33): Ahh, where were you?  \nvmassol - (10:33): Algeria  \nvmassol - (10:34): (giving a xwiki training on core stuff)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:34): Neat.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:36): Re XPQL I looked at it and can't see anything but somebody should try the usual suspects ' \\ ; and some database specific stuff $$ for postgres {} for oracle.  \nvmassol - (10:36): yes  \nvmassol - (10:36): but I'm interested to know why we havcen't been using it  \nvmassol - (10:37): it's been there for a while  \nvmassol - (10:37): (> 1 year)  \nvmassol - (10:37): and XWQL looks vastly superior to our HQL  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:38): Every layer of abstraction brings more bugs and makes them harder to detect.  \nabusenius - (10:39): let's switch to assembler then ^^  \nvmassol - (10:39): sure but we want to go in that direction of more abstraction IMO ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:39): If we could go from XWQL strait to db specific SQL then I'd be +1 all the way. Hibernate is much more than we need.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:40): Java has the advantage over assembler that it adds security (you can construct arbitrary pointers and wreck havoc).  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:40): s/can/can't  \nvmassol - (10:41): same with hibernate which performs some security checks (just to play the devil's advocate)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:41): But that said Java is painfully slow and eats \\_all\\_ of your ram.  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 10:41  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:42): My beef with hibernate is that it has so many features which we don't use and don't understand well enough. Those are all potential security issues.  \nvmassol - (10:42): isn't it the same with java?  \nvmassol - (10:42): and still it's great  \nvmassol - (10:42): and I wouldn't go back to anything else  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:42): Java itself is relatively simple, it's all the libraries.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:43): But point taken.  \nabusenius - (10:44): short question, if I want to display some custom page to the user from a component, what is the best way to do so?  \nvmassol - (10:44): tmortagne: wdyt about moving the deprecated method in Transformation in an aspect to make sure it's not used elsewhere and to follow our rule re deprecations?  \nabusenius - (10:44): adding a template to web/\\*\\*/templates doesn't seem right  \nvmassol - (10:44): we need to review if that rule is still ok since I think you had doubts. The only problem I can see with it is that running aspect is slightly slower than javac but it's managable IMO  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:46): abusenius: What are you using it for?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:46): Is it worth makeing a wiki page?  \nabusenius - (10:46): I want to show a warning when a secret token check fails  \ntmortagne - (10:46): vmassol: aspect does not really make it hidden for user of the api, it will still appear since it's injected in the class when rendering-api is built  \nabusenius - (10:46): and allow user to confirm  \nvmassol - (10:47): tmortagne: yes I know  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:47): I would do a wiki page. Anyone else have any other thoughts?  \nvmassol - (10:47): but it'll make all deprecation separated and if your IDE is configured not to weave aspects you'll not see the deprecation apis  \nvmassol - (10:48): (the reason why we decided about thet aspect strategy a while back)  \nvmassol - (10:48): do you have a beef with that strategy?  \nabusenius - (10:48): CalebJamesDeLisl, a wiki page in a separate application?  \nvmassol - (10:48): tmortagne: ie with http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DevelopmentPractices#HBackwardCompatibility  \ntmortagne - (10:49): vmassol: it's just the building time which is a pain for me in core  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:49): abusenius: Hmm. is there an existing application which it would fit in?  \nvmassol - (10:49): tmortagne: we could not execute them in the default profile  \nvmassol - (10:49): and have a profile to run them  \nvmassol - (10:49): or the other way around  \nvmassol - (10:50): -Pdev for ex could not run them for example  \nvmassol - (10:50): (hmm aybe some other profile actually)  \ntmortagne - (10:50): it's more about hudson and release actually  \nvmassol - (10:50): it would be a good test btw to ensure that XE doesn't use them when we run our functional tests  \nvmassol - (10:51): for safety we could have them on by default  \nvmassol - (10:51): and have a profile not to run them  \nvmassol - (10:51): so that we dont do a release without them  \nvmassol - (10:51): or we could use the release property  \nvmassol - (10:51): to ensure they're added for releases  \nabusenius - (10:51): CalebJamesDeLisl, well, im principle this page should be there by default, so maybe administration  \nvmassol - (10:52): I think I'll like the profile actviated on release solution the best  \ntmortagne - (10:52): vmassol: intregation test would not really work because of plugins  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:52): abusenius: IMO there should be an application for basic functions like edit, if you propse one you will have my +1  \nvmassol - (10:52): tmortagne: of course  \nvmassol - (10:52): we use aspects only when the deprecated code is not used anywhere inthe platform  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:52): Barring that I guess you're stuck using templates.  \nvmassol - (10:53): it's just there to ensure it won't come back  \nvmassol - (10:53): (ie nobody will add usage again in the platform)  \nvmassol - (10:53): I don't know if it's true for existing aspects  \ntmortagne - (10:53): i don't think so  \nabusenius - (10:53): CalebJamesDeLisl, good idea, and yes  \nvmassol - (10:54): tmortagne: easy to test  \ntmortagne - (10:54): existing aspect has been put in aspect when they became deprecated  \ntmortagne - (10:54): that' swas the only ruke for core  \ntmortagne - (10:54): s/ruke/rule/  \nabusenius - (10:54): are there any future plans to move all templates to applications or something like that?  \nvmassol - (10:54): when they became deprecated \\*and\\* their usage removed from platform (except plugins)  \nvmassol - (10:54): s/except plugins/except plugins maybe/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:55): abusenius: I suggested it here but I don't think there was a formal proposal. Again +1 for that.  \nmariusbutuc joined #xwiki at 10:55  \nvmassol - (10:55): tmortagne: I'll do a test  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:56): One trouble is that we will soon find a need for XAR's which depend on one another,  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:56): .  \ntmortagne - (10:56): it's been a long time since we did not added more thing in aspect i think even if we made more methods deprecated  \nvmassol - (10:56): tmortagne: but do you agree with the strategy if we can put it in place?  \nvmassol - (10:56): tmortagne: yes and that's why I'd like to reinitiate this  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:57): abusenius: Is your code in the sandbox? I'd be interested to take a look.  \nabusenius - (10:57): CalebJamesDeLisl, yea, isn't the new extension manager supposed to take care of that? :)  \nvmassol - (10:57): (tmortagne: with the profile building core will be even faster than now locally)  \ntmortagne - (10:57): vmassol: the strategy sound good it theory except that removing aspect at some point will be very difficult i think  \nabusenius - (10:57): CalebJamesDeLisl: no, I have a local git repo (I'll upload it to jira today anyway)  \nvmassol - (10:58): tmortagne: well our rule is 2 final releases currently  \nvmassol - (10:58): ie about 6 months  \nvmassol - (10:58): if we don't agree with this we should revisit this rule  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:58): abusenius: You can get svn commit to the sandbox just by asking.  \nvmassol - (10:58): we could make it something like 2 major releases if we wanted longer periods  \nvmassol - (10:58): that would mean 2 years  \ntmortagne - (10:58): if we did applyed this rule i can assure you that client upgrade would have been a real pain :)  \nvmassol - (10:59): we can have 2 deprecation rules  \nvmassol - (10:59): one for stuff access by wiki pages  \nvmassol - (10:59): (ie from velocity scripts)  \nvmassol - (10:59): and one for non velocity stuff  \nabusenius - (10:59): CalebJamesDeLisl, this would complicate my setup even further (I have many branches on top of the current trunk to be in sync)  \nvmassol - (10:59): ie api package vs the rest for ex  \nvmassol - (11:00): since the depreation severity is not the same for them  \nvmassol - (11:00): s/depreation/deprecation/  \nsdumitriu - (11:00): vmassol: What's the policy on changing a file's license? If the new code is changed a lot, can we onsider that it's new code which gets a new license? I'm talking about the apache licensed files in our core  \ntmortagne - (11:00): vmassol: that would mean modifying plugin a lot more often than now, most of them would not work anymore for example  \nvmassol - (11:01): sdumitriu: we can have 2 licenses in the file header  \nvmassol - (11:01): now I don't know when it boils down to a single line for ex  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:01): abusenius: Ping me with the jira issue when you gave the patch, I'll put it in a tab so I can lose it when I kill FF.  \nvmassol - (11:01): or down to a word to push to the extreme  \nvmassol - (11:01): ;)  \nabusenius - (11:01): CalebJamesDeLisl, ok  \nvmassol - (11:02): sdumitriu: I guess the rule is  \nvmassol - (11:02): that the author of the original code can recognize it's his code or not  \nvmassol - (11:02): or something like this  \nvmassol - (11:02): at least that would make sense to me  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:03): Hmm speaking of Wine I have more wining to do about references.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:04): My last question is why does XWikiDocument have fields which are initialized with Utils.getComponent?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:04): In a perfect world would XWikiDocument be a component with @Requirement annotations?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:07): -- Hmm it suddenly got quiet, have to remember that trick ;)  \nSvenDowideit left at 11:09 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 11:09  \nvmassol - (11:12): CalebJamesDeLisl: xwiki-core is old stuff  \nvmassol - (11:12): whenever we redesign something we write it using components  \nvmassol - (11:12): and move it in its domain module  \nvmassol - (11:13): you're talking about the new model here  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:13): Should a Document object be a component?  \nvmassol - (11:13): I think so since it will use services such as storage, etc  \nvmassol - (11:13): see the discussion about the new model  \nvmassol - (11:13): ie anemic model vs rich model  \nvmassol - (11:14): (anemic means only DAOs)  \nvmassol - (11:15): we discussed it on the list some time ago  \nvmassol - (11:15): (maybe 1 year ago)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:15): My thinking is that a document (whatever form it takes) should be a unit without dependencies.  \nvmassol - (11:15): yes that's an anemic model  \nvmassol - (11:16): you can google that  \nvmassol - (11:16): you should find references to it I think  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:16): I did google it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:16): I'm fine for services to depend on serviced but Documents are not services.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:17): I ran into this when I tried to do serialization of XWikiDocuments and found I had to hook the test framework.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:17): Which means Documents couldn't be built/manipulated outside of XWiki.  \nabusenius - (11:20): is there a deep reason for all applications having a different version (and in particular a version different from the core)?  \nabusenius - (11:20): I find it confusing  \nvmassol - (11:20): abusenius: each app can be released independently  \nabusenius - (11:21): can be, but are they?  \nvmassol - (11:21): and all apps are not released with the core  \nvmassol - (11:21): since it would mean they have to be ready before we can release teh core  \nabusenius - (11:21): ok, I see  \nvmassol - (11:21): which doesn't scale  \nvmassol - (11:22): in practice  \nvmassol - (11:22): we release several apps with the core  \nvmassol - (11:22): (but not all)  \nabusenius - (11:22): I would version those = to the core  \nvmassol - (11:22): but each release of the core  \nvmassol - (11:22): deosn't re-release apps  \nvmassol - (11:22): that ahven't changed for ex  \nvmassol - (11:23): abusenius: we're working in the complete other direction :)  \nvmassol - (11:23): with the extension manager  \nvmassol - (11:23): you have a running core and you install apps  \nvmassol - (11:23): you don't need to reinstall a new core to get new apps  \nvmassol - (11:24): you install and upgrade apps as they become avail  \nvmassol - (11:24): this will be more and more true in the future  \nvmassol - (11:24): (it's already true to a large extent)  \nabusenius - (11:24): ok, I see the point, but this also means the user has to know what version is currently the best for all apps  \nvmassol - (11:25): yes right now this is manual  \nvmassol - (11:25): normally  \nvmassol - (11:25): each app's doc page on xwiki.org  \nvmassol - (11:25): should have a compatibility matrix  \nabusenius - (11:25): I like the approach e.g. KDE uses, \\*all\\* their apps have the same version, no matter if they were changed or not  \nvmassol - (11:25): btw this could be some work for silviar and sburjan  \nvmassol - (11:25): to set this up  \nvmassol - (11:25): with the extension manager it'll become automated  \nabusenius - (11:26): true, extension manager will take care of those things  \nsdumitriu - (11:32): What do you think of the sticky content menu? Take a look at the incubator and scroll down the page  \nsdumitriu - (11:32): Could it be included by default?  \nsdumitriu - (11:32): Does anyone disagree with the behavior?  \nvmassol - (11:33): looks good to me  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:34): I remove things like that with greasemonkey.  \nabusenius - (11:34): cool, I like it  \nabusenius - (11:35): (as long as it stays thin, JIRA overdoes it a bit)  \nsdumitriu - (11:35): Well, it grows when you also show the annotations settings  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:35): At least firefox fixed the horrible linux fixed bug.  \nsdumitriu - (11:36): CalebJamesDeLisl: Don't you think it's useful to have the menu available in the middle of the page?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:36): Might be useful but my browser is my browser.

I'll look while tests are running.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:15): Looks good, how are you planning on representing the tokens?  \nabusenius - (12:16): wdym representing?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:18): Sending them to the browser and getting them back.  \nabusenius - (12:20): well, they need to be included into generated html manually using $services.csrf.getToken()  \nabusenius - (12:20): and actions would check if the form\\_token parameter is valid  \nabusenius - (12:21): sometimes the logic is in velocity, so there you can also use isTokenValid()  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:22): I did some experimentation and found that if you send them with a $response.sendRedirect and get them back as a parameter in the referer header, it's ridiculously hard to exploit XSS flaws.  \nabusenius - (12:22): I have a big patch fixing all templates and applications that seems to work, I'll attach it to the bug later today  \nabusenius - (12:23): you mean on e.g. save automatically redirect to the same url + token?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:23): My finding was that if you sendRedirect and append it as a parameter, XmlHttpRequest can't see the redirect.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:24): Then you get it back through the referrer and javascript can't forge a referrer, only old versions of flash.  \nabusenius - (12:25): yea, but there is no refferer with https  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:25): It's very close to air tight.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:26): There isn't?  \nabusenius - (12:26): no, it is not included into the request for some reason  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:27): That's odd.  \nabusenius - (12:27): I still don't completely get your idea, so the form that posts some data doesnt have the token, and then in java we redirect to some url with token?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:28): s/some/same  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:28): back to same url and the token is passed as a url parameter.  \nabusenius - (12:28): ok, but how does it help to defend csrf if you can just use the url and it is redirected for you :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:29): No the edit page redirects back to the edit page.  \nabusenius - (12:29): and then?  \nabusenius - (12:29): user has to click again?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:30): Then there is a parameter so when you save it will know you were actually on the edit page before saving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:30): User clicks edit -> edit page says \"no token, redirect\" -> edit page loads and says \"has token, no redirect\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:31): then user clicks save, save action looks at referrer and validates parameter.  \nabusenius - (12:31): ah, ok  \nabusenius - (12:31): ok, so still the problem is that it wont work with https  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:32): In firefox, a parameter which is passed once will pass to the next post.  \nabusenius - (12:32): we can forward parameters in edit page manually if needed  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:33): I think it's a confiuration issue since google shows nothing about ssl and no referrer.  \nabusenius - (12:33): but if we cant check referer, there is no reason to redirect, we just include the token  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:34): The point of the redirect is that XmlHttpRequest can't see the final url after a redirect.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:34): It's not perfect but it makes XSS a huge pain to attack.  \nabusenius - (12:35): hm, referer indeed may work between two https pages  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:35): For XSS they would then have to use popups or iframes and both can be jail broken.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:36): I love that trick because it means we don't have to trust that there will never be XSS.  \nsdumitriu - (12:36): bblfish: I presented WebID recently, I hope i got the facts right: http://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0Aa8Rb0\\_N5U84ZGNqcndmaDVfNWhwNW1icWc0&hl=en  \nbblfish - (12:37): cool  \nabusenius - (12:37): CalebJamesDeLisl, yea, sound very nice, I need to experiment a bit with it too  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:38): In my attacking I was able to segfault firefox but I couldn't defeat that technique ;)  \nabusenius - (12:38): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:38): javascript forkbomb -> firefox SIGSEGV  \nbblfish - (12:39): sdumitriu: yes, nearly the Web ID is linked to the profile page but is not it. It is a URL for you.(ie usually the Profile url + #something )  \nabusenius - (12:39): I guess this trick is easy to add, its just 3 lines in the beginning of each template  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:40): Yup, and http redirects are not that expensive.  \nbblfish - (12:40): I need to improve the page at http://esw.w3.org/WebID to explain that more clearly  \nabusenius - (12:40): anyway, the hardest part is to patch everything to use tokens  \nbblfish - (12:40): but thanks for that presentation  \nbblfish - (12:40): great, will tweet  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:41): Start with save action, and edit page I suppose.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:42): AFAIK AdminAction is not used anymore.  \nbblfish - (12:42): sdumitriu: tweeted!  \nabusenius - (12:43): I already patched them all actually (I hope), I need somebody to apply it and test in real-world installation  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:43): Also probably want to make it configurable because it's going to break user implementations.  \nabusenius - (12:43): it is  \nabusenius - (12:43): (both)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:43): Meaning you can turn it off?  \nabusenius - (12:43): yes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:43): +1 New installations have it on, old ones may need to turn it off.  \nabusenius - (12:44): we can let it off for testing period, and then change the default  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:46): If we were to add a little piece of javascript to the top of the edit page to detect and jailbreak iframes and popups, I think this would be bulletproof.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:48): Another way to aggrevate XSS attempts is: \u00a0\u00a0XmlHttpRequest = null; at the end of the head.  \nabusenius - (12:48): there are ways to not include header  \nabusenius - (12:49): xpage=template  \nabusenius - (12:49): just renders the template  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:49): Not include htmlHeader.vm?  \nbblfish left at 12:49 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nabusenius - (12:50): I think it just renders the template  \nabusenius - (12:50): its somewhere in XWikiAction.action()  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:50): Yes xpage=template.vm renders \\_only\\_ template.vm  \nabusenius - (12:51): so, we don't have a single place to control the header and footer  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:52): Nope. The only way is modify view.vm or edit.vm or whatever action you are looking to change.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:52): I think view.vm calls startpage.vm which calls htmlheader.vm \u00a0something like that.  \nabusenius - (12:53): yea, IMO it is better to move away from this xpage hack, but this will not happen any time soon  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:55): Extension manager will take care of it ;)  \nsburjan - (13:48): can anyone tell me why my attachments get a new version when I roll back to an eralier version ?  \nsburjan - (13:50): I mean not only my attachments ..

I don;t know if this is normal behaviour because I'm not so familiar with CORE  \ntmortagne - (17:56): sburjan: sdumitriu explained earlier already why there is this behavior and why it's impossible to fix it right now  \nsburjan - (17:56): can't find in the logs  \nsburjan - (17:56): could you tell me the hour ?  \nsburjan - (17:57): i mean the time when he said that  \ntmortagne - (17:57): (01:56:47 PM) sdumitriu: If I rollback to the December 2009 version of the document, I should also see the attachments as they were on December 2009  \ntmortagne - (17:57): (01:57:03 PM) sdumitriu: And creating a new version is the only way to do it right now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:58): Which profiles in applications pom to add invitation to? all?  \nevalica1 left at 17:58 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsburjan - (17:58): thanks, didn't had these lines in my logs.. internet problems :P  \nsburjan - (17:58): okay guys.. have a nice evening and a pleasant weekend  \ntmortagne - (17:58): sburjan: actually i did not seen it first but there is \"(02:00:04 PM) sburjan left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 260 seconds).\" just need theses lines  \nsburjan - (17:59): \\yeah ..Sorin out :)  \ntmortagne - (17:59): sburjan: you too  \ntmortagne - (17:59): s/need/neer/  \ntmortagne - (17:59): near  \ntmortagne - (17:59): anyway you understood ;)  \nsburjan left at 18:00 (Quit: Ex-Chat  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:01): Adding invitation to all profiles in applications/pom.xml since that seems to be standard for stuff bundled with xe.  \ntmortagne - (18:07): CalebJamesDeLisl: yep  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:08): Were the profiles something from the past? they seem to be mostly not used.  \ntmortagne - (18:09): CalebJamesDeLisl: yep pretty much since we are not supposed to have all theses products now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:10): I see.  \ntmortagne - (18:10): well not really actually  \ntmortagne - (18:10): theses are supposed to be here to build just the apps you need for XE for example  \ntmortagne - (18:11): instead of building everything  \ntmortagne - (18:11): i know i never us them but they are still meaningfull  \ntmortagne - (18:11): s/i never us them/i never them/  \njvdrean left at 18:12 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:13): One last question: I would like to add a web standards test for javascript attributes (onload, onunload etc.) Any objections?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:13): There is some testing but it's not complete.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:13): Should I make a proposal on the list?  \nvmassol - (18:14): a proposal is better  \nvmassol - (18:14): since otherwise developers will not know  \nvmassol - (18:14): how to code properly  \nvmassol - (18:14): along the lines of what you want to propose  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:14): Ok. I have heard that on\\*= is bad code style (and I agree) but it is not enforced.  \narkub left at 18:15 (Quit: Leaving  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:15): I \"could be argued\" that it's part of the WCAG standards.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:15): \\*It  \nvmassol - (18:15): CalebJamesDeLisl: the thing to pay attention to  \nvmassol - (18:15): is to not break the build  \nvmassol - (18:15): if you add a test and it breaks at 150 places  \nvmassol - (18:15): it's not good  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:16): There will be violations.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:16): 150 is not an outlandish estimate.  \nvmassol - (18:16): they need to be fixed before  \ntmortagne - (18:16): i tough this was already tested  \nvmassol - (18:16): before the check is applied  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:16): What about test driven development ;) ?  \nvmassol - (18:17): this is not TDD  \nvmassol - (18:17): not at all  \nvmassol - (18:17): TDD is:  \nvmassol - (18:17): - you code the test  \nvmassol - (18:17): - you code the code that make it pass  \nvmassol - (18:17): - you commit  \nvmassol - (18:17): this is exactly what I'm suggesting  \nvmassol - (18:17): :)  \nvmassol - (18:17): ie don't commit before the build passes  \nvmassol - (18:17): otherwise you're breaking everyone  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:17): Ok. Then it's not a good idea since it will never be finished.  \nvmassol - (18:17): as it's the case now in functional tests  \nvmassol - (18:18): CalebJamesDeLisl: yes that's why you'll need to be creative  \nvmassol - (18:18): :)  \nvmassol - (18:18): for ex:  \nvmassol - (18:18): ex :  \nvmassol - (18:18): have some include/exclude param  \nvmassol - (18:18): as we do for checkstyle  \nvmassol - (18:18): this is a good strategy when the domain to fix is too large to fix all at once  \nvmassol - (18:18): basically  \nvmassol - (18:18): the rule is  \nvmassol - (18:18): never ever break teh build  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:19): We have a lot of failures for WCAG and some for XHTML.  \nvmassol - (18:19): exactly!  \nvmassol - (18:19): and it's a major pita  \nvmassol - (18:19): it's hiding real failures  \nvmassol - (18:19): s/real/\"real\"/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:19): So if things are bad we should not test so we don't know about it?  \nvmassol - (18:19): and we can't release  \nvmassol - (18:20): WCAG is not a must have  \nvmassol - (18:20): the proof is that we've released 2.4M1 without them fixed  \nvmassol - (18:20): WCAG doesn't mean anything btw  \nvmassol - (18:20): it's almost impossible to achieve  \nvmassol - (18:20): it's only a given level of WCAG compliance that we can achieve  \nvmassol - (18:20): anyway  \nvmassol - (18:20): the point is  \nvmassol - (18:21): we need to control our build and set realistic expectations  \nvmassol - (18:21): for our releaes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:21): I think removing all onload= is not a \"must have\" either but we should get better over time.  \nvmassol - (18:21): saying things like:  \nvmassol - (18:21): we should fix all WCAG and all bad practices or we won't release  \nvmassol - (18:21): is just plain day-dreaming  \nvmassol - (18:21): exactyl  \nvmassol - (18:21): getting better over time is our goal  \nvmassol - (18:22): at the same time we need to perform releases  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:22): But how are we to improve over time if we won't add tests unless they will pass?  \nvmassol - (18:22): so if we have lots of tests failing, there's a big risk we won't see failures  \nvmassol - (18:22): for things we want to check for (ie past tests)  \nvmassol - (18:22): + hudson sending mails every minute  \nvmassol - (18:22): is not a good option for improving our trust in hudson  \nvmassol - (18:23): so if you want tests one good solution is:  \nvmassol - (18:23): - separate non passing tests that are normal from other tests  \nvmassol - (18:23): - don't have hudson send mails every time a normal non passing tests fail  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:23): Hmm, I forget that other devs don't filter the hudson mail into folders by type of test.  \nvmassol - (18:24): it's not even by type  \nvmassol - (18:24): in the WCAG tests suite  \nvmassol - (18:24): we have both kind  \nvmassol - (18:24): - tests that we have validated to be passing and if they're not it's a regression  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:24): +1  \nvmassol - (18:24): - tests that have been added and for which we haven't yet fixed the code for  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:25): We should worry about regressions not failing tests.  \nvmassol - (18:25): yes that's hte point  \nvmassol - (18:25): failing tests is an ongoing progress  \nvmassol - (18:25): but regression are must fix  \nvmassol - (18:25): before releases  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:26): I am new to development so I have learned most of what I know in this environment where tests fail and tell us what we have to do.  \nvmassol - (18:26): they do tell us  \nvmassol - (18:26): but this has to be combined with the need to release  \nvmassol - (18:26): and not to have regressions  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:27): You were talking about tests taking too long and I got the idea (wouldn't it be cool) to have a screensaver which ran selenium tests. </diversion>  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 18:27  \nvmassol - (18:27): a la SETI @ home ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:27): Yup.  \nvmassol - (18:27): actually  \nvmassol - (18:27): we even set this up at some point  \nbblfish1 joined #xwiki at 18:28  \nvmassol - (18:28): when we were using jetbrains's TeamCity  \nvmassol - (18:28): there's an agent to run it on your machine when it's idel  \nvmassol - (18:28): idle  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:28): I think if we are to change to a different CI software it should be XWiki ;)  \nvmassol - (18:28): we could register more agents to our hudson instance in the same manner  \nvmassol - (18:29): no no  \nvmassol - (18:29): we should keep hudson  \nvmassol - (18:29): it's the best out there  \nvmassol - (18:29): and it can be done easily with it with no dev  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:29): Hudson mail needs to be made more sane  \nvmassol - (18:29): everything is configurable in hudson  \nvmassol - (18:30): someone need to spend the time  \nnuvolari - (18:30): do you guys use virtualization in any way for CI?
