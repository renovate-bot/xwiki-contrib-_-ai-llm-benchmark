 \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- 6.2 now and 6.2.1, 6.2.2 (which was my plan)  \n19:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0sign that could be more?  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or as you say  \n19:00\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- 6.2RC2, RC3, 6.2  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the advantage with 6.2 is that we'll get more people trying it and reporting issues  \n19:00\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the downside is that we may disappoint people if it really doesn't work well  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think if we're prepared to release quickly a 6.2.1 in case of a big problem it could be ok  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also 6.1 is quite a bad release  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so having a 6.2 ASAP is not a bad sign since it's supposed to be better than 6.1 (I hope!)  \n19:01\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:02\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go to take a train\u2026 bbl  \n19:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I say we should release 6.2 now \u2026 and fix any other issues in 6.2.x  \n19:03\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0+1 for 6.2  \n19:09\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:06\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:35\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:37\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:08\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:27\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:27\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:46\u00a0<Chuguniy|2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:48\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n23:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-wysiwyg/59/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-wysiwyg/testReport/org.xwiki.test.wysiwyg/MacroTest/testDoubleClickToEditMacro/ is failing because of http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11057  \n23:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: looks like a blocker to me  \n23:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a05.4.3? so it's also buggy in 5.4.5?  \n23:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I tried it on xwiki.org  \n23:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and reproduced it  \n23:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it's not that much of a big deal, to be honest  \n23:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the fact that it's only inline macro makes it slightly less critical I guess  \n23:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and it's there for a long time apparently  \n23:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0plus if the user insists, the workaround can be used  \n23:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0i.e. double clicking on the macro's borders  \n23:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that`s why I did not mark it as blocker  \n23:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still think it's critical but indeed may be not blocker, it needs to be fixed for 6.2.1 though  \n23:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so  \n23:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it mean we've been releasing with failing tests since 5.4.3?  \n23:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since we have a test for it!)  \n23:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would be pretty bad....  \n23:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ve also tested on xwiki.org with the colibri skin, to see if the new flamingo skin did not somehow indirectly introduce it  \n23:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but it was still reproducible  \n23:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0on a separate note, I`ve taken agent3-3 offline because, for some reason, a great percentage of the tests running on it had xwiki startup issues  \n23:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0even if the agent seems rather clean  \n23:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've always been uneasy about releasing with failing tests for fear of something like this  \n23:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n23:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0will try again to debug this tomorrow  \n23:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0sure  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gtg  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have fun :)  \n23:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:52\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit\n"}
