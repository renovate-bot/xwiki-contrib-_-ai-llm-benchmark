IMO we shouldn't allow this, especially on LiveTables. WDYT ?  \n11:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0why? I worked a lot to make the annotations work on annotating everything  \n11:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, there are still limitations (html macro) but that's the direction  \n11:36\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0that's not the argument to allow it, of course, but I am curious why we shouldn't  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: htmlcleaner is published in the central repo now apparenrtly: http://htmlcleaner.sourceforge.net/  \n11:36\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0LiveTable content is generated dynamically. when you annotate a LiveTable result, what do you annotate more exactly ?  \n11:36\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0you annotate what you see  \n11:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0that's the whole idea  \n11:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0as long as you can see it, you can annotate it  \n11:37\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0when you won't see it anymore, you won't see the annotation anymore on the content, but you can still see it in the list of annotations on the page  \n11:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0on what page if the content is dynamically created by the LiveTable ?  \n11:38\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean really, the whole idea in the beginning was to be able to annotate content generated dinamically  \n11:38\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0on the page in which you see it :)  \n11:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, you know better  \n11:38\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I don't, I want to know how it's perceived  \n11:39\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean, if we don't allow annotations on dinamically generated content, would we allow it on a velocity macro, for example?  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes that's what is in my patch on http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XRENDERING-46 but i could not finish it  \n11:39\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0on content generated by a velocity macro  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok  \n11:40\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0doesn't make much sense to me to annotat econtent of LiveTables. And annotations on AS don't work. Same issue we have on blog. You annotate, but the annotation small yellow button is at the bottom  \n11:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I guess I should make an issue for that (lie we have for Blog)  \n11:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*like  \n11:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0also I am allowed to Annotate Search results, but I can't see the annotation because I don't have the annotations tab  \n11:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0nor any other tab on that page  \n11:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0devs, WDYT ?  \n11:48\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I do'nt see the problem  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a nice feature to me  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(being allowed to annotate everyhing)  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that it doesn't work on some stuff is a bug yes  \n11:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: yes, but they don't work. If I annotate WebHome on a LiveTable in which I have other 7 WebHome pages, annotation will be visible in the Annotations Tab, but \\_not\\_ on content  \n11:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sburjan: that must be the greatest coolest html macro ;)  \n11:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0whcih annotations don't handle, YET  \n11:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(I need to get some internet at home...)  \n11:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0anso, Annotations on search Page results is useless... I don't have even the tabs there :)  \n11:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I am +1 for Annotations in AS, but they don't work .. I'll report the bug on XE/AS App  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes annos on dynamic content is weird  \n11:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the pb is not that webhome appears several times, that should be handled. Worst case the first occurrence of the webhome will be displayed  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: do we have an exsiting easy way to disable annotations on a given page?  \n11:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0not on page, but on space  \n11:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0lucaa: yes, but my problem is that after annotating a WebHome result, I don't know which is the annoteted one.. for example after a refresh, etc  \n11:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I see it in the tab, but no yellow icon next to the annotated text  \n11:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I understand it's a great future, not trying to block it or something. it's just that there are places where it's unusable (Search Results page), and places where it would be useful but doesn't work (Blog, AS)  \n11:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0IMO a mechanism to blog annos at a page level would allow more flexibility (just a suggestion)  \n11:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*block  \n11:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and yes, harder to implement  \n12:02\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0no, it's not  \n12:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0IMO the best and safest strategy is to block something where it has no point instead of letting users users add it. Generates mess, which is harder to remove (impossible from UI)  \n12:02\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it's not harder to implement  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0what's impossible to remove?  \n12:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0lucaa: you know better :) I would be cool when editing a page to have a checkbox (wiki and WYSIWYG) ... \"Allow annotations on this page\"  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0you can remove all annotations, from the tab!  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0one by one, yes (unfo) but so are comments  \n12:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0If I annotate a result from Search Page, how can I remove it ? (I am a normal user, not a dev)  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0go to the annotations tab  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and there!  \n12:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I don't have tabs on that page  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0right  \n12:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I didn't know that  \n12:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I don't have any tab on that page  \n12:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I know, it's small, minor, but IMO it's inconsistent to be allowed to add annotation on that page  \n12:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so maybe maybe, in the same way we disable comments, attachments et all (by hiding the UI) we should disable annotations  \n12:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0on some pages we could \"hardcode\" this .. eg. Search Results. On normal pages, we could allow user to checkbox if it allows annotations. Because hiding the tab won't block ctrl+m action  \n12:06\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sburjan: no, we cannot hardcode anything ;)  \n12:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the way I see it, the problem is like this  \n12:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0just wanted to suggest to force a certain level of consistency on some pages that by their purpose don't need annotations  \n12:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0comments on search page don't make sense, in the same way in which annotations on search page don't make sense  \n12:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n12:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0also attachments :)  \n12:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0now, for the comments we hacked fix it: hide the UI and there, it's fixed  \n12:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but this is not a fix  \n12:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but I am still allowed to annotate, and I guess an object is save in the page  \n12:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*saved  \n12:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0since there is no way the annotations module could query this metadata of the page, so that I know that they should not be there  \n12:08\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I understand  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0this is metadata of the page (comments don't make sense), which is not stored anywhere  \n12:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so it's pretty impossible to achieve what I am saying  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it's just the UI is hidden  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0\"everything is possible, we just need to find out how\"  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I'm not saying it's not possible  \n12:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, but with annos is a bit complicated, hiding the tab won't block users from annotating  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0exactly  \n12:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I understand you POV :)  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so, what I'm saying, is that we need to fix the way this metadata is stored  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so that you can actually query it as metadata  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0or add a super velocity variable to disable annotations, or something, in the same way in which we have super velocity variables to hide tabs  \n12:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(and therefore \"disable\" those features)  \n12:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, we have multiple choices ..  \n12:26\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I think you missed my message from yesterday evening: should we add/keep links to Commons/Rendering javadoc on \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/API ? Or should we put \u00a0this information in their wikis? I'm more in favor of having the \u00a0javadoc links in one place.  \n12:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0btw, the link to the rendering javadoc is broken right now.

It's the first time we're doing this so I'm wondering  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it may be good I don't know\u2026. just look a bit techie to me  \n15:35\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I agree, note that I didn't use too many JIRA ids (at least comparing to http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise271 ). Also note that I put JIRA ids before TODOs just as a reference for the dev that should fill in the description. They should be removed afterwards  \n15:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I think we should keep them for the misc section because those are very specific issues  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: yes but fix is different MIO  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/but fix/bugfix releases/  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/MIO/IMO/  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll go over some of the misc things to beef them up too. I noticed one that I'd like to stand out more  \n15:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure. my idea was to add user friendly description for the big feaures/improvements introduced and list jira for the small ones. Again, the jira ids before TODOs are there only as a reference for the dev that need to write the description  \n15:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, cool  \n16:17\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:01\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0Maybe you are already aware of this but... Do you know about CoffeeScript (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script) ? Looks like a very interesting way for simplifying Javascript coding and protect coders from this language pitfalls  \n17:02\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0where's the DOM ?  \n17:02\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0:)  \n17:02\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0I think it's meant to be used for server side scripting  \n17:02\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0node.js in particular  \n17:04\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0jvelociter: AFAIU no. It supports everything works with Javascript, even clientside (e.g., JQuery & Co.)  \n17:05\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yes, but I don't think it's been build with client side in mind  \n17:06\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0jvelociter: why not?  \n17:07\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0also in my opinion it complexifies the dev cycle  \n17:08\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0since you have to run the transformer each time you change the slightest line  \n17:08\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0true  \n17:08\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0fmancinelli: there is no example of DOM manipulation in their examples  \n17:09\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0jvelociter: don't see where the problem is... afterall the DOM is exposed as JS object. Btw there are JQuery specific examples  \n17:10\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yep found  \n17:10\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0ok, but still I don't find this approach very agile for doing web development  \n17:11\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0the only advantage I see it brings is safer operators  \n17:11\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0IMO does not worth the cost of precompling  \n17:12\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0jvelociter: the language looks very nice compared to JS... I would rather learn CoffeScript than JavaScript :)  \n17:13\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0sure but that does not make it more adapted for what we are doing, that's all I'm saying:)  \n17:17\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0(same reason I find that GWT was not adapted to do XWiki Watch)  \n17:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, VisualBasic is simple as well, but that's not relevant  \n17:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The problem with using a meta-code framework is that you depend on the framework  \n17:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If CoffeeScript disappears, we'll be stuck with a bunch of code that doesn't evolve anymore  \n17:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0JS is simple  \n17:21\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0sdumitriu: well you could then generate your JS once and for all and work on the generated codebase ... ^^  \n17:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yeah, you try editing GWT-generated code...  \n17:39\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0not sure that the disappearing of coffeescript would be such a big problem for the ones who adopt it... anyway I was not pushing for anything.
