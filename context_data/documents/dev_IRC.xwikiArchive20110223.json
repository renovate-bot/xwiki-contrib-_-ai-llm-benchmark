Still trying to wrap my head around it.  \n10:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh, yeah, i never got around trying to digg through that  \n10:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0despite having messed with eMule quite a bit... \\*cough\\*  \n10:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i just never saw the point of trying to when the official devs request no changes there anyway. besides, they got the experience anyway ;)  \n10:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0official emule devs, that is  \n10:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0meh file sharing... otoh the software is quite awesome.  \n10:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it is...  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0my dns engine is talking with bittorrent nodes right now. and ofc I'm logging every packet.  \n10:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what do you log them for? gonna harrass them with the information you gained? ;)  \n10:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0although i am not a huge BT fan... i hate how most torrents die in a matter of just a few weeks  \n10:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0naw, just look at the packets, see if I'm missing anything in my implementation, look for non-standard messages.  \n10:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i see  \n10:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Oh and look for abuse/scraping/DoS/etc.  \n10:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0btw, why do you even write your own DNS engine?  \n10:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0proof of concept?  \n10:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Because mine doesn't rely on asking verisign who owns a domain.  \n10:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm, i imagine that this check is meant to keep urls from being spoofed, isn't it?  \n10:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Right now it can only look up dht nodes, next is look up public keys and validate signatures on the responses.  \n10:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mhmm  \n10:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0then make a big list that anyone can add to and that list maps user friendly domains to keys.  \n10:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0still, is there a real market for this?  \n10:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I assume not.  \n10:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's a hard problem.  \n10:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0especially since there are a few BT kind of DNS implementatoins surfacing after the whole wikileaks shit came down  \n10:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i figure so  \n10:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Hard problems get me up in the afternoon.  \n10:19\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0X-D  \n10:19\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/wp-content/uploads/Megamind-from-DreamWorks-Animation.jpg << your head is not quite that big, yet, though? right?  \n10:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe  \n10:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cjdns+is+named+cjd%2Bns+because+I+really+am+that+vane&btnG=Search  \n10:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0lol  \n10:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0isn't that the kind of dns i just meant?  \n10:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0dns-p2p? or .p2p?  \n10:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0.p2p i guess  \n10:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0well it was a disributed project without any leadership which is awesome but it doesn't get code written so I decided I would start on cjdns which was mine and would conform to my specifications and only mine.  \n10:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, i think that is one of the major problems with OpenSource software... priateers seldomly want leadership in a strong sense and without that nothing gets done as good as it could be  \n10:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0\\*privateers  \n10:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Well leadership is great and IMO needed but it needs to be by a leader and by a really good dev. I'd gladly work under a leader but without one I'll start my own project.  \n10:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0exactly  \n10:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Kind of like cjdns is a proposal, .p2p is a to be standard. I'm hoping it will become the reference implementation.  \n10:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, to be honest, i got my doubts about .p2p... the idea is great and i am all for liberalising the DNS market but unless the major platforms support this natively i don't think many will want to bother with .p2p unless they are full blown nerds  \n10:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0oh abusenius you'll get a kick out of this, proposed change to DHT was to store little pieces of info. They hash with sha256, good. They only lookup the first 160 bits, ok. They only validate the first 160 bits. facepalm.  \n10:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yea, if noone uses it then it'll be an interesting relic and I learn something from the adventure.  \n10:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Hello guys. shouldn't a page disappear \u00a0from Activity Stream after it has been deleted ?  \n10:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0OTOH opennic is reserving the .p2p tld for when the project is done so opennic nerds are in. Perhaps it will pick up steam, maybe not.  \n10:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sburjan: that way we couldn't see it was deleted...  \n10:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Instinct says no but I don't know of anything written on the topic.  \n10:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cjdelisle: this becoming a relique is likely because no commercial vendor will want to get into a war with the US government and that one company handing out domains and such  \n10:33\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0consistent view: if we show deleted comments, attachments why not show deleted pages?  \n10:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0^^  \n10:34\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0and is an activity stream ... so that's it's purpose to show activity  \n10:34\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0cjdelisle: well, 160 bit isn't that bad as long as long as sha256 is not too broken  \n10:35\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0and its definitely better than using sha1 instead  \n10:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Are you sure?  \n10:35\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0quite sure  \n10:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I would want to see some literature on trunkated sha2 before I stepped off of that path.  \n10:36\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0unless there is something really strange going on in sha256 algo that makes breaking first 160 bit easier than the whole thing  \n10:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The only thing I know is cryptographers make rules and you follow them.  \n10:37\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0in general, a good way (it's even proven afair) to make a short hash is to take a long one and cut it  \n10:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So there is literature on truncated sha2 collision resistance?  \n10:39\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0I have no idea, but I remember to read about truncating in Bruce Schneier's blog  \n10:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm. Anyway I suggested that if they truncate it then using p256 instead of p160 is overkill.  \n10:40\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0well, it's slower  \n10:40\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0but sha1 algo is more broken than sha256  \n10:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So anything which relies on sha1 could conceivably switch to truncated sha256 with minimal changes.  \n10:41\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0actually if I remember correctly sha512 is faster to compute on 64 bit cpus that shorter sha\\*  \n10:41\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0yea, basically  \n10:42\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0but in most cases it's probably not worth it  \n10:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0My proposal --> lookup the high bits of the key, get the value, validate. Their proposal --> lookup the truncated sha256 of the key + name, get value + key, validate with provided key.  \n10:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so how broken is sha-1? does it require huge resources to exploit the flaws or is it pretty easy to crack the thing?  \n10:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Never been actually broken AFAIK  \n10:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it's just getting weak.  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ahhh, good... you had me confused and slightly worried there ;)  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, that's to be expected at some point anyway  \n10:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Not like the md5 collisions R us, certificate authority  \n10:45\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0sha1 is broken in the sense that they are seriously searching for replacement  \n10:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay.  \n11:09\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n11:09\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:14\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:30\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I think it would be nice if we'd have panels in 2.0 syntax in 3.0 final  \n11:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: +1  \n11:57\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0restarting xwiki.org  \n15:49\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0started the bot  \n15:51\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cjdelisle: do you have any idea if there is a way to run a shell command and show the output in a xwiki page ?  \n16:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0something like each time the page is requested, the content is dynamically generated by running the shell command (more exactly, the command you gave me to get the test methods from all test classes)  \n16:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n16:50\u00a0<walters>\u00a0@cjdelisle: In Oracle you can use dbms\\_lob.substr(...) to get a part of the CLOB in the select query but I don't think this is a common sql statement. Maybe it's possible to put something oracle specific in the query?
