One more quick question... Those panels you helped me with.. When I was poking around there on the admin page, I saw no button to create new panels... Do I have to create new ones from the shell and not the webpage or something?  \nvmassol1 - (18:17): yes we need to address this, for now you have to go to the Panels.WebHome page  \nvmassol1 - (18:18): ctrl+G for ex  \nvmassol1 - (18:18): or in the URL directly  \nvmassol1 - (18:18): or the All Docs page  \nvmassol1 - (18:18): (all docs = index page)  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:19): Oh ok I see I see  \nvmassol1 - (18:19): tmortagne and others: what are we missing for the final 2.2 release?  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:19): Yeah that meta+g was ingeniously handy btw =)  \nvmassol1 - (18:19): any open issues?  \ntmortagne - (18:20): fixed http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-4898 but waiting for asiri to validate  \nvmassol1 - (18:20): is that the only blocker?  \ntmortagne - (18:20): all other issues can move i think  \ntmortagne - (18:20): in core  \ntmortagne - (18:20): looking at xe  \nvmassol1 - (18:21): do we need more testing?  \ntmortagne - (18:21): always :)  \nvmassol1 - (18:21): we haven't heard any pb on myxwiki.org I think but then we almost \u00a0never hear from users there  \ntmortagne - (18:21): yes  \ntmortagne - (18:22): don't see anything blocker in xe issues  \ntmortagne - (18:23): waiting for hudson to rebuild tests  \nmflorea left at 18:25 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne left at 18:36 (Quit: Leaving.  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:43): Would it be erroneous of me to guess that most of the demonstration scripting I am seeing in the default xwiki install is velocity?  \nvmassol1 - (18:43): no  \nvmassol1 - (18:43): it wouldn't be erroneous  \nvmassol1 - (18:44): it's 100% velocity  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:44): Cool cool  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:44): Velocity actually looks really simple too  \nvmassol1 - (18:44): it is  \nvmassol1 - (18:44): even guillaume lerouge picked it up\u2026 ah too bad he isn't here right now ;)  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:45): hehe..  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:45): Oh yeah? =) I've seen his name on a whole bunch of the wiki articles i've been goin through...  \nvmassol1 - (18:46): he's a marketing guy with no IT background...  \nvmassol1 - (18:46): but he's now picked up xwiki quite quickly  \nvmassol1 - (18:46): and he can now write wiki applications in wiki pages  \nvmassol1 - (18:46): he's written a few on http://code.xwiki.org  \nvmassol1 - (18:46): that's a cool testimonial that it's not too hard\u2026.  \nvmassol1 - (18:46): or that he's a genius  \nvmassol1 - (18:47): :)  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:47): Oh very cool. bodes well for me then!! =)  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:47): I am absolutely loving xwiki so far, but it's really making me want to learn that Velocity now :P  \nvmassol1 - (18:47): hehe  \nvmassol1 - (18:47): the power of xwiki is huge but indeed it needs a bit of knowledge to harvest the full power  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:48): Hey quick question vm.. My little panel I'm creating on my own here... It has that \"Jump to any page in the wiki (meta+g) reminder at the footer.. is there a way to supress that? Looking at the other examples I have I don't even know why it's there... \\*smirks\\*  \nvmassol1 - (18:48): hmm that should come from teh quick links panel content  \nsdumitriu - (18:48): It's generated by Javascript  \nsdumitriu - (18:48): Not in the panel  \nvmassol1 - (18:49): ah didn't know that  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:49): Yeah that's what I thought, but this isn't an edited quick links panel. It's created fresh from Panels.WebHome  \nvmassol1 - (18:49): that's strange  \nvmassol1 - (18:49): sdumitriu: do you know why?  \nvmassol1 - (18:49): why does it need js?  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:49): Maybe it has to do with the strange way I got rid of quick links.. I tried to revert to a previous version but it wasn't there - so i ended up deleting it entirely while it still added as a panel on the left frame.  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:50): \\*shrugs\\*  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:52): Yeah weird. It must have been. I removed it. Saved layout. Added it again, and it was gone. It had to have something to do with my screwy removal of Quick Links =)  \nvmassol1 - (18:52): Lord\\_Devi: sdumitriu should know better  \nsdumitriu - (18:53): vmassol1: It needs JS because without JS it will be misleading  \nsdumitriu - (18:54): Pressing Ctrl+G wouldn't do anything  \nsdumitriu - (18:54): So it would be a piece of text advertising missing functionality  \nvmassol1 - (18:55): sdumitriu: but the js is alwyas there  \nvmassol1 - (18:55): it's not optional  \nvmassol1 - (18:55): in any case it brings the issue at hand  \nvmassol1 - (18:55): which IMO is worse  \nsdumitriu - (18:55): The JS is optional  \nsdumitriu - (18:55): It always is  \nsdumitriu - (18:55): There's a little thing called NoScript  \nvmassol1 - (18:56): you mean if you disable it from the browser?  \nvmassol1 - (18:56): then why we don't we verify if js is active and only show the text if it is?  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:56): yay noscript...  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:57): hehe, curious question. vmass, sdum, which distro do you two prefer?  \nvmassol1 - (18:58): OSX 10.6.2  \nvmassol1 - (18:58): got to go  \nsdumitriu - (18:58): Gentoo  \nvmassol1 left at 18:58 (Quit: Leaving.  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:58): Thanks for the help Vmass!  \nLord\\_Devi - (18:58): Ah yeah ok.
