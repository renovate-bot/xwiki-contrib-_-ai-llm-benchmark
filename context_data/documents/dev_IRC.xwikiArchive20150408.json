 \n15:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: it's /usr/share/java/postgresql-jdbc4.jar, that's not the issue  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the change I made  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0/usr/share/java/postgresql-jdbc4.jar is supposed to work well with postgre  \n15:38\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0the issue is that postgresql-jdbc4.jar -> postgresql-jdbc4-9.1.jar and postgresql-jdbc4-9.1.jar doesn't work  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: on your system  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0on mide it's 9.2  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0probablem is there is not much more I can do at this package level  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/probablem/problem/  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/mide/mine/  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since I got report that it was working well with postgresql-jdbc4-9.2.jar I change the package to at least force using the jdbc4 one  \n15:39\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I guess postgresql-jdbc4-9.1.jar on Debian is \"https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-9.1-903.jdbc3.jar\", which is JDBC 3  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that would not make much sense that postgresql-jdbc4 point to a jdbc4 driver  \n15:40\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0hm... right  \n15:41\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I don't know then, do you want the error message and an other ticket when I try to start with postgresql-jdbc4-9.1.jar?  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure, also indicate your system exactly so that we know exactly where it does not work  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the workaround is to upgrade your driver some way  \n15:42\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0the workaround is not an issue, I've done it, it's just for other people :p  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe there is simply some bug in that driver version...  \n15:44\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0looking at the patch note https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html ...  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:51\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0r  \n15:51\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0(typo)  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: did you tried 7.0 with postgre recently ?  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would like to know which version of the driver you could make it work with if you did  \n16:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: hello. no, I haven't tested 7.0 on Postgres  \n16:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'll test now with the latest driver available  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: actually what I would like to know is the minimum version for the potgresql and mysql drivers  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the idea being to indicate this in the debian package  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think you tested several for mysql already  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: would be great to verify that XWiki doesn't work with the latest mysql drivers...  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as reported on the list  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a05.1.35 from memory  \n16:26\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: I already tested that and replied to that email. check it again :)  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Im lagging behind on my emails)  \n16:27\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0no problem  \n16:27\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0it's your birthday. I forgive you :D  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe thanks :)  \n16:28\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, I've tested some versions of the driver, but I didn't note down the version since they worked  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm lucky!  \n16:28\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0if the would fail, I would have reported an issue  \n16:29\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0they\\*  \n16:29\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: what driver versions do you want me to test ?  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for mysql no idea, I guess the first one claiming jdbc4 support  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for postgre it looks like there is an issue with the 9.1 one and it seems to work well with the 9.2-1002 one  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but there is several version between thos two  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see XE-1478  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what would be nice is confirm issue with 9.1 and test version after this one to find the first one that works with XWiki  \n16:33\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: as I can see here: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html there are 2 versions of 9.1: 1 that is jdbc3 compatible and one that is jdbc4 compatible. you want me to test the jdbc4 one, right ?  \n16:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: I'm only talking about jdbc4 drivers  \n16:34\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok. thanks  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that what is on \u00a0https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html are the supported version but they actually released more version than that  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure which one exactly Slashman has issue with  \n16:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: would to check the exact version of the 9.1 driver you have with apt-cache show for example  \n16:39\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:39\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0the version installed is 9.1-901-2  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok thanks  \n16:41\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0my guess is that this version works fine with postgres 9.1 which is in the wheezy repository  \n16:41\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I may hit a corner case because we use recent version of postgres  \n16:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from what I see the last 9.1 version is the 903, maybe some bug has been fixed in it  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or yes maybe 9.1 simply does not like too much postgre 9.3  \n16:43\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0well, postgres 9.1 was released in 2011  \n16:43\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0so that may be the problem  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea debian stable does not exactly contains most recent stuff :)  \n16:46\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0indeed... maybe a warning somewhere for users if they use debian with a more recent postgres version? will have to test first with postgres 9.1 to validate my theory  \n16:47\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I can't seem to find the 9.1-901-2 jdbc driver  \n16:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: or you could integrate the jdbc into the xwiki repo  \n16:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: 901  \n16:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0901-2 is debian package version  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:48\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0there's only 903 on the download page  \n16:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: we could but until now I tried to use as much as possible existing stuff, we already bundle way too much stuff from debian point of view  \n16:48\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0hmm  \n16:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0actually I hacked the url and this works: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-9.1-901.jdbc4.jar  \n16:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: yep I was about to say you can modify the URL directly  \n16:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok testing this one with xwiki 7  \n16:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: https://gist.github.com/msmeria/e18e690c6722929250f7  \n16:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so you do reproduce Slashman issue at least  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: what version of potgre are you testing with ?  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0postgre  \n16:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would be great if you could try with latest 9.1 see if it's some fixed bug and then try with 9.2  \n16:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: 9.4  \n16:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now I have no idea if 9.1 driver is supposed to officially work with postgre 9.4, that may simply be the issue  \n16:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying to find some compatibility table  \n16:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by the way they seems to recomand using jdbc41 drivers but those are not available even in the most recent ubuntu versions  \n16:59\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like postgre driver on debian are such a mess that indeed maybe the best thing here is simply to bundle it...  \n17:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0yes, that would be cool  \n17:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0we talked about that some time ago  \n17:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0bundle drivers for oracle, mysql and postgresql by default  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as far as I understand the best is to use the latest jdbc41 driver  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: this is different here  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm only talking about debian package  \n17:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ah :)  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and in this specific case the postgre debian package  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now it's using whatever is the standard system one  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in a hope that it's the one that is supposed to work best with the standard version of the server installed  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and also because it's bad practice to bundle things that you can depend on  \n17:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I've tested various mysql jdbc drivers. the first one that works with xwiki 7.0 is 5.1.4  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: ok thanks a lot :)  \n17:27\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0you're welcome  \n17:28\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0actually I realised I'm on Java 8. should I have tested on java 7 ?
