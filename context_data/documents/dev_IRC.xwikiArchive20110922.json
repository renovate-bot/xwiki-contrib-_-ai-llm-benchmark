I found a critical issue on 3.0.1 on IE9. related to WYSIWYG .. is it worth reporting it in JIRA ? or we won't have a 3.0.2  \n13:40\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:41\u00a0<Flaviusx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n13:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this issue doesn't seem to be a regression, but it is similar to a fixed issue: XWIKI-5583 .But in 3.0.1's case it doesn't load at all :)  \n13:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0(I am testing 3.0.1 ATM)  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the short answer is that once 3.2 is released we won't support 3.0 anymore  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually wait  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're already not supporting 3.0  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're currentl supporting 3.2-SNAP + 3.1  \n13:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, this is why I asked, to know if is still worth reporting it  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n13:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if it's in 3.1 too then yes should be reported but it's not going to be fixed in 3.0 branch IMO  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone is free to perform a bug fix release of any past version  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(anyone = any committer)  \n13:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0It's not in 3.1 .  \n13:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, then I won't report it on JIRA  \n13:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then as you want, could be useful to reprort it to indicate a workaround for example  \n13:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, It takes 3 minutes to report it :) \u00a0reporting it then.. just to have this in our JIRA  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i think we'll close it immediately as won't fix  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as duplicate  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's already been fixed  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and there must alreayd be an issue for it  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I don't see the point of creating a jira issue  \n13:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0there was an issue. it seems that the fix wasn't applied for 3.0.1  \n13:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I just created the issue  \n13:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so you can close it  \n13:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:02\u00a0<Flaviusx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<Flaviusx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:15\u00a0<Flaviusx\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:17\u00a0<Flaviusx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:17\u00a0<Flaviusx\\_\\_>\u00a0is now known as <Flaviusx>  \n14:18\u00a0<Flaviusx\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:19\u00a0<Flaviusx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:22\u00a0<Flaviusx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:22\u00a0<Flaviusx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <Flaviusx>  \n14:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<Flaviusx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:28\u00a0<Flaviusx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:28\u00a0<Flaviusx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <Flaviusx>  \n14:34\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: as a curiosity, how toes \u00a0the XWiki server that the cache with a certain ID is no longer used .. so it gets deleted after 5 minutes ?  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we use our cache api  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which internally uses jboss cache  \n14:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: as long as you know the cache id to can completely configure it in WEB\\_INF/ with JBossCache conf files when JBoss impl is used  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: not sure...  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's hard coded right now  \n14:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0It must be a complex mechanism in the backend  \n14:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes but conf files always win if you really want to change it you can always  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok didn't know that  \n14:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you just need to know the id  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the id in this case?
