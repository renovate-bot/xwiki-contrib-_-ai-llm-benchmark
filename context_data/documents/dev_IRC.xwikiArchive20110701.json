Or any other JS expert out there ?  \n13:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Denis: I will, did you commit? or did you make a pull request?  \n13:21\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0here is the patch: http://goo.gl/xmMHm  \n13:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow not a small change  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Showing 17 changed files with 219 additions and 191 deletions.  \n13:22\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not reflective of the real change  \n13:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Denis, by 3.1 you mean 3.1 branch, so the 3.1.1 release right?  \n13:23\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but, yes, I mean 3.1 branch  \n13:23\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0since this breaks LiveTable in FF, which I consider major  \n13:49\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n13:55\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:24\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0how can I change branches within terminal ?  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0git checkout  \n15:57\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0mflorea: Thanks for the review, WDYT now for 3.1, or only 3.2 ?  \n15:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I think it's safe for 3.1  \n15:59\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0ok, I fix the details, commit to both and document the fix like you have suggested  \n16:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0great  \n16:33\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: did you manage to successfully use latest SE with our tests ?  \n16:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: we have 7 validation tests failing ( http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/806/testReport/ ) because when you view the wiki page defining a panel and that panel is present in the left/right column you get duplicated HTML IDs. I don't see how this tests were passing before. What's the procedure in this case? This is clearly an issue on our side.  \n16:35\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0The best solution is to namespace HTML IDs generated by a panel so that they don't duplicate IDs defined in the wiki page content.  \n16:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otp  \n16:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n16:46\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:52\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: yes  \n17:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/blob/master/xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/pom.xml#L40  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:23\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:36\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hello World  \n18:53\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:24\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n20:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:14\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:43\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n23:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
