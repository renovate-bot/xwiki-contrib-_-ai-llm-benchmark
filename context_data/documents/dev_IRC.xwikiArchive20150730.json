The way I see it, once a sdoc is set, all the subsquent executions should use it and never override it, otherwise it kind of loses its meaning.  \n13:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0In my case, a sheet document does $doc.getRenderedContent(content, syntax, etc...) and the result is the used PR (or SR in my case) are the ones of the $doc and not of the sheet document, which is wrong IMO.  \n13:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I could have a look at it to fix it  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: sorry, I don't know the answer, never really focused on sdoc and I don't know that much about it  \n13:43\u00a0<helge>\u00a0vmassol: ok  \n13:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we set it in a couple of places (includes, sheet rendering, at the like) to say that the PR check (and SR check now) are to be done on the author of the sdoc (the document containing the code) and not of the current doc (the document executing the code). However, if we end up in recursive calls, IMO we should not override the sdoc (if it is set) in each recursive step, since we end up canceling its effect for some recursive levels (like $doc.getRenderedContent  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow, second time 3 days that my mac crashes :(  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I must have a problem...  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hope it's not xwiki that does this ;)  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it's usually the HDDs or the cooling, my money is on the cooling these days :)  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not too hot here though  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd say 22 degres inside  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the fan was not even running when it crashed...  \n14:06\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n14:08\u00a0<RamonaConoro>\u00a0has quit  \n14:08\u00a0<RamonaConoro>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: \"the fan was not even running when it crashed...\" dead fan then :)  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: except it's working fine :)  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which I can easily test by starting xwiki ;)  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm my git workspace is broken  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the crash happened during a git operation...  \n14:24\u00a0<helge>\u00a0has quit  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: what about a new method in EntityReference: List<String> extractReferenceNames(EntityType type) ?  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either this or something to convert List<EntityReference> into a List<String>  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0getReversedReferenceChain() \u2014> List<EntityReference> \u2014> List<String>  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the idea would be to make it easy to extract all space names for ex  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0second idea: add a type parameter to getReversedReferenceChain()  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(new signature)  \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure what you mean by a type parameter  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example to call SpaceRefefence.getReversedReferenceChain(EntityType.SPACE)  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to get only spaces  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well there is no reason this return Strings, it would not be very consistent with other methods  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've never said it would return string  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0extractReferenceNames() would  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0getReversedReferenceChain() returns Refs  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand what getReversedReferenceChain is doing in a conversation about getting a list of String instead of a list of reference then  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I mentioned you would do it in 2 steps  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0step 1: get a reverse list of space refs  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0step 2: extract the names from the refs  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"second idea\" sounded like another idea so solve your need of String list  \n14:31\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the truth is that I'm working on the entyity js api and I was planning of adding something like this there and I thouht it would be nicer to have the same api for both java and js  \n14:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0extractReferenceNames would not do any harm if you need it  \n14:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's just another helper  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to think more, there are plenty if ways to achieve what I need  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to find the best one...  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why do you need a list of Strings ?  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure yet :)  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki.js is a bit of a mess  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to understand XWiki.fromEntityReference() ATM  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XWiki.resource.fromEntityReference() and get()  \n14:50\u00a0<RamonaConoro>\u00a0has quit  \n14:56\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: are you still ok to implement http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12362 ?  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that was T15 at http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/NestedSpaces )  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just created the issue  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR the one I fixed recently was http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12354 which was different  \n15:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I remember I started a discussion on devs mailing list but I'm not sure we reach a conclusion.
