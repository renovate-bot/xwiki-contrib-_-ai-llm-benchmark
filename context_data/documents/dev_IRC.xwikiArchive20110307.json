I believe this is the last step for the commons/rendering move  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm working on this now, should be pretty quick  \n09:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: ok, we still have failing test. what worries me is that we have many flickering tests in ui-tests..  \n09:26\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvelociter: have you seen this http://hudson.xwiki.org/view/Functional%20Tests/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/428/testReport/org.xwiki.test.webstandards.framework/DefaultValidationTest/Validating\\_XHTML\\_validity\\_for\\_\\_space\\_Sandbox\\_\\_page\\_WebHome\\_executed\\_with\\_credentials\\_Admin\\_admin/ ?  \n09:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it complains about the search suggest icon.  \n10:07\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelociter: xwiki.org is in 2.6?  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought you said you updated it to 2.6.2  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: what's weird is that import page indicate 2.6.2 and footer 2.6  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hence my question to jvelociter  \n10:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: as stated here http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Velocity+Macro velocity macro has only 2 parameters, output and filter. Is that right? I don't understand why {{velocity wiki=\"false\"}} has a different output than {{velocity}}. AFAIK \"wiki\" is a parameter for the html macro, so IMO it should either be ignored or documented.  \n10:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and theversion numvber is supposed to come from the same place in both  \n10:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: no it's not right, it also have everything from http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Script+Macro except language  \n10:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0good morning  \n10:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: i don't see wht wiki parameter is not valid  \n10:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's exactly the same reason than html  \n10:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you don'tt want to interpret wiki syntax  \n10:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0plus it's very usefull for debug  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: commons wiki created  \n10:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: ok thanks  \n10:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I see, then it's confusing because someone reading the velocity macro docs doesn't know that it extends script macro so it doesn't know there are other valid parameters  \n10:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: I know  \n10:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i never said the documentation was right  \n10:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok :)  \n10:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's older than script macro itself actually  \n10:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0fixed  \n10:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0great, thanks!  \n10:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: now, when I use {{velocity wiki=\"false\"}} why am I getting new lines transformed into BRs?  \n10:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: it's not a velocity macro thing  \n10:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you have a new line so html writer convert it to BR  \n10:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise you will not have a new line  \n10:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0html/xhtml  \n10:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see  \n10:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when you use wiki=false you produce plain text  \n10:32\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: would you agree that {{velocity wiki=\"false\"}} can be replaced by {{velocity}}{{{verbatim}}}{{/velocity}} when the output of the velocity macro is not intended to be transformed to HTML? The best option would be to save the page with syntax plain/1.0 but it doesn't appear by default in the list of available syntaxes. Btw, I'm referring to the XWiki.LiveTableResults page.  \n10:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not exactly the same thing since verbatim block produce <pre> (this thing should not even exist if you ask me...) but visually yes it's pretty much the same thing,making plain/1/0 syntax appear is just a configuration  \n10:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and we should use it a lot more than now  \n10:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0actually you could not have velocity  \n10:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0with plain/1.0 syntax  \n10:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you really need velocity in your use case  \n10:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, it's needed  \n10:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but you can use context instead  \n10:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well when syntax is implemented in context macro actually  \n10:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: my issue is that LIveTableResults fails the webstandards validation test because it contains multiple consecute BRs which are generated from multiple new lines. Using verbatim fixes this  \n10:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyway ussing wiki=false is a lot better than {{velocity}}{{{verbatim}}}{{/velocity}}  \n10:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n10:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, but I don't want new lines to be transformed into BRs  \n10:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0an dyou sure you need several new lines ?  \n10:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0they are generated somehow :) of course I could try to make them disappear  \n10:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0they are generated by empty lines inside the velocity code, so they are used for code formatting, separating different sections of code  \n10:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can use ## to remove them  \n10:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n10:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and still see a separation  \n10:56\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ok enterprise moved to commons pom. so all should be ready for the release  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll still need to move other top level projects to the commons pom but that's not on the path of the XE 3.0M3 release  \n11:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: ok, I'll start writing the release plan and I'll probably start the release after lunch  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: do we have an ETA for the user status feature from sergiu?  \n11:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0no :(  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: we'll need to update a few things in the release plan since there's now both commons and rendering to release too  \n11:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually: commons pom, commons tool, commons core, rendering  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in that order)  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with the issue of the circular dep between commons pom and commons tools  \n11:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep, I'll write the plan and ask you to review it  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can't get the jira issue calendar to work anymore...  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm not sure in which category to put the XPOM jira project\u2026 (I haven't created it yet)  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0initially I wanted a XWiki Commons category  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to put the 4 jira projects in it (2 tools, commons core and commons pom)  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I do this then commons isn't shown as a top level project  \n11:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why ?  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one jira project goes in one category  \n11:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but maybe the current top level project categroy is a XWiki top level category one  \n11:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0haveing a separated category makes it even more separated from XWiki  \n11:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i would also put rendering in it  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right top level means projects here:  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/right/right now/  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but there's no notion of group project in jira  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"I would also put rendering in it\". In what?  \n11:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in the commons category  \n11:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that would be a category with all the rool you can use outside of xwiki  \n11:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/root/tools/  \n11:17\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0has quit  \n11:18\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well how would you name it?  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and how would you name the top level categrory?  \n11:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we already said that rendering was a big commons project with its own life so it could be the commons category you wanted  \n11:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0for the top level one we can simply at \"XWiki\" in the name  \n11:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0between making commons separated from the rest of XWiki and showing it as a top level project the more important and to separate it IMO  \n11:27\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mflorea: sorry, just read your comment  \n11:28\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0is Ciprian around ? he made the image, I've just committed it  \n11:28\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0he should be around  \n11:28\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0vmassol: yes xwiki.org webapp is 2.6.2 IIRC  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok ftm I'll create a XWiki Commons category, seems to be the best compromise I can see. ok tmortagne? the rule is if a top level project has several jira projects it can have a category  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelociter: it says 2.6 in the footer  \n11:28\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0but wikis a\bhave not been updated, they are still in 2.6 snapshot  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n11:29\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0vmassol: Hum I think I know  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still version comes from the war  \n11:29\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0there is a line in the upgrade guide that says to copy WEB-INF/classes  \n11:29\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0it could be that  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally, unless overriden  \n11:30\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0cp -r xwiki/WEB-INF/classes xwiki.new/WEB-INF/  \n11:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: ok  \n11:33\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0I think we've overriden version.properties in WEB-INF/classes to hide the fact we were running a SNAPSHOT  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelociter: could you fix this?

What do you guys think of removing \"HTTP Meta Info\" from XWikiPreferences class?  \n16:26\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0If anyone is using it already, they will still have it because they will keep their old class when upgrading.  \n16:27\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0But it's really bad, it depends on rendering 1.0 system and it is not quite 1.0 rendering and definitely not 2.0 rendering.  \n16:30\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0Hi cjdelisle, I've seen it used quite frequently, to include analytics js snippet, to set some velocity vars, etc  \n16:31\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0even if those already using it would not be affected it's useful  \n16:34\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0It would be easy to add it back in if desired. I really don't like it because it uses rendering1 (and there's no way to work around that) and it introduces security problems.  \n16:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol tmortagne: can you please review the release plan?

i am a bit overwhelmed by all the nice abreviations ;)  \n20:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt|Notebook: you can use what you want, i'm using Eclipse and i wrote a tutorial to have this easy to debug Eclipse project but you can do that with intelliJ too (some of us use it)  \n20:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt|Notebook: take the 2EE one  \n20:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0J2EE  \n20:18\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0okay, well, i think i'll go with eclipse  \n20:18\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0and hope i can make this work on win 7  \n20:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt|Notebook: i think i used to have some issue with maven/WTP on win7 (it was not deploying all the jars) but it's maybe fixed now  \n20:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i can assure you that it's working well on Ubuntu ;)  \n20:21\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0well, i don't actually want to compile and stuff for now  \n20:21\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0i just want a nicer way to browse the code  \n20:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n20:22\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0than doing it web based  \n20:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0than you don't really need to follow this tutorial  \n20:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0just install m2eclipse  \n20:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that will allow you to easily import maven project into Eclipse  \n20:22\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0great  \n20:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but to just read code it's possible IntelliJ is better here sincce it properly handler maven submodule  \n20:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in Eclipse you have to import all modules as separated eclipse projects  \n20:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's taking care properly of the dependencies between the project but you loose the maven project tree visually  \n20:24\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0is that only for toplevel projects or for all?  \n20:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0every single maven pom/module will create an Eclipse project and all that at the same level  \n20:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it's not the best unless you know well the organization already  \n20:26\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0sorry for my ignorance, i am used to Visual Studio and C++ which is really comfortable  \n20:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well Eclipse for java is a lot better than Visual Studio with c++  \n20:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0a looot  \n20:26\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0okay, i think i know what you are getting at... let me try to see what this means for me  \n20:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mayb it will be ok for you anyway  \n20:27\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0i'll give it a shot  \n20:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0note that with the name we give to our maven prooject it's kind of organized anyway  \n20:27\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0worst case scenario, i shoot somebody in anger ;)  \n20:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0:)  \n20:29\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0well, i figure anything will be better than keep surfing the SVN ;)  \n20:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n20:30\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0if you want to read svn on the browser, I have a greasemonkey script for firefox which will so syntax highlighting on the text.  \n20:30\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0it's nice when reading stuff in third party libraries (apache commons)  \n20:33\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0n'ah, not a firefox fan :-P  \n20:33\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0i'll go long ways to avoid FF ;)  \n20:34\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0chrome user?  \n20:34\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0Opera  \n20:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: seems nice, could you send it to me ?  \n20:34\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0really don't like Google either  \n20:34\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I'll attach it.  \n20:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt|Notebook: so you prefer the close source one ? ;)  \n20:35\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0well, usually quite the opposite, actually, but what i like most about Opera is that it's ready to use without any attachments needed for my purposes  \n20:35\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0and it sticks to the standards  \n20:36\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe and if the website doesn't then it won't show it to you.  \n20:37\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0true but at that point i just go about blaming website vendors for not sticking to the standard and browser vendors for creating buggy implementations to which website vendors create hacks  \n20:37\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0;)  \n20:37\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0indeed it is their fault but that doesn't get you the page.  \n20:39\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/XWiki/Caleb\\_James\\_DeLisle/prettify.user.js  \n20:39\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0yeah...  \n20:39\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0It's google's thing i just added an event listener to the top which tinkers with pages when it detects they're not html  \n20:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: thanks  \n20:42\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0sure thing  \n20:48\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0i think http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SourceRepository needs some update, too...  \n20:55\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0hmmm should i get XWiki Eclipse or is that horribly outdated and of no use anymore, anyway?
