Package just takes the xar file as the zip stream gives it, put the macros at the end of the zip file and it'll work.  \ntmortagne - (11:00): cjdelisle: at the begining you mean ? context user is checked, not macro author  \ntmortagne - (11:01): if you put it at the end then context user will be checked when he lost admin rights  \nvmassol - (11:01): in any case this is a quick fix for now, we'll need something more robust later on  \nvmassol - (11:01): (some food for thoughts tmortagne for the new xar importer)  \nsdumitriu - (11:01): cjdelisle: Why bad?  \ntmortagne - (11:01): vmassol: next xar importe will not do any order, no way  \ntmortagne - (11:02): it should be pure streaming  \njvelociter - (11:02): do we agree to mark that issue as blocker and fix for 2.6RC1 2.5.1 ?  \nrrodriguez left at 11:02 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \ntmortagne - (11:02): otherwise we get the same crap we have today where it's impossible to import anything big  \nvmassol - (11:02): tmortagne: hmm right....  \nvmassol - (11:02): still we need to fix the order issue somewhere  \ntmortagne - (11:03): but maven xar plugin can  \ncjdelisle - (11:04): If we put the macros at the beginning then we have to define the macro class first. We will have to hope that the macro class (and any other class used by macros) doesn't have any dependencies which pull in XWikiPreferences.  \nvmassol - (11:05): ok deleted docs tab works now too\u2026.

When you have lists with more than 10 items or items that scrolls, the user needs to go up in order to recall what category they where in.  \nevalica - (19:01): for the grouping: you could have a variant where you don't have icons at all, but just the worlds \\*\\*Pages:\\*\\* \u00a0.... \\*\\*Attachments:\\*\\* - you shold think of this too (because once Gregory said we could have an option in the admin to not display icons at all )  \nsdumitriu left at 19:10 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nevalica left at 19:14 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmarta\\_ left at 19:14 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nlucaa1 - (19:18): guys, wdyt is the best approach for running the registerExistingMacros only on current wiki?  \nlucaa1 - (19:18): a function to register the current wiki macros or a function to register the macros on a wiki specified by its name?  \nlucaa1 - (19:18): The only thing I fear is that the second approach will actually need the caller to use the old model/core to get the name of the current wiki...
