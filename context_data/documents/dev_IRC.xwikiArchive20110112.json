I'd like to move your dropPermissions in contentview.vm so that it's after the title computation  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as otherwise it fails if the title requires some rights to execute  \n09:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That's ok since changing the title causes contentAuthor to change.  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok doing it  \n09:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I will make a note to add to the security page that title is considered part of \"document content\".  \n10:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I love that dropPermissions() line. Everything after that line pretty much doesn't need to be reviewed for security :D  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I hope it's correct  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see some renderText() call for displaying footnotes for ex  \n10:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0How so?  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I hope that we don't need the author to be set for that somehow  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mean we need to be sure we don't need the user to be active for the rest  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like the bug we introduced for the title  \n10:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It doesn't actually change the author IIRC it just makes PR go away and makes \\*AsAuthor do as if author was guest.  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not just PR  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you say in the javadoc that the user is considered as XWiki Guest  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that not correct?  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* Drop all author permissions by switching author to guest.  \n10:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0No, thinking about it I don't think it is. Let me check again.  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so for ex if an api requires admin rights it'll work after dropPermissions?  \n10:06\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Indeed I need to reword that.  \n10:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hasProgrammingRights() will always return false, getDocumentAsAuthor, saveAsAuthor and deleteAsAuthor will act as if the author was guest.  \n10:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That is all.  \n10:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Indeed that comment is plain wrong. I think it was a case of \"refactored the code, left the comment the same\".  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Changing that right now before I forget.  \n10:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0good morning everyone from the platform :)  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd ceate a jira issue if I could....  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but infra is down :(  \n10:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, cjdelisle ..
