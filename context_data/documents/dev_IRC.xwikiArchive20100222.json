 \nlucaa - (10:46): I see 3 options:  \nlucaa - (10:46): 1/ at IO service level, to make sure that the service doesn't provide data to unauthorized users \u00a0(I would be checking against XWikiContext.getUser)  \nlucaa - (10:46): 2/ at AnnotationService level: but this would make the service depend on the context (and the user on the context)  \nlucaa - (10:46): 3/ at velocity bridge & rest service level, which would check rights before calling the ANnotationService  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:51  \nlucaa - (10:57): sdumitriu: ideas?  \nsdumitriu - (10:58): Hm...  \nsdumitriu - (10:58): Currently the core-core does not do right checks  \nsdumitriu - (10:58): Those are either in the API or in the web actions  \nlucaa - (10:59): now, I'd be for solution no 3/ since I think it's the way we do it in the wiki...  \nlucaa - (10:59): yes, my thoughts exactly  \nsdumitriu - (10:59): I'd go for either 2 or 3  \nsdumitriu - (10:59): For 2, can't you use the execution context?  \nlucaa - (11:00): the way REST service does it for the standard resources is to get the api.XWiki and get a document from there, which is right-checking API  \nlucaa - (11:01): well, for 2 or 3 I think I would be defining an AnnotationRightsService (:( overenineering) to provide rights checking implementation specific to annotations...  \nlucaa - (11:01): and I'd implement AnnnotationRightService using the XWiki model  \nlucaa - (11:02): (since AnnotationService is an abstraction over XWiki storage or other type of storage, I wouldn't like to put a dep of the xwiki rights service in there...)  \nlucaa - (11:03): but it's a good q, could I use \\_just\\_ the execution context to get rights without dep on old core?  \nsdumitriu - (11:03): Rights, no  \nsdumitriu - (11:03): Just the user  \nsdumitriu - (11:03): And only after changing the core  \nsdumitriu - (11:03): Since the user is not stored in the underlying map  \nlucaa - (11:03): :)  \nlucaa - (11:04): so answer is no  \nsdumitriu - (11:04): The answer is yes with ammendments  \nlucaa - (11:04): :)  \nsdumitriu - (11:04): Do you know the joke about Ivan who won a brand new car?  \nlucaa - (11:04): I think I do... but I'd love to hear it again  \nsdumitriu - (11:06): Call on Radio Erevan: Is it true that Ivan Ivanovich won a brand new car?  \nsdumitriu - (11:06): Radio host: Yes, that is true, but it wasn't Ivan Ivanovich, but Alex Alexeyevich, it wasn't a car, but a bike, and he didn't win it, it was stolen from him  \nlucaa - (11:06): yes, yes, always a good laugh  \nlucaa - (11:07): btw devs, new annotation demo on the incubator, working fine on all browsers!!! enjoy and please feedback on how it feels to use (there's a thread for that on the ml)  \nsdumitriu - (11:07): So yes, you can use the execution context if you really want  \nlucaa - (11:07): except I don't get the value from the EC, I put it :)  \nsdumitriu - (11:07): Right  \nlucaa - (11:08): do we have a standard practice for the rights checking in extensions?  \nlucaa - (11:08): API level, storage level?  \nlucaa - (11:11): I'm looking at the plugins code, and I see the idea is to do rights checking at PluginApi level  \narkub joined #xwiki at 11:12  \nlucaa - (11:12): which is API level, in my case meaning either 3/ or an extrawrapper on top of AnnotationService  \nlucaa - (11:16): but is it safe to have the AnnotationService depend on the context (if I could use the EC)? I mean, is there any situation where the context would be void and I would still get to call the service, etc? I don't see a direct connection between the service and a context...  \nlucaa - (11:45): guys, lucene search is dead on xwiki.org http://pastebin.com/m5b2a3ea4  \noxi joined #xwiki at 11:59  \noxi left at 12:02 (Client Quit  \narkub left at 12:04 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nmflorea left at 12:04 (Quit: Leaving.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 12:15  \nlucaa - (12:17): sdumitriu: can you please check r 27202 I just committed (doc for the rights service) to see if I'm fully correct?  \nsdumitriu - (12:17): K  \nlucaa - (12:17): thanks  \njvdrean left at 12:20 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:28): sdumitriu: or anyone else care if I commit XAADMINISTRATION-112 now?  \nsdumitriu - (12:29): CalebJamesDeLisl: Yes, go ahead  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:29): All right, thanks.  \nsdumitriu - (12:29): I didn't have time to look at it fully, but from what I've seen it looks good  \noxi joined #xwiki at 12:39  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 12:46  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 12:49  \nsdumitriu - (12:53): lucaa: \"current document in the context\" => \"context document\"  \nsdumitriu - (12:54): \"has programming rights in this wiki\" => \"has programming rights\"  \nsdumitriu - (12:54): Programming rights are farm-global  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:56): That brings up an interesting point. Why do new users have edit access right objects for admin group on their user pages? Isn't it taken care of on the space/wiki level?  \nsdumitriu - (13:02): Yes, that's not really needed  \nsdumitriu - (13:05): lucaa: \"the list of all the possible access levels\" => \"the list of all known access levels\", or \"existing\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:11): I have noticed users getting confused about those rights objects in user pages, thinking the new users had admin rights. Also I remember a spammer tried to change the rights object to protect his page seconds before he got deleted.  \nsdumitriu - (13:20): lucaa: One objection, checkLogin only shows the login if the user is guest  \nsdumitriu - (13:21): From the current documentation, it looks like the login is displayed whenever the user doesn't have access right, even if logged in already  \nsdumitriu - (13:21): Try to rephrase it  \nlucaa - (13:35): sdumitriu: ok, will do (I tried to infer that from the code, I didn't really know what it does)  \noxi left at 14:08 (Quit: oxi  \nbblfish left at 14:30 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 14:31  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 14:54  \nEnygma` left at 15:00 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \nbblfish\\_ joined #xwiki at 15:16  \nbblfish left at 15:16 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nbblfish\\_ is now known as bblfish ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nshelan joined #xwiki at 15:17  \nbblfish left at 15:30 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 15:35  \nbblfish left at 16:01 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 16:02  \nshelan left at 16:09 (Quit: Leaving  \noxi joined #xwiki at 16:26  \nplunden left #xwiki at 16:28  \njvelociter - (16:35): Hi CalebJamesDeLisl  \njvelociter - (16:36): I'm on a XE 2.2  \njvelociter - (16:36): trying to activate the captcha on registration  \njvelociter - (16:36): their is no UI for this yet ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:37): Back from breakfast.  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): jvelociter: Nope  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:38): jvelociter: check that xwiki.properties has captcha.enabled=true  \njvelociter - (16:38): ok it's xwiki.properties  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:39): Also you won't see a captcha if you are logged in and adding users.  \njvelociter - (16:39): maybe we could add a configuration source from the wiki on top of tjat  \njvelociter - (16:39): (because here we can't have per-wiki captcha activation in virtual mode for example)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:40): I think I made a mistake adding captcha.enabled to begin with, I'd like to remove it and have all configuration in the registration page config.  \njvelociter - (16:41): IMO it's ok to have it in xwiki.properties, but it's not enough  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:42): Theoretically the xwiki.properties key was for the entire system but there is no way to disable the captcha components so it is just returned when a velocity script asks captchaservice.isEnabled  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:43): --> captcha components are separate and still work with it false.  \njvelociter - (16:45): yes but this parameter would make sense in virtual mode for example  \njvelociter - (16:45): if captcha.enabled=true, then captcha is activated on all sub wikis  \njvelociter - (16:45): all wikis  \njvelociter - (16:45): and then we decide if we allow to override this parameter on a per wiki basis  \narkub left at 16:45 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \njvelociter - (16:45): in the administration section  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:46): I'm about to add captcha on/off for the registration page configuration (which will show up on administrationApp/registration)  \njvelociter - (16:47): mmh I find the captcha of jcaptcha 2,0 still pretty hard  \njvelociter - (16:47): they were supposed to make it easier  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:47): I think it makes more sense to turn it off for each application rather than turning off the service entirely.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:48): re harder: sometimes it makes an impossible one, but we are using an alpha snapshot for now, maybe they'll fix that.  \njvelociter - (16:49): ok  \njvelociter - (16:49): still most of them are easier than in jcaptcha 1  \njvelociter - (16:49): so that's already some progress  \njvelociter - (16:49): but yes some are very hard with letter overlaping one each other  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:49): Easier than the jira captcha.

I'll change any translated versions.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:08): I guess I'll have to leave the old version for one release to prevent xar incompatibility.  \njimi\\_ joined #xwiki at 21:17  \njimi\\_ left #xwiki at 21:17  \nsematicweboholic - (21:19): http://pastie.org/837465.. any idea?.. running jetty(7.0.0.v20091005) on ubuntu 9.04  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 21:21  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:22): sematicweboholic: Linux doesn't allow very many open files by default, you can increase the number.  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 21:23  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:25): Here's some info http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-increase-the-maximum-number-of-open-files/  \nsematicweboholic - (21:25): CalebJamesDeLisl, oh forgot to mention.. i also increase the limit to 65K  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:26): Hmm, that sounds like a problem.  \ntmortagne left at 21:26 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsematicweboholic - (21:27): CalebJamesDeLisl, that exception will shown like zillions of times in a single request :(  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:28): I suppose you know network connections constitute open files.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:28): You increased the number for the user that the wiki is running on or just globally?  \nsematicweboholic - (21:29): CalebJamesDeLisl, oh that might be the problem.  \nsematicweboholic - (21:29): CalebJamesDeLisl, i'll verify it again.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:30): I seem to remember the user only gets 4096 by default, I switched it to 8120  \nsematicweboholic - (21:30): 1024 on my case.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:31): That would do it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:31): How much up time?  \nsematicweboholic - (21:32): oh in ubuntu ulimit only set the on CURRENT terminal and for CURRENT user.. so you are right.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:34): hah cat /etc/security/limits.conf  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:34): jetty has 8192  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:34): (Using Fedora)  \nsematicweboholic - (21:38): CalebJamesDeLisl, seems like its working.. no problem till now.. thanks  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:39): Good. Maybe I should write something in the documentation.  \nsematicweboholic - (21:43): CalebJamesDeLisl, that would great! .. and also there was some problem related with \"aliased resource\" .. is it common issue?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:44): I never ran into it.  \nsematicweboholic - (21:46): :) may be its related with previous issue.. nevermind..  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:46): Out of curiosity, what's your database?  \nsematicweboholic - (21:47): mysql  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:47): seems like everyone uses Oracle and Tomcat, or at least everyone with problems :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:48): I tried mysql but I couldn't get it to log to the console so I'll stick with postgres.  \nsematicweboholic - (21:48): mysql and jetty [soon to be on Tomcat]  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:48): I'm thinking of switching to Tomcat just so I can give better support.  \nsematicweboholic - (21:51): I think it widely popular for normal uses.  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 21:55  \nsematicweboholic - (21:57): CalebJamesDeLisl, I have a weird requirement, where i need to use some our own java code to perform some action through xwiki (eg some sort of form which calls custom code at backend). I am new to xwiki.. so any links or documentation about that?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:58): I'm not quite sure where you want the custom code, in XWiki or outside making calls?  \nsematicweboholic - (21:59): could be both.. but making calls outside is more preferable.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:59): And the code is already written?  \nsematicweboholic - (22:00): yes  \nsematicweboholic - (22:00): whole idea is to use the xwiki framework for user authentication and authorization.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:00): Depending on what you want to do, you micht be able to call in using the XMLRPC or REST apis.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:02): Just using it for authentication? You could use includeServletAsString to redirect to your custom site.  \nsematicweboholic - (22:02): CalebJamesDeLisl, ya i created REST apis for those.. but the problem is its exposed, i need to somehow verify that its indeed the user from xwiki.  \nsematicweboholic - (22:03): i mean valid user  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:03): How about creating a page with some script to do verification and calling it with XMLRPC?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:04): I think there's a method for getting rendered content, not so sure about passing in information.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:05): Maybe the easiest way would be to create a script which checks authentication, put it on a page and send http calls to that page.  \nsematicweboholic - (22:05): you mean creating a page in xwiki ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:05): Yes.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:05): With programming rights, you can access any part of the core using Groovy.  \nsematicweboholic - (22:06): Any examples in xwiki site?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:07): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:07): There are some links to javadoc.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:11): If you want to only output the response from your script, you can call xwiki/bin/view/My/Script?xpage=plain  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:12): Or in your script you can get the output stream, write to it and then close it, something like: response.getOutputStream()  \nsematicweboholic - (22:12): CalebJamesDeLisl, I am getting what you are tryin to say.. (i didn't know that xwiki has script APIs)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:13): Lots of tools, have fun.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:22): glerouge: Any comment on proposal C (display captcha when user clicks on comment entry field?)  \nglerouge - (22:24): sounds good to me too, but I'm not the purist sdumitriu is  \nglerouge - (22:24): and what happens without JS ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:27): My imagined implementation is without JS, the user clicks on comment (as usual) and gets the captcha right away.  \nmflorea left at 22:31 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:35): sdumitriu: got your mail, the \"reply-to\" on the last message was your address instead of devs-bounces and I just hit reply. Also any comment on proposal C for anonymous captcha comments?  \nglerouge - (22:38): CalebJamesDeLisl: right, without JS it's on another page anyway  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:39): Yes, and that same page is loaded by ajax and placed on the view page so the js would just suppress the image and field until the user focused on the text box.  \nsdumitriu - (22:39): Caleb, I'll reply soon, I have to cook something  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:39): All right, enjoy.  \nSvenDowideit left at 22:49 (Changing host  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 22:49  \nanamarias - (23:09): sdumitriu: cool !! :)  \njvelociter left #xwiki at 23:43  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 23:44  \n\n"}
