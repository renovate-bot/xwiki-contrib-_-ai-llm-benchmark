It's a pretty big application, and you learned it quickly  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:02): Um, thanks for the complement. I guess I started reading XWikiDocument and followed all of the method calls.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:03): That's why the component manager confused me for so long.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:03): Everything just kind of ended.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:03): @Requirement ... \"what is this?!!\"  \nsdumitriu - (00:06): Yes, strange how objects just pop in there  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:07): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:14): I have very little formal programming training, a few semesters in college. However I was playing with qbasic when I was 11, mostly just playing Frankenstein with other people's source code to see what I could get it to do.  \nsdumitriu - (00:19): Formal training doesn't always help  \nsdumitriu - (00:19): I just interviewed a guy today, who studied acting, but did unexpectedly good on the interview  \nsdumitriu - (00:21): So the good news is that soon we might have a fellow actor on our team  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:27): A wider variety of backgrounds must contribute to a wider variety of ideas.  \nprototypoholica left at 00:55 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nnickless left at 01:07 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nsdumitriu left at 03:08 (Read error: Operation timed out  \nbbc581 left at 05:20 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 06:10  \nsematicweboholic joined #xwiki at 06:10  \nsanyam joined #xwiki at 06:40  \nsanyam left at 07:53 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 08:19  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 08:42  \nnpm left at 08:49 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsanyam joined #xwiki at 08:52  \nsanyam - (08:53): hi,,  \nsanyam - (08:53): I am intrested in participating in gsoc 2010 ..  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 08:53  \nsanyam - (08:54): I saw the idea page fir xwiki and I raelly liked few ideas  \nsanyam - (08:54): 1.Calender application 2. Google wave integration are on top of my favoutires  \nsanyam\\_ joined #xwiki at 08:59  \nsanyam left at 08:59 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nsanyam\\_ left at 08:59 (Client Quit  \nsanyam joined #xwiki at 08:59  \nsanyam - (09:00): Hi..My name is sanyam . I am interested in applying for gsoc 2010 \u00a0with Xwiki as mentor..  \nsanyam - (09:00): I saw the idea page \u00a0and like few projects there..  \nvmassol - (09:00): Hi sanyam  \nvmassol - (09:00): cool  \nsanyam - (09:01): 1) I liked Calender application and 2) Google wave integration  \nsanyam - (09:02): I have skills in Java, J2EE \u00a0and javascript..  \njvelociter - (09:02): hi vmassol refactored a little my import tests this morning  \nvmassol - (09:02): jvelociter: yep saw that, will look in more details later on  \njvelociter - (09:02): cool  \nvmassol - (09:02): jvelociter: so these tests are supposed to be used for real right?  \nvmassol - (09:03): (meaning they have no equivalent in the other selenium tests)  \njvelociter - (09:03): right  \njvelociter - (09:03): they are new tests  \nvmassol - (09:03): ok so it means we should vote to move from sandbox to enterprise/  \nsanyam - (09:03): Hi Vincent  \njvelociter - (09:03): first we shouldmake the build actually execute the tests  \nvmassol - (09:03): we still need some tuning before that though  \njvelociter - (09:04): yes  \nvmassol - (09:04): yes  \nvmassol - (09:04): and only one webdriver instantiation  \nsanyam - (09:04): Could I know more about how should I get involved ??  \nvmassol - (09:04): ie a suite  \nvmassol - (09:04): sanyam: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/ ?  \njvelociter - (09:04): + right now to execute the import tests in eclipse one has to execute maven install so that resources get copied to target-eclipse  \nvmassol - (09:04): jvelociter: ah ok  \nvmassol - (09:05): that explains why your tests were failing for me  \njvelociter - (09:05): yes  \nvmassol - (09:05): this is easy to fix  \njvelociter - (09:05): forgot to mention that in my commit  \nvmassol - (09:05): and we can easily remove some part of your code  \njvelociter - (09:05): how do you fix this ?  \nvmassol - (09:05): ie no need to create temp files  \njvelociter - (09:05): yes I removed that  \njvelociter - (09:05): this morning  \nvmassol - (09:05): oh ok  \nvmassol - (09:05): so no need for copying either  \nvmassol - (09:05): you just need to pass to surefire the location of the resources dir  \njvelociter - (09:05): ah ok  \njvelociter - (09:05): great  \nvmassol - (09:06): are your tests stable?  \nvmassol - (09:06): (do they work all the time?)  \nvmassol - (09:06): I've executed them on some oldish XE 2.3 (ie without your fix for import) and they're failing in 2 places  \nvmassol - (09:07): but not with the same result when I execute them several times in a row  \nvmassol - (09:07): btw the delete package  \nvmassol - (09:07): should be done in some teardown  \nvmassol - (09:07): or in finally block at worse  \nvmassol - (09:07): otherwsie they don't get deleted  \nvmassol - (09:07): (when the test fails befre)  \nvmassol - (09:07): they should be part of the test fixture  \njvelociter - (09:08): yes  \nvmassol - (09:08): sanyam: no mentor have been assigned yet even though some mentors have shown interest for speceific project already  \njvelociter - (09:08): I'll change that  \njvelociter - (09:09): yes the tests are stable  \njvelociter - (09:09): provided they did not failed the first time  \nvmassol - (09:09): ok that's good  \nvmassol - (09:11): sanyam: yes you can use the mailing list if you want to send a proposal  \njvelociter - (09:22): vmassol: did I miss the decision to bundle Mail.WebHome in different languages in XE ?  \nvmassol - (09:22): jvelociter: I think  \njvelociter - (09:23): I see there are 5 more languages besides english  \njvelociter - (09:23): oh, ok  \njvelociter - (09:23): so that's normal  \nvmassol - (09:23): although I\"m not sure  \nvmassol - (09:23): I don't think we had finished our discussion  \nvmassol - (09:23): and thomas probably pushed it  \nvmassol - (09:23): but I may be wrong  \nvmassol - (09:24): in any case if you don't think it's right, you can raise it on the list  \nvmassol - (09:24): the alternative is costly: ie have different distribution XARs  \nvmassol - (09:25): OTOH we should probably provide a way for users to remove all translations for a given language in the admin or something like that  \nvmassol - (09:25): or even better  \njvelociter - (09:25): no it's ok. actually it's good, it makes a old bug in countDocuments pop up  \njvelociter - (09:25): now I have to fix it :)  \nvmassol - (09:25): ask when you do the import  \nvmassol - (09:25): to have a filter on import  \njvelociter - (09:25): yes  \njvelociter - (09:25): by language  \njvelociter - (09:25): that would be nice  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:28): Is it okay for a selenium test to create a velocity script to do something it has to do over and over in order to improve performance?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:34): I made the RegisterTest test liveValidation, then change the configuration in the admin section (testing that) then test with liveValidation disabled, and still under 4 minutes but that's because the JohnSmith user is deleted and liveValidation active status is checked for each test by a pair of scripts.  \nsanyam left at 09:35 (Quit: Page closed  \nvmassol - (09:35): 4 minutes for RegisterTest, indeed that's long  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:35): pentium 4 :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:36): That's what it was before (3 and something.)  \nvmassol - (09:36): just make sure you test only what's needed  \nvmassol - (09:36): ie there's no need to retest the same thing in several tests  \nvmassol - (09:36): (not sure if this applies here I haven't checked the code)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:37): That's the time for running the test that maven returns so it includes setup.  \nvmassol - (09:37): re velocity script I don't know, I would say it's best to avoid this trick as much as possible since it introduced complexity  \nvmassol - (09:37): so if you havea nother way of achieving the same result it's better to use this other way  \nvmassol - (09:37): s/introduced/introduces/  \nvmassol - (09:37): I'd need to look at your code to provide better ideas though  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:38): I can do that, it just means login as admin and view the admin app for each of 8 tests.  \nvmassol - (09:38): but yes what's really iumportant  \nvmassol - (09:38): is to reduce the test execution time to the minimum  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:39): I hate for the tests to depend on their order (if livevalidation active status isn't checked per test.)  \nvmassol - (09:39): order is not a problem at all  \nvmassol - (09:40): for functional tests  \nvmassol - (09:40): you can force the order  \nvmassol - (09:41): (for unit tests I'd hate to depend on the order though)  \nvmassol - (09:41): the reason is that setting the app/DB in a given state is usually very expensive  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:42): I suppose I can just set livevalidation true, then do the livevalidation tests, then set it false and do the non-livevalidation tests.  \nvmassol - (09:55): jvelociter: I was wrong, passing the lcoation of the resource dir is not a good idea  \nvmassol - (09:56): also it's not needed  \nvmassol - (09:56): since almost all IDE support maven projects now you don't need to do anything I believe  \nvmassol - (09:57): (and if the dir was passed you'd need to configure your test execution in your IDE to specify the dir which would be even a greater pain)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:09): Forcing order of tests means just putting the methods in that order?  \nvmassol - (10:10): nope  \nvmassol - (10:10): the order of methods is not guaranteed at all  \nvmassol - (10:10): order means using a test suite to control the order  \nvmassol - (10:10): you can do this easily by introducing a suite() method in your TestCase class (in junit 3.x)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:11): Okay, I wasn't sure what I should be searching for, thanks.  \nvmassol - (10:11): (btw the reason the method order is not guaranteed is because methods are disocvered by reflection in the default suite  \nvmassol - (10:11): and reflection doesn't guarantee any order  \nvmassol - (10:11): )  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:12): I see.  \nvmassol - (10:12): in junit 4 it's with @RunWith annotation  \nvmassol - (10:13): but I don't know exactly how to do it with junit4  \nvmassol - (10:13): see http://radio.javaranch.com/lasse/2006/07/27/1154024535662.html  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:13): BTW: I couldn't get any tests to run until I changed selenium back to the older version.  \nvmassol - (10:13): oh?  \nvmassol - (10:13): what's wrong?  \nvmassol - (10:13): is hudson fine?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:13): Seems the new version handles 404s as errors.  \nvmassol - (10:14): hudson shows error  \nvmassol - (10:14): just checked  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:14): I thought hudson was shut down due to lack of mail.  \nvmassol - (10:14): for ex: http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/570/testReport/com.xpn.xwiki.it.selenium/DeletePageTest/testDeleteOkWhenConfirming/  \nvmassol - (10:15): hmmm so we're sending a 404 when we edit a page that doesn't exist?  \nvmassol - (10:15): it's delete here  \nvmassol - (10:15): not edit  \nvmassol - (10:15): I think I remember sergiu doing this  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:16): PageExists isn't working either for the same reason.  \nvmassol - (10:17): we need to understand what's the pb  \nvmassol - (10:21): they've probably added support for error codes  \nvmassol - (10:21): and since we return non 200 error codes it fails now  \nvmassol - (10:22): trying to find their sources  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:24): http://code.google.com/p/selenium/  \nvmassol - (10:24): http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/selenium-rc/trunk/clients/java/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/DefaultSelenium.java  \nvmassol - (10:25): http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/selenium-rc/trunk/clients/java/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/DefaultSelenium.java  \nvmassol - (10:25): ahaha  \nvmassol - (10:25): public void open(String url, String ignoreResponseCode) {  \nvmassol - (10:26): we should try with \"true\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:27): Good find.  \nvmassol - (10:28): the jira issue is http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SEL-684  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:28): Should we just go ahead and use true universally or are there uses for failing with error response code?  \nvmassol - (10:28): \"As of now, open() command navigates directly to the page. Instead of that, provide checkedOpen functionality, which makes AJAX request to the page being opened and if the AJAX request fails then report back the failure along with HTTP code back to the user.  \nvmassol - (10:28): Attached patch contains version-1 implementation for checkedOpen. In this patch, I am making ajax HEAD request to the URL being opened and checking for the HTTP status on completion of the ajax request. If this results in 404 or any other error code then the open() throws SeleniumError exception providing information about the http response code.  \nvmassol - (10:28): \"  \nvmassol - (10:29): for us I think we could ignore the result for now  \nvmassol - (10:29): the real question is whether we're right to return error codes  \nvmassol - (10:29): sergiu seemed to think so but I didn't follow that discussion  \nvmassol - (10:30): it's really strange that selenium broke backward compat with this  \nvmassol - (10:30): they should have added the new method and kept the old behavior  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:31): Yes. That is the only thing I admire about Microsoft, 20 year old APIs mostly unbroken.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:31): Their code must be a mess though.  \nvmassol - (10:32): just commented: http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SEL-684?focusedCommentId=19383&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action\\_19383  \nvmassol - (10:32): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:34): So I'm not the only one.  \nvmassol - (10:38): hmm I don't see the api avail in our version  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:48): I gather we're working with this: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/selenium-rc/tags/REL-1.0.1/clients/java/src/main/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/DefaultSelenium.java  \nvmassol - (10:58): we should be on 1.0.2  \nvmassol - (10:58): check the pom.xml  \nvmassol - (10:58): it says 1.0.2  \nvmassol - (11:00): http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/codehaus/mojo/selenium-maven-plugin/1.0.1/selenium-maven-plugin-1.0.1.pom says 1.0.2 too  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:00): I can't find a version 1.0.2 on the site.  \nvmassol - (11:00): what site?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:00): The source tree on google code.  \nvmassol - (11:00): http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/selenium-rc/tags/ ?  \nvmassol - (11:00): hmm  \nvmassol - (11:00): strange  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:01): I did find another seemingly relevant issue: http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SRC-563  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:02): Interesting link on the page \"farewell to the soft 404\" says soft 404s confuse googlebot.  \nvmassol - (11:03): sources can be found here: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/seleniumhq/selenium/client-drivers/selenium-java-client-driver/1.0.2/  \nvmassol - (11:05): so indeed it's not there  \nvmassol - (11:06): one solution is to extend DefaultSelenium to get access to the commandprocessor I guess  \nvmassol - (11:06): but that's a pain  \nvmassol - (11:06): 1.0.3 has been released too  \nvmassol - (11:06): let me check if it's in there  \nvmassol - (11:06): (but it's not in a maven repo yet)  \nvmassol - (11:08): carlos has also updated the selenium maven plugin to use 1.0.3  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:09): Hmm, lights flickering and national grid is reporting outages on 3 sides of me, I might loose power for the day.  \nvmassol - (11:09): oops :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:09): s/loose/lose  \nvmassol - (11:09): haha  \nvmassol - (11:10): you live in the UK right?  \nvmassol - (11:10): ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:10): Do they loose power a lot?  \nvmassol - (11:10): seems so  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:10): \\*lose  \nvmassol - (11:11): they loose power  \nvmassol - (11:11): but you lose power  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:11): Funny thing is the wire I'm on feeds a bunch of Vermont so it gets fixed fast even though I live in the middle of nowhere.  \nvmassol - (11:12): actually 1.0.3 is only the server  \nvmassol - (11:12): the latest client is still 1.0.2  \nvmassol - (11:14): ok will try extending DefaultSelenium  \nvmassol - (11:23): I'm running the full functional test suite locally to see if my change fixes the pb  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:26): Cool, I couldn't get one test to run.  \ndaning joined #xwiki at 11:37  \nvmassol - (11:46): hmm it fails locally but with other errors  \nvmassol - (11:46): I don't know if they're caused by my change or not  \nvmassol - (11:46): they don't seem  \nvmassol - (11:46): I'll commit  \nvmassol - (11:46): and revert if it doesn't gelp  \nvmassol - (11:46): help  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 11:51  \nvmassol left at 11:52 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 11:52  \ndaning left #xwiki at 11:53  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:54): Still not finding anything about how to order test cases, Everything I see is how to order the Tests (classes) in the suite but not the cases (methods) in the test.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 11:56  \ntmortagne - (11:57): CalebJamesDeLisl: it's not supposed to matter in a proper unit test where all test methods are isolated so i guess there is nothing to order them  \nvmassol - (11:57): tmortagne: we were talking about functional tests  \nvmassol - (11:58): bbiab  \ntmortagne - (11:58): vmassol: just seen last message of CalebJamesDeLisl  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:58): While you were gone I said: Still not finding anything about how to order test cases, Everything I see is how to order the Tests (classes) in the suite but not the cases (methods) in the test.  \ntmortagne - (11:59): yes that's what i saw but i tough you where speaking about junit  \nsdumitriu - (11:59): CalebJamesDeLisl: You should not depend on the order of the tests  \nsdumitriu - (11:59): A test is supposed to be standalone  \nsdumitriu - (11:59): Right vmassol?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:00): Was trying to get a little extra performance by changing state in the middle of a test (so the TestCases would not need do a check each time.)  \ntmortagne - (12:01): CalebJamesDeLisl: you committed new resgistration admin translation keys only on trunk ? :(  \ntmortagne - (12:01): just tested 2.2.1 release  \ntmortagne - (12:02): hmm wait  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:02): That went into 2.2.1? I thought that was already released.  \ntmortagne - (12:03): CalebJamesDeLisl: is it normal to have lot's of things $msg.get('core.register.title') in the input of http://127.0.0.1:8080/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=Registration page ?  \ntmortagne - (12:03): CalebJamesDeLisl: what was already released ?  \ntmortagne - (12:04): actually i guess it's normal  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:04): Yes, normal  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:04): It's configuration.  \ntmortagne - (12:04): sorry, seemed weird at first sight to see so many $msg.get ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:04): Gave me a good scare :)  \ntmortagne - (12:05): :)  \ntmortagne - (12:05): what did you fixed yesterday ? so that i test that  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:05): If it wasn't working you would see no title or welcome message on the registration page.  \ntmortagne - (12:06): ok great  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:06): Now I should backport those keys before I forget and you try to release 2.2.2 correct?  \ntmortagne - (12:06): i was afraid that maven took the old web-standard from some cache instead of the one i re-released  \ntmortagne - (12:06): you have time before 2.2.2 there is no date for it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:07): I'll go ahead and do it before I forget.  \ntmortagne - (12:07): actually WDYT exactly ?  \ntmortagne - (12:07): theses translations keys are not part of 2.2.1 ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:07): No.  \ntmortagne - (12:07): so it doe snot work ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:08): I only added the code to use them after you released.  \ntmortagne - (12:08): ok so this asmin UI simplydo nothing, nothing is broken ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:09): If you are admin and you go to bin/register/XWiki/Registration you will see a couple of links at the bottom.  \ntmortagne - (12:09): yes i see them  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:10): I made them into translation keys seeing how other applications translate admin features.  \ntmortagne - (12:11): sure but these link are not broken, i can see \"You \u00a0can configure this application by clicking here.\" and \"You \u00a0can add, remove and change fields in this form by clicking here.\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:11): Good, those are what I changed.  \ntmortagne - (12:11): ok  \ntmortagne - (12:12): testing a couple of other things and i will start announcements  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:14): So am I to understand that there should be no dependance on the order of execution of methods in a selenium test?  \ntmortagne - (12:16): CalebJamesDeLisl: from JAVA POV yes but since we keep the same database to not take days to execute tests there is a kind of dependance  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 12:16  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:19): I can log in as admin and set livevalidation for each test or set it twice and try to make the test cases execute in order. Any preference?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:19): test meaning test case (method).  \ntmortagne - (12:20): CalebJamesDeLisl: best would be to make tests cases as independent as possible IMO  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:21): Can do. I'll run a test and tell what the performance difference is.  \ntmortagne - (12:22): CalebJamesDeLisl: ok  \nsdumitriu - (12:36): tmortagne: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise221 is wrong  \nsdumitriu - (12:36): (the title)  \ntmortagne - (12:37): sdumitriu: \u00a0indeed, thanks for the catch i'm fixing it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:55): Well the test runs in 5 1/2 minutes or 3 1/2 minutes with the hack to eliminate checking the liveValidation parameter each time.  \nvmassol - (12:55): sdumitriu: for unit tests yes, for functional tests, it's a common good practice to define the order of execution  \nvmassol - (12:55): functional tests by definition require an environment  \nvmassol - (12:55): and restoring the environment to a given state before each is usually too expensive  \nvmassol - (12:56): so usually the env is restored only at the beginning of the test suite  \nvmassol - (12:56): lunch time  \ntmortagne left at 13:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmflorea left at 15:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsematicweboholic left at 15:20 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \ndaning joined #xwiki at 15:50  \ndaning - (15:56): Hello  \nsdumitriu - (15:57): Hi  \ndaning - (15:58): I am in http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XE/XWikiCoreResources, I am trying to add some Chinese translation.  \ndaning - (15:58): The Simplified Chinese (zh) Total translations is 2414.
