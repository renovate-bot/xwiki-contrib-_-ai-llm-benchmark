looks like there is still a bug in the part that put back parent version (all parent are 7.3-rc-1 in 7.3.x branches)  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I didn't notice any problem  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in the console log  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I din  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I didn't check the 7.3.x branch afterwards  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0release script is not the easiest thing to validate without actually doing a release...  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fixing 6.4 branch too  \n09:53\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:53\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n09:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm I think I know what is wrong  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0guys would be great if other could review the release script too  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0parent update should be ok for next release I think  \n10:14\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:14\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is it only me or search.maven.org is down ?

 \n12:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:21\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0solved, I had to add the \"programming\" right to everyone  \n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: don't give programming right to everyone, the new right is script right  \n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0programming right is equivalent to being root  \n12:28\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: okay, good to know... changed to script right  \n12:28\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0thanks  \n12:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically script right is a right that everyone used to have and that we decide to separate so that it's possible to allow people to contribute content without writing script  \n12:30\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0okay so it's intended that the script right is not given to all users when updating?  \n12:30\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I'm not sure when the script right should not be given, do you have a jira ticket in mind with a use case?  \n12:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: not exactly, the right is given to everyone by default but you probably had conflict on XWikiPreference and kept previous configuration  \n12:31\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0oh I see, I did have a conflict indeed  \n12:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for the use case you can do lots of stuff with scripting that some admin could not want even if they are not security issue exactly: set some variable to disable part of the UI like comments, override some translations for a given page, etc.  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it also prevent any exploit of some security flow not fixed yet in the product or introduced by some extension or custom script  \n12:48\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:49\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0okay, thanks for the insight  \n12:52\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:17\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I have an issue with the colibri skin when updating from 7.1 to 7.2: the following warn appear in logs: \"WARN \u00a0o.x.v.i.DefaultVelocityEngine \u00a0- Deprecated usage of method [com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki.parseContent] in 79:/skins/colibri/login.vm@25,47\"  \n13:17\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I never get the login prompt  \n13:18\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I'm stuck at \"XWiki is initializing (50%)...\"  \n13:19\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I changed the default skin to flamingo in xwiki.cfg and restarted tomcat but it didn't change anything... I think that the skin was changed in the config, any idea how I can force the use of the flamingo skin so I can get the login prompt?  \n13:22\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0okay, seems to work after a while!  \n13:34\u00a0<kais3n>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: is there any reason we still have https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/blob/master/xwiki-commons-core/pom.xml#L187 they seem to have been added by XCOMMONS-810 which was fixed in 7.1RC1.
