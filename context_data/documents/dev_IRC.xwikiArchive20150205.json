I would like to take an artifact and attach it to X.Y so that the resulting XAR will have X.Y with the artifact as an attachment. Is there an easy way to do this?  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: there is a maven plugin for this and you can find example in old XEM build  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it used to attache XE XAR to create a wiki template from it)  \n14:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: see https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/xwiki-manager/blob/xwiki-manager-4.5/xwiki-manager-ui/pom.xml  \n14:35\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n14:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it get xwiki-enterprise-ui-all artifact and then attach it  \n14:37\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks!
