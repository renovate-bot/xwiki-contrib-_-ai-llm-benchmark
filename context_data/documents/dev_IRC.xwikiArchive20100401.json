It depends if these parameters are required further, during action processing.  \nmflorea - (21:27): or alternatively add a guard. I need this filter to be mapped to include/forward too in order to edit a page from a portlet, which dispatches the action (e.g. save&view).  \nmflorea - (21:30): btw, the form action URL is not changed anymore from JavaScript, right? The ActionFilter is the only one dispatching the submit request to the right action, is it?  \nsdumitriu - (21:31): Yes  \nnickless left at 21:42 (Remote host closed the connection  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 21:44  \nnickless left at 22:03 (Remote host closed the connection  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 22:26  \nDV left at 22:34 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nDV joined #xwiki at 22:34  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 22:38  \nsdumitriu - (22:40): lucaa, jvdrean: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/LogoChallengeRound2  \nsdumitriu - (22:40): The debate is about proposals 12 and 15; Vincent thinks that 12 resembles the current logo too much and should be discarded, tmortagne thinks that 15 resembles Atlassian too much and should be discarded  \nsdumitriu - (22:40): (08:04:17 PM) sdumitriu: So, options are:  \nsdumitriu - (22:40): (08:04:17 PM) sdumitriu: 1/ elliminate 12 and 15 now, although they are the most popular, and continue the second round with the following 3-4 most voted proposals  \nsdumitriu - (22:40): (08:04:17 PM) sdumitriu: 2/ elliminate 12 and 15 and start the vote again  \nsdumitriu - (22:40): (08:04:17 PM) sdumitriu: 3/ keep them and live with the result  \nnickless\\_ joined #xwiki at 22:43  \nnickless\\_ is now known as nickless ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nlucaa - (22:44): sdumitriu: i'm reading history now  \nlucaa - (22:49): (among various conversations about which programming language car or operating system rocks more)  \nanamarias left at 22:55 (Quit: anamarias  \nvmassol1 - (22:58): night time for me, nn  \nvmassol1 - (22:58): fyi http://blog.hibernate.org/15040.lace  \nvmassol1 left at 22:59 (Quit: Leaving.  \nDV left at 22:59 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nsdumitriu left at 23:01 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nDV joined #xwiki at 23:01  \nDV left at 23:10 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nDV joined #xwiki at 23:10  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 23:21  \njvdrean - (23:25): sdumitriu: I agree with Jerome, I don't see the issue with 15  \nlucaa - (23:25): sdumitriu: about the logos thing, I don't like very much the idea of eliminating now. I also don't like very much the idea of restarting the vote because we realize that, \"oh these proposals which we failed to firmly eliminate have made it to the final\", I also think the resemblance on 15 is arguable, eliminating it would be forced since not everybody agrees it's a strong resemblance.  \nlucaa - (23:26): So i'd rather go for 3/ but as mflorea suggested, we should make sure we centralize all comments in the logos page, so that voters could see them, and are aware of these discussions when they vote  \njvdrean - (23:26): +1 for 3/ as well  \nlucaa - (23:26): also, I propose we add a \"draw by hand on a paper\" challenge to all logos (besides the icon, black-white and other requirements)  \nsdumitriu - (23:27): +1  \nlucaa - (23:27): sdumitriu: what for? :)  \njvdrean - (23:28): lucaa: I don't really see the point of being able to draw a logo by hand on paper  \nsdumitriu - (23:28): For draw by hand  \nsdumitriu - (23:28): jvdrean: It means the logo is memorable and reproductible  \njvdrean - (23:28): http://www.redhat.com/g/chrome/logo\\_rh\\_home.png  \njvdrean - (23:29): just to name one  \nlucaa - (23:29): jvdrean: and it means it has distinctive properties, like shape or something else  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 23:29  \nlucaa - (23:29): jvdrean: I'm not saying it should be eliminatory, i'm just saying it's a nice to have  \njvdrean - (23:29): good luck with that one too http://www.coca-cola.com/template1/images/coke\\_red\\_wbg.png :)  \njvdrean - (23:30): sure it'd be nice to have, ok  \nlucaa - (23:30): oh, coca cola is not that hard  \nlucaa - (23:30): I mean, it doesn't have to be the same, it has to be recognizable  \nsdumitriu - (23:30): Wasn't the stripe/wave their thing?  \nanamarias left at 23:30 (Client Quit  \njvdrean - (23:31): got to go, bye  \njvdrean left #xwiki at 23:31  \nlucaa - (23:31): for example, jvdrean, old logo is very very good from this pov, I could basically put dots around any X and made the the XWiki X  \nsdumitriu - (23:31): And that's why the Nike logo is more famous than the RedHat one  \nlucaa - (23:32): ;0  \nlucaa - (23:32): :)  \nlucaa - (23:33): however, I don't think designers should draw themselves, they're too good drawers  \nlucaa - (23:33): let's make vmassol draw :)  \nsdumitriu - (23:33): Or vmassol's kids  \nlucaa - (23:33): yeah, let's use a kid  \nlucaa - (23:38): also sdumitriu  \nlucaa - (23:39): do you think it makes sense to give more credit to the votes from \"community members\"?
