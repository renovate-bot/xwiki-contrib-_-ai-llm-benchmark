Yes, through the class editor  \nxwikibot - (05/11/2008 11:15): XWiki.risc was modified by XWiki.risc (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/risc  \nxwikibot - (05/11/2008 11:43): FAQ.Howtodisablecommentsandattachments was modified by XWiki.hschroers (Added comment) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/Howtodisablecommentsandattachments  \nxwikibot - (05/11/2008 13:46): XWiki.VictorSevilla was modified by XWiki.VictorSevilla (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/VictorSevilla  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 15:31): been quiet here today...  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 15:32): is that because everyone has been following the american election late yesterday ? ;)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:41): vmassol: since you seems to have time today, I risk for one question: why does most object function asserts that BaseProperty is never null ? Or says another way, is this expected behaviour or just a mistakes ?  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 15:42): Denis: re the time not really, I've never been more busy ;) re your question, I don't know. Actually I don't know that part of xwiki at all,s orry  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:44): vmassol: no luck, I am stick in a NPE that I feel is normal but the code does seems to be written like it never happens, so I am searching what I am bypassing...  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 15:46): Denis: good luck! Maybe someone would know on the list?  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 15:47): if you have a rendering question I can answer it though ;)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:48): vmassol: That is rendering but not the one you thought about, it is the display of a field that throws NPE  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 15:48): hehe  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:48): because the object does not has that property, even if its class has it  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:50): what puzzle me is that I have transcoded a velocity stuff in groovy and I do not get the same results (I should admit that there are subtle differences however in the way I do stuffs in groovy compare to velocity)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:55): vmassol: by the way, I have had no time for preparing the patch for latest groovy on the old rendering, but I have something working, I have not forget the idea, if you need it earlier, let me know !  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 15:55): Denis: ah cool  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 15:55): thomasmortagne is working right now on the new groovy support  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:56): is it 1.6 ou 1.5 groovy ?  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 15:57): did not decided yet, 1.6 is beta, right ?  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:57): right  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 15:58): if it is 1.5.6 or 7, I could probably helps in cleaning issues, since groovy leaks sometimes...  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 15:59): for now i'm just looking the best entry point between groovy directly and using https://scripting.dev.java.net/ which sound pretty cool for us  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 16:01): (JSR 223)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:01): yes I know  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:02): it mostly depends what expect from the integration  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:02): since JSR 223 is generic, its less flexible that direct integration of groovy  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 16:03): Denis: what would we be missing?  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:05): I do not think that you may build and cache groovy classes for example  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 16:07): (which btw we shouldn't do according to Guillaume since groovy already has an internal cache)  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 16:07): Denis: that's one thing thomas needs to validate, i.e the flexbility we have using the JSR  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 16:08): for example we're doing pretty complex stuff in our velocity module and we need to know if we can do them using the JSR  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:08): yes and the way to use is in JRE 1.5 too  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:08): in fact, IFIAK, using JSR, you are evaluating script all the time  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:09): Denis: i guess this depends on the way groovy implementation of script engine for JSR is done  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:11): if like Vincent said last versions of groovy has an internal cache for classes we don't need much in JSR api  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:12): I just wonder how groovy could cache, if you only provide souce script, how does it knows he got it already  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:15): AFAIK, normal groovy implementation used the GroovyLoader that is able either to function as a normal URLLoader to load bytecoded classes or can also compile classes from source depending on the context, but from JSR api, I do not see how this would work ? Of course I havent try.  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:16): for I do, it does not matter a lot, I bootstrap my groovy code using a dedicated loader compiled code anyway. This permit me to develop in a decent IDE :)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:17): I feel that a proper integration of groovy with XWiki woud be great if there was a \"Groovy XWiki API\", something I have started to work on :)  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:17): don't know the details of groovy caching (first time i'm using) so lets see :)  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:17): anyway thanks for comments  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:18): i will have this in mind when working on it  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:18): and beware that groovy metaclass could cause leaks  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:19): ok  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:19): since metaclass on POJOs are stored in static variables  \nvmassol - (05/11/2008 16:19): thomasmortagne: we have access to Guillaume Laforge if you need explanation/help  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:20): ok a soon as I'm able to use JSR in 1.5 I will certainly have questions  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:21): thomasmortagne: if you want a copy of my current GroovyTemplateEngine.java and XWikiGroovyRenderer.java, let me know :)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:21): this of course opposed to JSR  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:21): but it tries to mitigate leaks issues  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:22): that came from the usage of groovy in a servlet environment  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:22): yes sure, could you post a patch on http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-1313 ?  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:24): I have that on 1.4, but I have no quick way to produce the patch, that is why I have not  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:24): java files is already good :)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:32): thomasmortagne: I have attached a zip :)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:32): hope it ok :)  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:32): +'s  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:33): ok thanks  \nDenis - (05/11/2008 16:39): thomasmortagne: and feel free to ask if this raise any question :)  \nthomasmortagne - (05/11/2008 16:39): yes sure  \nxwikibot - (05/11/2008 17:40): XWiki.ajperalt was modified by XWiki.ajperalt (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/ajperalt  \n\n"}
