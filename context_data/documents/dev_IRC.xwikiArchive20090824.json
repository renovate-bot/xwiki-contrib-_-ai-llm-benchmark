I have admin rights .. actually I want to delete manually some test spaces which I don't want to appear in my XOO screenshots   \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 11:28): [cristinas] it worked with /Main/Spaces/deleteSpace  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 11:28): [jvelo] cristinas: you can also use the browser design mode mode for that ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 11:29): [cristinas] good to know :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 11:29): [jvelo] document.body.contentEditable = true;  \nasyd - (24/08/2009 11:30): s 16  \nasyd - (24/08/2009 11:30): oups  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 11:31): [tmortagne] could committers move RC1 jira issues to other versions, should be 2.1M1 if it's not bugfixes  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:45): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: hi, do you know how I can access the content of a macro in a wiki macro? $context.macro.content doesn't seem to work...  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:46): [tmortagne] it's supposed to be this, i'm checking  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:49): [Vincent Massol] sorry  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:49): [Vincent Massol] it's workig fine  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:49): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:49): [tmortagne] as far as i can see in the code it should be context.macro.context  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:49): [tmortagne] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:49): [Vincent Massol] made a mistake  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:50): [tmortagne] (to access MacroTransformationContext)  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 14:50): [tmortagne] and for the content yes it's what you put  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:32): [arunreddy] Vincent Massol : Hi  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:33): [glerouge] arunreddy: vincent won't be available today & tomorrow  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:33): [arunreddy] Wiki Importer : http://gsoc.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/WikiImporter+SNAPSHOT-1/0  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:34): [arunreddy] Today is the last day for my gsoc evaluation.  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:34): [arunreddy] :(  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:34): [glerouge] vincent has looked at your work already, hasn't he?  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:35): [arunreddy] Don't know. He didn't leave any comments.  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:37): [glerouge] I'm sure he has  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 15:39): [arunreddy] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:13): [jvelo] Hi guys  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:14): [lucaa] hi jvelo  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:14): [jvelo] do you see something in this query that oracle would not like :  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:14): [jvelo] $xwiki.search(\"select elements(prop.list) from BaseObject as tagobject, DBStringListProperty as prop, XWikiDocument as doc \u00a0where tagobject.className='XWiki.TagClass' and tagobject.id=prop.id.id and prop.id.name='tags' and doc.fullName=tagobject.name and upper(str(doc.content)) like upper('%test%')\")  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:14): [lucaa] do you have an error  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:14): [lucaa] ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:14): [jvelo] nothing more than   \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:14): [jvelo] Wrapped Exception: could not execute query  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:15): [jvelo] (works good on hsqlsb)  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:15): [lucaa] all seems standard hsql (which means hibernate should handle it) except for the last part, with str, lower, etc  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:15): [lucaa] try to remove that part and see if it works  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:15): [lucaa] upper I meant, you have no lower  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:16): [lucaa] ah, and the infamous elements() function, which can be very tricky (but that's, again, hsql who should handle it. IIRC it's a hibernate sql funciton)  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:25): [jvelo] ok, it seems it's the str()  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:26): [lucaa] but what does str do?  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:28): [lucaa] what I mean is, doc.content is already a string, can't you do without it?   \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:31): [Vincent Massol] Does anyone know what \"Relational Storage\" checkbox is in class property for \"List of Users\" type?  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:32): [jvelo] lucaa: the thing is we don't know the type in advance  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:32): [jvelo] we don't know if it's going to be doc.content or doc.date  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:32): [jvelo] that's why I guess ludo forced str()  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:32): [lucaa] jvelo: I see  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:34): [lucaa] jvelo: and anyway you'd need something to work for the date... Did you (or anyone) try without anything? mysql or some other db was really friendly with such casts IIRC  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:34): [lucaa] maybe you're lucky (do you feel lucky?)  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 17:36): [jvelo] I'll try removing the cast on oracle and will test the date  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 20:34): [arunreddy] sdumitriu: Hi  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 20:34): [sdumitriu] Hi  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 20:35): [arunreddy] http://gsoc.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/WikiImporter+SNAPSHOT-1/0  \nxwiki-bridge - (24/08/2009 21:59): [euthymiusadam] hello everybody ... :)  \n\n"}
