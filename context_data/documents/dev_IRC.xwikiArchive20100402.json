I don't mind chznging the logo again later if need be  \ntmortagne - (16:20): the important thing is not that some thing it's not similar but that some thing it is, when we are not sure we should go the remove way IMO  \ntmortagne - (16:21): s/thing/think/  \nDenis - (16:21): tmortagne: \u00a0and 12 is l  \nDenis - (16:21): oups  \nDenis - (16:21): tmortagne: and 12 is similar to Attlassian with for heads ?  \nDenis - (16:22): -for+four  \nvmassol - (16:23): myxwiki.org is quite slow....  \nsdumitriu - (16:24): Denis: 12 seems similar to the current XWiki.com logo, which is owned by the XWiki SAS company, and not by the XWiki open source community  \nDenis - (16:24): tmortagne: similarity is matter of taste, you may always found similarity somewhere, especially with attlasian because they have a logo with a X shape,  \nDenis - (16:24): sdumitriu: I completely agree on that  \ntmortagne - (16:24): Denis: 12 is not a blue human  \nsdumitriu - (16:25): All proposed logos are similar to the Xerox logo, so none of them is good  \nDenis - (16:25): tmortagne: 15 is not a straight X, and not a human with the world on his shoulder  \nsdumitriu - (16:25): All letter logos are similar to other letter logos  \nsdumitriu - (16:25): Every letter has at least one famous company using it in their logo  \nsdumitriu - (16:26): And most fruits too  \nsdumitriu - (16:26): And most animals  \nsdumitriu - (16:26): So no logo is good  \nsdumitriu - (16:26): OK, no more logo  \ntmortagne - (16:26): Denis: look at confluence logo, not atlassian one  \nsdumitriu - (16:26): We just declare that XWiki doesn't have a logo for fear of being sued  \ntmortagne - (16:26): Denis: the human doe snot have the world on his shoulder  \nvmassol - (16:27): sdumitriu: this is not correct. You can trademark a letter. You can trademark letter written in a specific font, with specific colors, etc  \nDenis - (16:27): tmortagne: but it is a straight X  \nvmassol - (16:27): s/can/can't/  \nDenis - (16:27): with some circle under  \ntmortagne - (16:27): Denis: 15 is just a curved version of the same thing  \nDenis - (16:27): still nothing to do with a happy man very curved  \nmflorea - (16:27): sdumitriu, Denis: I really think we should stand out and having a logo that some can say it copies the main competitor is not the right way..  \nvmassol - (16:28): sdumitriu: anyway as I said I'm fine with the strategy: let's continue with round2, use whatever logo is chosen, and change it later on if someone asks us to do so  \nmflorea - (16:28): I'd like us to be different  \nvmassol - (16:28): hey guys I'm trying to help sergiu now  \nvmassol - (16:28): so don't say the opposite now :)  \nsdumitriu - (16:28): Yes, I agree, but let the democracy decide that we don't want that logo  \nsdumitriu - (16:29): Why do you have to assume that they will be chosen?  \ntmortagne - (16:30): Denis: you can find as many minor difference you want, we are not in court, the only thing i see is that it's obvious for me and for other that it's similar and that's enough IMO  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): Given the right arguments, making your concerns heard, do you think that people will still blindy vote with those logos?  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): And if yes, then maybe there really is no problem, the logos are not that similar  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): One, two people seeing the similarity doesn't make them 100% similar  \nDenis - (16:30): tmortagne: 12E is really nearer to XWiki SAS compare to 15 and Attlasian, and I would completely under if XWiki SAS would like to see it removed. On the other hand, I nearly sure Attlassian would have difficult to sue us, or find it is similar, the intend really differ  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): Don't you trust the community?  \nvmassol - (16:31): sdumitriu: given these arguments people would have picked other logos  \nsdumitriu - (16:31): If you don't trust a vote to come with the right answer, then you don't trust votes, and why do we even vote anyway?  \nmflorea - (16:31): sdumitriu: I'm afraid that people will vote only subjectively without considering the constraints the logo should satisfy  \nvmassol - (16:31): which were not picked and that's unfair  \nDenis - (16:32): mflorea: I have vote 15, and I have considered the constraints  \ntmortagne - (16:32): Denis: again i don't care about being sued or not, i just don't want user to think we are stilling confluence logo because that's what i would think  \nvmassol - (16:32): that's why either we say go ahead and accept all the logos if votes or we redo a vote removing the logo with potential issues  \nvmassol - (16:32): s/votes/voted/  \nDenis - (16:33): mflorea: I just do not see it as similar or confusing, and I feel it is really nice and shows that XWiki is about poeple sharing  \ntmortagne - (16:34): Denis: even if we can find arguments to explain it's not that similar i just to want use have to find theses arguments at all  \nsdumitriu - (16:35): evalica: Are you here?  \nevalica - (16:35): yeap  \nevalica - (16:36): sorry .. let me read :)  \nDenis - (16:37): tmortagne: really do not have that feeling, and not all user of XWiki even know about the confluence logo. 15 is a curved X, a W and a I dot, a happy jumping man, \u2026 this is what I see. Attlassian is a man straight on his foot, in the middle of a circle, with his harm up to the sky, his head is not detached, is has various line thinkness, \u2026 there many arguments, but I have just evoked them because you find it similar, not because they are :)  \nmflorea - (16:37): Denis: I understand your point but still think that we should choose an original logo, and not something that others have though about.  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): The debate is about proposals 12 and 15; Vincent thinks that 12 resembles the current logo too much and should be discarded, tmortagne thinks that 15 resembles Atlassian too much and should be discarded  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): So, options are:  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): 1/ elliminate 12 and 15 now, although they are the most popular, and continue the second round with the following 3-4 most voted proposals  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): 2/ elliminate 12 and 15 and start the vote again  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): 3/ keep them and live with the result; we also put a warning in front of these logos  \nsdumitriu - (16:39): evalica: WDYT?  \nDenis - (16:40): mflorea: \u00a0this one is also similar then: http://wigab.com/images/site/2007-01/blog/44-Cingular\\_Dropped\\_Out.jpg  \ntmortagne - (16:40): Denis: i understood that you did not find the logos similar and i'm not trying to prove you it is, i'm explaining why that's the first thing that came to my mind and that i'm sure i'm not the only one. My point is that i want our logo to have nothing to do with Confluence logo and that nobody can doubt it.  \nDenis - (16:40): and I pretty sure we will found tons of them, since an X and a man has many things in common  \nmflorea - (16:40): yes, and I don't like it either  \nmflorea - (16:41): it doesn  \nmflorea - (16:41): it doesn't have to be an X  \nmflorea - (16:41): or a man  \nDenis - (16:42): tmortagne: never came my mind, even after being suggest that I shoud take care  \nvmassol - (16:42): sdumitriu: I've changed my mind  \nvmassol - (16:42): (I told you to go ahead)  \ntmortagne - (16:42): Denis: i don't say it's possible to find the perfect logo that doe snot look like any other logo, i'm just talking about our main contributor logo here, I think that's pretty good reason to be extra safe...  \nDenis - (16:43): tmortagne: \u00a0ok, so, why not asking them if they have the same feeling then ?  \nevalica - (16:44): proposal 19 is similar to http://www.xamance.fr/  \nevalica - (16:44): :)  \nsdumitriu - (16:44): From http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/LogoChallengeRound2#HProposal12A : Some people feel that this logo resembles the XWiki SAS logo. \u00a0Only vote for this logo if you don't find it too similar.  \nevalica - (16:45): so 16 wins :)  \ngvallarelli - (16:45): I think that evaluating all the problems involved proposal 4 is the best  \nevalica - (16:46): the thing is that is unfair to us to remove logos, even though people voted for them.  \nevalica - (16:46): the advantage of us is that we can make up our minds and gather all commiters vote :) and settle things out  \nsdumitriu - (16:47): Yes, this is a maleable democracy  \nevalica - (16:47): I don't want either that we have a logo that is so much similar to Atlassian ... that would be a killer for us in a bad way  \nsdumitriu - (16:47): If we don't like the outcome, we can change the rules  \nevalica - (16:48): but we have to respect what we stated ... and the votes given so far  \nsdumitriu - (16:48): I don't like 12 and 15 that much either, but I trust the community to make the right decision  \nevalica - (16:48): because the voted logos.. are the ones that are implemented the best  \nsdumitriu - (16:48): Yes, 12 had the most votes, but it had the least weighted vote sum  \nsdumitriu - (16:48): So it was like a second or third choice for most people  \nevalica - (16:49): and.... we should request .... the svg's ... for the logos in round 2 ... and make some screenshots... with this logos over the future main page of xwiki.org  \nevalica - (16:49): because... in context some logo would look different than in our imagination  \nsdumitriu - (16:49): Yes, big +2  \nDenis - (16:50): evalica: yes putting logo in context should be done this may change votes  \nDenis - (16:50): even mine :)  \nevalica - (16:50): we can use the proposal 2 for Xwiki.org http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Improvements/XWikiOrgProposal2 ... or something else  \nvmassol - (16:51): and I guess that once a logo is chosen, we can ask the author to make small changes to it  \nevalica - (16:51): :) vmassol .... we should ask those changes before round 2 ... then...  \nevalica - (16:51): because theoretically ... when a logo is chosen ... it should not suffer changes  \nsdumitriu - (16:52): vmassol: The logo will be finalized by our designers  \nevalica - (16:52): because.. after the \"changes\" people may not like it anymore  \nsdumitriu - (16:52): Prepare png, svg, eps, psd  \nDenis - (16:52): round 2 should be including these adjusments  \nsdumitriu - (16:53): Yes, the logo proposed in round 2 should be very close to final  \nsdumitriu - (16:53): We can't vote 15 and then straighten up the man and attach his head back on the shoulders :)  \njvdrean - (16:53): hehe :)  \nlucaa - (16:53): vmassol: wdym? they should be there, shouldn't they? just need to install the 2.3M1 or higher .xar  \nDenis - (16:53): it should also be more restraint that vote 1 in term of variations, or the +1 vote should be on a precise variation  \nsdumitriu - (16:53): But we can slightly change the color  \nvmassol - (16:54): lucaa: I don't see them on myxwiki.org  \nlucaa - (16:54): hm...  \nvmassol - (16:54): only on the main wiki  \nvmassol - (16:54): but not on subwikis  \nDenis - (16:55): sdumitriu: I would not vote for a 15 in blue, or with foots  \nbblfish left at 16:55 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (16:55): lucaa: btw try clicking on Annotationson http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome  \nvmassol - (16:55): it doesn't look too good visually  \nsilviar left #xwiki at 16:55  \nevalica - (16:55): sdumitriu: \u00a0also ...
