Thanks, Helge  \n00:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Not yet  \n00:18\u00a0<helge>\u00a0All right. Just in case: If I would set up a new install of XE 3.4 wit Posgres, would you recomend to apply the patch you told me previously or should it just work fine without i it was not a migration?  \n00:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It should work fine without it  \n00:19\u00a0<helge>\u00a0should read \"if it was not\"  \n00:23\u00a0<helge>\u00a0Ok, good to know. I would probably just make a new install then, if no one else is facing this problem. I do not have too many pages yet and can transfer them copy-paste wise.  \n00:23\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It should work with a XAR export+import, if you run a 3.1 version on the old database  \n00:24\u00a0<helge>\u00a0But I shall do it without history, right?  \n00:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Depends, with history it will require more resources (RAM), so it depends how much you want to keep it  \n00:27\u00a0<helge>\u00a0Well, I would like to keep it, if possible. So you think migrating the database would break it but xar import-export would not?  \n00:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Exactly  \n00:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or, you could try to manually migrate the database  \n00:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You'd have to set up a 3.4 instance on a new database, and see what's the table structure that gets generated  \n00:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And then compare it to the existing one  \n00:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And see if there are any differences  \n00:40\u00a0<helge>\u00a0ok, I guess I'll try the xar-way first and find out if I have enough RAM. Thank you again for helping, I do highliy appreciate that.  \n00:42\u00a0<helge>\u00a0And I like you porject. Congratulations to what you achieved so far!  \n00:42\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Thanks!  \n00:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sorry for the mess, we did a rewrite of the database mapping files to have them more up to date with the current Hibernate standards, and this required some backwards incompatible changes  \n00:51\u00a0<helge>\u00a0All right, I guess you can't get away from that 100%. I will set it up again and probably not touch it for long time, then.  \n00:51\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n00:51\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n00:53\u00a0<helge>\u00a0It's late where I am, so I am out.

I`m curious about something: When you have a component (or worse, a plugin that you want to convert to components) that has methods like getSomething(String documentName, param1, XWikiContext context), can you refactor it to get rid of the context parameter by using an @Inject Execution instead and getting the XWikiContext from the Execution whenever you need it?  \n14:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0is the XWikiContext retrieved from the Execution the one corresponding to the current call context or is it a cached one that was assigned at component initialization time?  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: it's supposed to be the same  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0unless some code create a special context to give it in parameter of course  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so in theory yes you can refactor it all using ExecutionContext which is how most of the components are working  \n14:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the main issue is: how will documentName be resolved if you`r in a multiwiki environment and documentName is a relative?  \n14:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0does it deppend from the context where the call is made?  \n14:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: you can use DocumentReferenceResolver with hint \"current\" for this kind of use case  \n14:45\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, I want to catch both cases: when the documentName si both relative and absolute  \n14:46\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so, in any case, the idea is that doing what I described is safe and recommended, right?  \n14:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0guys, I can't see any link to download XEM/Workspaces on our download page. is this intended ? http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Download I also see that this redirects to enterprise. I'm not sure this is ok  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: the link you gave is for XE  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it also contains links to other projects below)  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in the other downloads section)  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally i don't like too much this download page (I don't find it easy to read - evalica)  \n15:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: DocumentReferenceResolver will work with both relative and absolute reference, that's its job  \n15:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's here so that you don't have to worry and always get an absolute reference  \n15:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I guess XE is our flag product, so that is advertized in the first place.

 \n16:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the latest version is not imported it seems  \n16:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so we don't have 3.4 in the result  \n16:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking why  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why was the page title modified?  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we shouldn't modify it if it exists  \n16:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the name changed actually, it's the reference extension name  \n16:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the description does not change, same for the summary but I though the reference extension name should be seen as the right one in theory  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we need to find a solution for this  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because right now the name is less good than what we had I think  \n16:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if the name is not right we should probably change it in maven  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not necessarily the same rule  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes we can discuss this  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have a new \"Dependencies\" section, cool  \n16:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not new :)  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it link to the extension page too?  \n16:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's just that the dependency was never provided  \n16:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes it does (and did)  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if the page exists)  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I don't understand the website information  \n16:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's the one XR found in the Extension object  \n16:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's the one generated by maven in that case  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we probably shouldn't display it on e.x.o  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the website is supposed to be the page itself  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: can we restrict how many versions we import?  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw you need to remove the first version object ;)  \n16:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not un the script service API but it would be easy to add  \n16:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I think this object is part of the bug with the last version, it's supposed to be removed  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0according to our rule we should only keep the last 2 releases for the version I think  \n16:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not 2 release actually  \n16:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a02 branches  \n16:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but we can decide to import only stable versions  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually why do we need to keep anything more than the last version?  \n16:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0right now there is not much filtering  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other versions are in maven repos  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just for the EM search right?  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(till we support maven indexing)  \n16:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well you don't always are on the lastest XE version and sometime you can't install the last version  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but they're avail in maven repos  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they don't have to be on e.x.o  \n16:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then you have to know the id and the version you want to install it from maven repository right now  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually in theory we don't need any version on e.x.o \u2026 :)  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes because we cannot search in maven repos yet  \n16:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it depends how you see e.x.o  \n16:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if it's just here as a documentation we don't really need to import anything...  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the search was working across XR repos we would get dups  \n17:14\u00a0<CIA-85>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* rd4fee38\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-extension/xwiki-platform-extension-repositories/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-aether/src/main/java/org/xwiki/extension/repository/aether/internal/AetherExtensionRepository.java :\u000f XWIKI-7474: Aether based implementation of resolveVersions does not ...  \n17:14\u00a0<CIA-85>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r6c3d150\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-extension/xwiki-platform-extension-repositories/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-xwiki/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-xwiki-server-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/extension/repository/xwiki/internal/DefaultRepositoryManager.java :\u000f XWIKI-7475: Extension import resolve several times the last version - http://git.io/Pr4wIQ  \n18:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:20\u00a0<tekzilla\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:24\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0is now known as <npm>  \n19:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0restarting xwiki.org  \n19:30\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:46\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:55\u00a0<CIA-85>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r4c6dbda\u000f \u000f/ (3 files in 3 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7476: Sheets need to be able to display the title of the document they are applied to ...  \n21:57\u00a0<CIA-85>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r118a756\u000f \u000f/ (2 files):\u000f XE-1105: Default class sheet does't display correctly the class title ...  \n22:33\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n23:09\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n23:16\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:56\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
