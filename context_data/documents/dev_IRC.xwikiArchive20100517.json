And we probably need to leave time for users who have not migrated to 2.0 syntax yet. I'd say maybe for XWiki 3.0  \nvmassol - (13:01): (XWiki 3.0 is the extension manager for me - we need to define this and agree of course)  \narkub joined #xwiki at 13:43  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 13:45  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 13:55  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 14:00  \nDSpair joined #xwiki at 14:01  \nDSpair - (14:02): Good day all. In XWiki Syntax 2.0, how would I link to an attachment on a different page/space?  \nvmassol - (14:02): hi DSpair  \nvmassol - (14:02): [[label>>attach:Space.Page@filename]]  \nDSpair - (14:03): Good morning Vincent  \nDSpair - (14:03): Ahh, thank you sir!  \nvmassol - (14:04): good point, we need to add this to the syntax page  \ntmortagne - (14:05): DSpair: note that when you don't know how to do something in xwiki/2.0 syntax the WYSIWYG probably know how to do it so you can look at what the WYSIWYG generated in the source  \nvmassol - (14:06): (I'm adding it to the syntax page now)  \nDSpair - (14:08): Hrrmmm . . . Looks like the panels still use 1.0 syntax on my version of XWiki.  \nDSpair - (14:08): And panels don't have a WYSIWYG editor tmortagne.  \ntmortagne - (14:09): DSpair: i mean do that in another test page  \nDSpair - (14:09): tmortagne: Oh, good point.  \ntmortagne - (14:09): i only suggested to look how WYSIWYG do thing when you don't know not to use the WYSIWYG all the time  \ntmortagne - (14:10): btw it seems wrong to me that you don't have WYSIWYG when inline editing a panel  \ntmortagne - (14:10): if the panel is xwiki/2.0 of course  \ntmortagne - (14:11): panel class probably have a wrong configuration for the content field since it's possible to have WYSIWYG for object fields AFAIK  \nDSpair - (14:13): Hmmm . . . Seems like I have all sorts of problems with panels. The panels on my XWiki (1.9.3) are in XWiki 1.0 syntax, but I cannot get the \"attach\" macro to work.  \ntmortagne - (14:14): DSpair: if the atatchement is on the panel it's probably the reason, a panels is executed with the main document as contexte document so if you don't indicate explicitely the panel as document where to find the attachement if will probably not work  \nDSpair - (14:14): Nevermind, I fat fingered.
