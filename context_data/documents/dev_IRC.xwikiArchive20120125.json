I'm sending the Keys.TAB key to an input. On FF9.01 the focus is moved to the next input and the test passes. On FF3.6 the TAB key is sent but it fails to focus the next input because of http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=368 . The second comment is important. If I enabled native events the test passes on FF3.6 also. I'm tempted to leave the test as it is, but it will generate false negatives.   \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if you enable native events, what happens for people on mac?  \n11:24\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0hello vmassol . When would be available for a short call on how we could improve the jira macro by adding the capability to access private jiras. I have an idea but I want to discuss it with you  \n11:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't know :( . They don't state why native events are disabled by default for linux and mac  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0linux too? thought it was only mac  \n11:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0just a sec  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0The immediate solution would be to run the tests from a platform that supports native  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0events - Windows or Linux (it has to be explicitly enabled for Linux, though, by  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0calling FirefoxProfile.setEnableNativeEvents(true)).  \n11:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0// For now, only enable native events on Windows  \n11:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0public static final boolean DEFAULT\\_ENABLE\\_NATIVE\\_EVENTS = Platform.getCurrent().is(WINDOWS);  \n11:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0from FirefoxDriver  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by default mflorea I think  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you can enable them  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FirefoxProfile.setEnableNativeEvents  \n11:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but I don't know the consequences  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ideally it would be just ignored on platforms that don't support them  \n11:26\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0if they are supported, why aren't they enabled by default  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good question  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok different track  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do we need tab?  \n11:26\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there must be a reason why they are disabled by default on linux and mac  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't we write the test differently?  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(mflorea: I think the reason is that it wasn't considered working well enough yet)  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but I think they've been enabled recently on some platform - need to check RN)  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm probably confusing with \"\\* Native events enabled for Firefox 9\")  \n11:28\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0not really. I have an input that filters typed characters, i.e. it accepts only digits (0-9) and special keys like Left/Right arrow and Tab. At some point the Tab key was not included in the list of accepted keys, and you couldn't move the focus to then next input. This test verifies that you can navigate with Tab  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway the best bet IMO  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it to wrtie the test differnetly  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's not write a test for TAB FTM then  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can add a comment with a link to this issue with a todo when the issue is fixed  \n11:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-4230  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this means that this is a test that sburjan will have to do manually for now :)  \n11:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but the test passes on FF9 :(  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we just run this test on some platform  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and some FF version  \n11:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, that would be best  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that might be useful to add to our framework  \n11:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but how do we specify that a rest should be run only in a specific browser  \n11:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/rest/test?  \n11:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n11:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n11:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0let me check something  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's probably an api in selenium to get the platform  \n11:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: note that we'll have to make tests work on Windows too, with different browsers. We'll have to discuss if we can make a test work on multiple browsers ..
