Also if I have multiples color theme that I want to use the same logo, I should be able to reuse it  \narkub joined #xwiki at 10:58  \nglerouge - (10:58): right, I didn't think about the different logo per space use case, I didn't even know it was implemented  \nglerouge - (10:59): now you can have a different color theme per space ?  \nevalica - (10:59): :) don't think is yet implementd :P  \nevalica - (11:00): but on incubator there was a version - where you could have colortheme per user  \nglerouge - (11:00): ok  \nglerouge - (11:00): well, I still think we could make the logo uplaod process a bit better - but you're the UI guru, it's your call ;)  \nannacondan left at 11:03 (Quit: annacondan  \nvmassol left at 11:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 11:09  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 11:12  \ngvallarelli left at 11:21 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \ngvallarelli joined #xwiki at 11:22  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 11:29  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 11:58  \njvdrean left at 12:10 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu left at 12:13 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 12:14  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 12:43  \nflorinciu left at 13:17 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 13:27  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 13:33  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 13:33  \nCiprian joined #xwiki at 13:38  \nsilviar - (13:41): Hi!
