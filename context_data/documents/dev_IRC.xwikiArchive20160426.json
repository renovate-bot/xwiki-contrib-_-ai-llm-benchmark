I feel like I'm cutting boubou and martinus talk, it's a bit chaotic, am I right ?  \n14:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0xwiki\\_finstern: \u00a0if they are in different classes they could as separate properties, usually  \n14:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0chat is chaotic, naturally :)  \n14:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have not much time, unfortunately have to leave in a few minutes (meeting, hooray)  \n14:59\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I feel the pain  \n14:59\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I have those too :-(  \n14:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, the other way is to look at the XWiki.LiveTableResults page and try to write a simplified version of that and use this.  \n15:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0unfortunately XWiki.LiveTableResults has grown quite complex over the time, supports lots of features ... thus hard to understand  \n15:00\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so to be fast and clear : each class have a common property named Typecheck and I intended to use it to show all the documents that have this property in their class  \n15:01\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0as I believe this is how the \"extraParams\" : \"&yourProperty\\_class=yourSpace.yourClass\" work  \n15:02\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0a sample code would greatly help understanding how this option work :-S  \n15:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, but it only shows docs for one class and property  \n15:02\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_ should I puit the full dn case sensitive ?  \n15:03\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0boubou, it is not case sensitive  \n15:03\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I don't understand ClemensR, what's the point of the option if it show only docs for one class ? since livetable already do this in standard ?  \n15:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0xwiki\\_finstern: no, I mean it works for one combination of class and property, not one property in two different classes (I think)  \n15:04\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so you mean that I would need to add a specific property for each class I want to show ?  \n15:04\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0mmmh  \n15:05\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I will try that and see if it work, thank for the idea  \n15:06\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0(my Idea was that I would have the same property in each class, and put a different value for this property in each class)  \n15:07\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok, good luck for your meeting ClemensR, thank for the help  \n15:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess with a custom HQL-Query that might be workeable, the differne clases, same property query, but not witht eh standard livetable, sorry  \n15:08\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0no pb  \n15:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and yep, gotta run, thanls for unterstanding  \n15:08\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0well .. yes a problem, but it's mine to deal with ^^  \n15:08\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0good afternoon  \n15:08\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0boubou, I should leave but I'm pretty sure we found the issue  \n15:09\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0the issue is c= ?

Its what I see too  \n17:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I mostly use Debian but it's not really like I tried something else :)  \n17:28\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0your distribution choice is mostly related to your company choices I think, if you are in a company setup  \n17:28\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0mine work on redhat, I don't have the choice :D  \n17:29\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0in the end it's still a linux core with variations, xwiki should work the same  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I can tell you is that xwiki.org and XWiki SAS mostly use Debian so it's probably the system on which XWiki is tested the most, at least the system in which it's tested early  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0tmortagne, do you know who can help me with the livetable extraParams options ?  \n17:31\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I'm still trying to make the custom Xproperty option working but I'm left with just this information :  \n17:31\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0This option can also be used to view properties of classes other than the one declared in className (\"extraParams\" : \"&yourProperty\\_class=yourSpace.yourClass\" - sorting and filtering available from version 6.2.1.)  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK extraParams is actually parameters sent to the JSON service URL  \n17:32\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0and I admit I havn't managed to get it work as intended for now  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really related to objects  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the standard JSON service support a few option that are listed and the if you provide a custom one that's where you can put more options  \n17:33\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0an example would really help but I havn't found any related to this specific option  \n17:33\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0an example of supported parameter is  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"extraParams\" : \"&space=${doc.space}\"  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to get document only part of passed space  \n17:34\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0yes this one I managed to get it work  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but there is not much parameters supported by default and they are all listed in http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Livetable+Macro#HParameter24options  \n17:34\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:34\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0it's specifically the \"extraParams\" : \"&yourProperty=yourValue\" that I can't make work  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } \u00a0space, parent, orphaned, location  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this one is URL parameters only  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it won't have any effect with the standard service  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you want to use that you need to implement and declare a different service generating JSON for the livetable  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's indeed not very clear in extraParams documentation  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Livetable+Macro#HCustomJSON  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm wait  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a bit both actually it seems  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like it can also have effect on the column of the table  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't think I ever used that  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really sure everything listed in extraParams is accurate  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0try the mailing list maybe  \n17:38\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I only try to show in the livetable documents done with differents class, from the same space, instead of one class only  \n17:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's usually seen by more people  \n17:38\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok  \n17:39\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I will try to check here, thank you tmortagne for trying to help  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you're welcome  \n17:40\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0maybe it should be an idea of improvement for the Livetable to give the option to add multiple class for the \"className\" option  \n17:41\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I think the case where we have multiple class must be something happening more than once, so the option may be usefull  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n17:54\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:56\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0tmortagne yes, in our compagny, we use OL7...  \n17:56\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0Its a compagny choiice  \n17:57\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0what do you advice me for the next xwiki version ?
