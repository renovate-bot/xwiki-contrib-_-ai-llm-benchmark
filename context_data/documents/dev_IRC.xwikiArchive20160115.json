I don't necesseraly want to force in apache, if xwiki can generate its links as https. I've ticket the box for one of our wiki but If I then go to my profile, I only get regular http links (xwiki 6.4.4). Is a restart needed ?  \n11:17\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0note that this is the main wiki  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no, no restart needed but maybe you have xwiki.cfg \"xwiki.home\" property set to an http URL ?  \n11:18\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0well it could be, let me check  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you are on the same wiki XWiki generate relative link  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's just your browser resolving them for you but if you look in the html you won't see http  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0complete link are only generated when you link to a different wiki  \n11:19\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ok, I have xwiki.home=http://xxx  \n11:19\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0that's it  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"SSL\" option does not force absolute link, it just indicate that when you need absolute link i should be https  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/i should/it should/  \n11:23\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:33\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, yes, and it seems (as told by our webmaster) that when using a macro of the main wiki from a https child wiki (using ,$xwiki.ssx.use(\"xwiki:XWiki.YoutubeMacro\") for ex ) \u00a0there is an absolute link generated with http : is it because of xwiki.home or the SSL option ?  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes xwiki.home have priority I think  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you need to restart after changing xwiki.cfg  \n11:35\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, yes, thanks. I think I get it :)  \n11:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you're welcome  \n11:35\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0vmassol, with my personal machine it works, but I have to use the wiki with a stupid secured machine on a secured network with no internet connection  \n11:35\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0vmassol, so I can't test with the online sandbox  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it works on your machine then it's not a browser plugin issue  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(provided you use the same browser in your tests)  \n11:36\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0no, on my own machine i use firefox on ubuntu :P \u00a0and the secured machine is some windows 7 with IE 10........  \n11:37\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0I guess there are not plugins at all, but IE10 is crap  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still IE10 shouldn't change the content of a text area...  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you could explain to us exactly what you're doing  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0step by step I mean  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds a lot like some listener on your remove wiki  \n11:44\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:46\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:47\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0maybe some extension...  \n11:48\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/remove/remote/  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ping  \n12:23\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:59\u00a0<RodrigoXwiki>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:00\u00a0<RodrigoXwiki>\u00a0Hello  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi  \n13:42\u00a0<RodrigoXwiki>\u00a0I'm confused about something.. Can I still use spaces in 7.4? I actually could use the concept.  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0RodrigoXwiki: yes spaces are still there in the model  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should read this:  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/preview/Features/ContentOrganization  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then if you still have questions then report them here as we'll need to improve that doc! :)  \n13:54\u00a0<RodrigoXwiki>\u00a0I did read it. I guess my problem is how it translates to the interface now, there's many options And I'm still exploring that. But Seems that every non-terminal page is actually a space, which kinda defeats the purpose of space as a more top level context container. Foswiki also had the webs concept for this.  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"how it translates to the interface now, there's many options\". WDYM?  \n13:55\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's only 1 option now which is to create a page  \n13:55\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(from the UI POV)  \n13:55\u00a0<RodrigoXwiki>\u00a0Not creation, navigation.  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok WDYM by several nav options?  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(trying to understand the complexity to see if we can do something about it)  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'll get to your other points once we finish with this one. I'm taking them one by one ;))  \n13:57\u00a0<RodrigoXwiki>\u00a0Of course. I can't access the xwiki instance now, let's resume this when I can actually elaborate while looking at it.  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the UI is supposed to be consistent and should only show pages  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can navigate from several ways of course but I see this as a good thing. To give a few examples:  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- ctrl + g  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- direct URL  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- breacrumb  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- tree view in the breadcrumb  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- Index page  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- links inside page contnet  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- search  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that what you meant?  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I gave you a wrong url above, the correct one is http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/ContentOrganization  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(my browsers keeps autocompletion with preview action ;))  \n14:04\u00a0<RodrigoXwiki>\u00a0I have to leave for lunch. I'll ping here afterwards and expose better. Tks again.  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok bon appetit  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm really interested to continue the conversation  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I'd like to make it as simple as possible to understand and I know we have some quirks after introducing Nested Pages  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/we have/we probably have  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I need to understand the issue when someone fresh tries to graps it ;)  \n14:07\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: pong  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: hmm now need to remember what I wanted to ask you\u2026 :)  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes\u2026  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/developer-guide.html#Velocity\\_Configuration\\_Keys\\_and\\_Values  \n14:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0about the \"navigation: where are the spaces\": personally I vaguely guess the issue is that people get used to have spaces a simple, basic, top-level structures ... so a widget showing only \"top level spaces\" might help ... but that is just a vague guess of mine  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it mentions \"This property sets the 'Uberspector', the introspection package that handles all introspection strategies for Velocity. You can specify a comma-separated list of Uberspector classes, in which case all Uberspectors are chained. \"  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess this is something you contributed back  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my question is why are we still using our own chaining code instead of velocity's now?  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(any reason or just lack of time migrating to it?)  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: sure but OTOH it would totally confuse everyone else  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since you'd need to explain the concept of spaces and how it's different from nested pages)  \n14:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yeah, I know, maybe name it \"top level pages\" ?  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we do need though  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and guillaumeD is working on it)  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is a migration guide  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have that already :)  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's even on the dashboard home page  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think RodrigoXwiki understood correctly actually  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since he said \"But Seems that every non-terminal page is actually a space, which kinda defeats the purpose of space as a more top level context container\"  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is exactly why we deprecated the concept of space in the UI because it's replaced by a more generic concept of nested pages  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which supports several levels and not just one)  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however the underlying model still has spaces so Nested Pages are implemented with Nested Spaces under the hood  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is the tricky part that we'll have till we remove spaces from the model  \n14:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, then my guess is just wrong :)  \n14:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: No reason, just that we didn't get around to actually update our code after the upgrade  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see what RodrigoXwiki says  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok thanks  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so something that we should do  \n14:18\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0We should check if there's something we have in our class that's not part of the official codebase, although I doubt there is  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I asked a question to you in a jira issue  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding filtering of dates in livetbales  \n14:18\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I think they didn't accept the LinkingUberspector, which we don't use anyway  \n14:18\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Didn't see that  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah didn't know we don't use it, ok  \n14:19\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't read jira and commits notifications anymore...  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I saw that you assigned yourself to a jira issue regarding this  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I was hoping that you were porting the work you did on phenotips to the platform :)  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I remember seeing a nice date filter there on phenotips)  \n14:19\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, that's the plan  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok very cool then  \n14:19\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I want to reduce the amount of patches that we have  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool for the xwiki project  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any timeframe? :)  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this issue has been recently asked a lot)  \n14:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Not really...  \n14:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Bogged down with work  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's nice (hoping you enjoy it :))  \n14:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:35\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0has quit  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I see LinkingUberspector in velocity 1.7  \n14:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Good  \n14:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So there's nothing else to do but to deprecate our classes  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in case someone has created a custom uberspector right?  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(a custom chained uberspector based on our class that is)  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can deprecate and move them to legacy  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I think there might be bug in your impl  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0In AbstractChainableUberspector.getMethod(\u2026) for example you have: return (this.inner != null) ? this.inner.getMethod(obj, methodName, args, i) : null;  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if you impl a chained uberspector and you put it as the frist uberspector in the chain, it'll return null always  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead it should probably call super.getMethod() instead  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to call the impl from UberspectImpl  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this.inner is the following Uberspect in the chain so not sue what you mean  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/sue/sure/  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(\"inner\" is quite a bad name BTW)  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I put a single uberspector in the chain it fails  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this is my test case)  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so you don't mean first you mean alone  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reason it works for MethodArgumentUberspectorTest is because it uses the full default list  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this.defaultProperties.setProperty(\"runtime.introspector.uberspect.chainClasses\", StringUtils.join(  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0inner is the previous one for me  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wrap(Uberspect inner)  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so a chaining uberspector wraps another one  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed looks like ChainingUberspector initialize the chain in the wrong order  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now indeed it should probably call super, thing is since implementing getMethod is the main job of the uberspector this method is rarely executed  \n15:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha no they call super indeed  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what you mean, all our uberspectors call super.getMethod  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie AbstractChainableUberspector.getMethod()  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0talking about DeprecatedCheckUberspector and MethodArgumentsUberspector  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and my ExceptionCatchingUberspector now  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0never really been an issue for for us since we always had SecureUberspector as first element which is not a chainable uberspector (and it will probably be like this for a long time I guess)  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but indeed probably better fix the abstract  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now we live with this issue since forever  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if someone wanted to configure his wiki without the secure uberspector, he'd have a problem...  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes we could have lots of security holes :D  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so either we keep our implementation and fix it or we use Velocity one (I guess we cannot really expect a release of Velocity anytime soon)  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even with the secure uberspector first my test is fialing debugging  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found my problem it was fun :) https://gist.github.com/vmassol/ec3c407f264091eeb4b3#file-gistfile1-txt-L115-L123  \n16:31\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:00\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n17:15\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0haha\u2026. we currently have #try() executed around all content  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(from contentvars.vm)  \n17:36\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0hello again (ex-RodrigoXwiki here)  \n17:37\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0strange issue I'm facing..

But I agree there could be use cases I don't see now that would require this  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0creating jira issue  \n18:04\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0pardon the intromission, but couldn't the option be presented in the UI when deleting?  \n18:06\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0and any workaround to delete that WebPreferences?  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it is presented :)  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just didn't selecet iut  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*select  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've now created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13008  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not in 7.4 I think  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the delete children checkbox has been there for a long time  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha yes it's in 7.4 too  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was not sure since I was looking at 8.0  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0RodrigoPT76: its not easy to delete it indeed since it's an admin pag  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it redirects to the admin action  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yes you do have an option RodrigoPT76 just did not understood that WebPreferences was a children page probably  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you need to force the \"delete\" action by changing it in the url  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so go to that WebPreferences page  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and replace \"admin\" by \"delete\"  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the URL  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bb  \n18:25\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:33\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n18:57\u00a0<RodrigoPT76>\u00a0vmassol: oops, probably didn't seleted true.
