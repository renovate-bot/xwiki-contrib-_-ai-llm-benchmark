In order to check this you edit XWiki.XWikiPreferences with the class editor and see if they are present  \nmflorea - (15:20): most probably you don't have them, so you just add them. both are string properties.  \nmflorea - (15:21): xiuu: let me know if you managed to add these two properties to XWiki.XWikiPreferences  \nxiuu - (15:26): got it :D  \nxiuu - (15:26): mflorea:  \nmflorea - (15:27): evalica: WYSIWYG events are listed here http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/WysiwygEditorModule#HCustomevents Maybe you should just add a link on DevGuide.JavaScriptAPI  \nevalica - (15:27): super - thanks :)  \nevalica - (15:28): the created was the one I found :)  \nmflorea - (15:28): xiuu: you managed to put the color picker on the tool bar or just to add the prop to XWiki.XWikiPreferences?  \nxiuu - (15:28): add the prop to the prefs  \nmflorea - (15:28): great  \nmflorea - (15:28): no you have to edit XWiki.XWikiPreferences with the object editor  \nmflorea - (15:29): and set their value  \nxiuu - (15:29): Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences: DefaultSkin.  \nxiuu - (15:29): this one?  \nmflorea - (15:29): yep  \nmflorea - (15:29): expand it  \nmflorea - (15:30): and look at the end  \nxiuu - (15:31): found the wysiwyg fields. now lets say i want to add a colorpicker and a fontpicker. 'color' and 'font'  \nxiuu - (15:31): do i have to write it to both  \nxiuu - (15:31): fields  \nmflorea - (15:32): you have to fill both fields, but with different values.

As a consequence, customizing the colors, font names and font sizes is a but harder.
