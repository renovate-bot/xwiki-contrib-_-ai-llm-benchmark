There are quite some sources but otherwise not very many modified poms...  \nvmassol - (10:07): one small comment I have is that you have added lots of annotation deps to the web/standard pom  \nlucaa - (10:07): yes, I know  \nvmassol - (10:07): yes I'm talking generally about the code, not the integration  \nvmassol - (10:07): another strategy would be to have a special module in annotations/  \nlucaa - (10:08): that pulls all the annotation module, right?  \nvmassol - (10:08): that either generates a single jar and thus have all the deps specified  \nlucaa - (10:08): is that an acceptable strategy?  \nvmassol - (10:08): or is just a pom aggregator (but I think this is only in maven 3.0)  \nlucaa - (10:08): ok  \nvmassol - (10:10): it's not a big deal  \nvmassol - (10:10): and it can wait a bit till we agree on a general strategy, we have the same need for rendering I think  \nlucaa - (10:10): ok  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:13  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:13  \njvdrean left at 10:17 (Client Quit  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:18  \nglerouge joined #xwiki at 10:23  \njvdrean left at 10:29 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:29  \nmflorea left at 10:34 (Quit: Leaving.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 10:39  \nlucaa - (10:48): vmassol: we add since tags to all classes or only to non-internal?  \nvmassol - (10:49): minimum is to all user-public classes indeed  \nvmassol - (10:49): personally I use it for all but you can do the minimum  \nlucaa - (10:49): ok, I'll add to all then  \nlucaa - (10:49): there seem to be a few non-expanded ids too which I'd better spot  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): I have a script for this  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): find -name \\*.java -execdir ~/pssvnid.sh {} \\;  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): Where pssvnid.sh contains:  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): if [[ -z `svn pg svn:keywords $1` ]]  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): then  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): \u00a0svn ps svn:keywords Id $1  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): fi  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): if [[ -z `svn pg svn:eol-style $1` ]]  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): then  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): \u00a0svn ps svn:eol-style native $1  \nlucaa - (10:52): sdumitriu: of course :)  \nsdumitriu - (10:52): fi  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 10:54  \njvelociter - (10:55): hi guys  \nvmassol - (10:56): hi jvelociter  \nlucaa - (10:56): hi jvelociter  \njvelociter - (10:56): Q about the configuration module / xwiki.properties. Do we have the possibility of adding extra properties from a project pom.xml (for example a project with a web/ module that depends on web/standard)  \nvmassol - (10:57): not sure what you mean  \nvmassol - (10:57): especially since there should be no config value by default  \nvmassol - (10:58): (at least so far we've succeeded in doing that)  \njvelociter - (10:58): yes but what if I want to override default values in a project for example ?  \nvmassol - (10:58): so this is in a custom project not in platform right?  \njvelociter - (10:58): i.e. when generating the web/ module of my project I want a xwiki.properties with different defaults  \njvelociter - (10:58): yes  \nvmassol - (10:59): you can replace the file altogether of course  \njvelociter - (10:59): yes but that's not very stable in the long run  \nvmassol - (10:59): right  \njvelociter - (11:00): I could have a new configuration source  \njvelociter - (11:00): myproject.properties  \nvmassol - (11:00): actually  \njvelociter - (11:00): that has a higher priority than xwiki.properties  \njvelociter - (11:00): and override here  \nvmassol - (11:01): I was thinking about something slightly different over the weekend  \nvmassol - (11:01): we haven't used the commons configuration notion of composite sources yet  \ntmortagne - (11:01): jvelociter: should not be too hard to add value to any file with maven  \njvelociter - (11:01): tmortagne: you append content  \njvelociter - (11:01): yes I could look into that too  \nvmassol - (11:02): http://commons.apache.org/configuration/userguide/howto\\_configurationbuilder.html#Using\\_DefaultConfigurationBuilder  \nvmassol - (11:02): commons config has the ability to specify a file that describes the config files location  \nvmassol - (11:02): (and allow chaining too btw)  \njvelociter - (11:03): cool  \nvmassol - (11:03): I'm still unsure if we want to use that and how we'd use it though  \nlucaa - (11:04): sdumitriu: it seems we have different shells, I have quite some errors...  \ngmpff - (11:04): hi  \nvmassol - (11:04): jvelociter: btw you can use an Ant task to perform replaces too, there are good replace tasks in Ant  \njvelociter - (11:04): I will look into the maven shade plugin for now to generate the proper xwiki.properties, but I keep that in mind  \nvmassol - (11:04): shade?  \nvmassol - (11:04): shade is to generate an uberjar  \njvelociter - (11:06): it looks like you can do file merging with it  \nsdumitriu - (11:06): lucaa: Don't forget to close the fi at the end  \nsdumitriu - (11:06): I forgot to paste it  \nlucaa - (11:06): sdumitriu: I didn't  \nvmassol - (11:06): jvelociter: maybe but it's not its goal  \njvelociter - (11:06): ah ok I misread. that's not what I'm looking for  \njvelociter - (11:06): yes  \ngmpff - (11:06): I'm writing an integration layer on XWiki Enterprise so that we can interact with XWiki from other backend systems (system-to-system interaction). However, I want to expose my own interface and write the logic layer in Python (so using the XWiki REST API directly from the other backend system won't work). So far, my options seem to be to either write a new Struts action that invokes Python scripts on disk or to write the integration layer entirely separately  \ngmpff - (11:06): in Python and access XWiki using the REST API. REST API solution is more decoupled, which is good, but I might run into limitations on this API. Or was the REST API created exactly with this use case in mind ? Suggestions ?  \njvelociter - (11:06): ok, I'll search for something else maven or ant  \ntmortagne - (11:07): jvelociter: should be possible with assembly plugin too i think  \nlucaa - (11:07): sdumitriu: I get this kind of things:  \nlucaa - (11:07): /home/lucaa/pssvnid.sh: 4: [[: not found  \nvmassol - (11:08): gmpff: does it mean you'd be interested in generating new REST APIs from within a wiki page?  \nvmassol - (11:08): (not sure I understand fully what you want to do)  \ngmpff - (11:09): vmassol: I want to write the code outside of wiki pages.  \nvmassol - (11:09): lucaa: have you specified the shell as the first line of your script?  \nlucaa - (11:09): no I havent  \nbblfish left at 11:09 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \ngmpff - (11:09): vmassol: but the code needs to interact with the wiki content.  \nvmassol - (11:09): gmpff: I don't understand  \nlucaa - (11:09): but if at sdumitriu works without then it means we have different shells...  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 11:09  \nvmassol - (11:09): well that's using the XWiki REST API from the client side  \nvmassol - (11:10): what's the pb with that?  \ngmpff - (11:10): vmassol: I want to define my own API to the client apps. Isolate from a specific CMS.  \nvmassol - (11:10): yes but what's the realtionship with xwiki?  \ngmpff - (11:10): vmassol: it's the source of the data.  \nvmassol - (11:10): yes but you can get the data using REST for that  \ngmpff - (11:10): vmassol: e.g. I want to render an index of all pages in a space as an XML document with a schema that I define.  \nvmassol - (11:10): still not understanding the pb :)  \ngmpff - (11:11): vmassol: my own schema.  \nvmassol - (11:11): ok so you get the data from xwiki using REST API and then you expose it in your client  \nvmassol - (11:11): ?  \ngmpff - (11:11): That would work, yes.  \ngmpff - (11:12): However, what if I tomorrow want to create a space from that same client script ? Seems that the REST API can't do that.  \nsdumitriu - (11:12): Spaces don't exist  \nsdumitriu - (11:12): You can't create a space  \nvmassol - (11:12): gmpff: you can  \ngmpff - (11:12): So my question is: is the REST API general purpose enough or is it mainly for extracting content \u00a0?  \nvmassol - (11:12): you create a MySpace.WebHome document  \nsdumitriu - (11:12): Just create a document with that space  \nvmassol - (11:12): gmpff: it's both for readind AND writing  \ngmpff - (11:13): So there should be no real benefit (apart from maybe reduced latency) in going for the Struts action option ?  \nvmassol - (11:13): (spaces are indeed implicit, see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/Spaces )  \nvmassol - (11:13): gmpff: right, no real benefit (not even sure what it would mean)  \ngmpff - (11:14): Thanks. Sorry for not knowing this yet. Many of the xwiki subtleties still elude me.  \nvmassol - (11:14): no pb!  \ngmpff - (11:14): vmassol: what what would mean ?  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 11:14  \nvmassol - (11:14): not sure why you'd want to write a struts action  \nvmassol - (11:14): if you wanted to extend the XWIki REST API you'd write a component  \nvmassol - (11:15): (a REST resource component)  \ngmpff - (11:15): So that I can execute Python code on disk that interacts with the xwiki Java API.  \ngmpff - (11:15): hmmmm ..... that makes more sense.  \ngmpff - (11:15): So instead of creating another integration point (i.e. Python scripts on disk), I just extend the existing REST API one.  \nvmassol - (11:15): in some future you'll be able to extend the XWIKi REST API directly from within xwiki pages  \nvmassol - (11:15): in any scripting language of your choice :)  \nsdumitriu - (11:15): gmpff: You could write a Jython script inside the wiki, it would be more simple  \nvmassol - (11:16): sdumitriu: not sure you can do that right now...  \nsdumitriu - (11:16): vmassol and tmortagne, there's a problem with section editing  \ngmpff - (11:16): sdumitriu: been there done that, but it's difficult to debug and reuse code.  \ntmortagne - (11:17): sdumitriu: what is the issue ?  \ngmpff - (11:17): vmassol: does \u00a0the code inside \u00a0{{python}} not execute in Jython ? What am I \u00a0missing ?  \nvmassol - (11:17): sdumitriu: actually I'm sure you cannot right now since the main REST componetn don't do dynamic lookups  \nsdumitriu - (11:17): http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Sandbox/ft  \nvmassol - (11:17): gmpff: I'm talking about extending the XWiki REST API from within wiki pages  \ngmpff - (11:17): vmassol: ok, sorry.  \nsdumitriu - (11:17): There are two {{html}}<h2> and one wiki ==  \nsdumitriu - (11:18): There should not be section editing for the first two  \nsdumitriu - (11:18): Normally headers generated inside macros have a class=\"wikigeneratedheader\" or something like that  \nsdumitriu - (11:18): But not inside {{html}}  \nvmassol - (11:18): right....  \nvmassol - (11:19): so we'd need the opposite strategy? :)  \nvmassol - (11:19): (ie have a class for \"normal\" headers)  \nsdumitriu - (11:19): That would solve it, but I don't like it  \nsdumitriu - (11:19): That's an unneeded class  \nsdumitriu - (11:19): We should not mark \"normal\" stuff  \nvmassol - (11:20): yes, agreed  \ntmortagne - (11:20): maybe it means we need to put back macro marker even in view  \nsdumitriu - (11:22): The solution I'd like is to do a regexp at the end of the html macro processing, to introduce the wikigenerated class  \nsdumitriu - (11:22): WDYT?  \ntmortagne - (11:22): no need for a regexp  \nsdumitriu - (11:22): Why?  \ntmortagne - (11:22): we can do the same thing in the html macro xhtml renderer  \nsdumitriu - (11:23): Even with clean=false?  \ntmortagne - (11:23): ha no  \ntmortagne - (11:23): did not seen it was real html header  \ntmortagne - (11:23): regexp is pretty dangerous  \nvmassol - (11:23): I don't like regexes either  \nsdumitriu - (11:23): Yes, it's HTML header, not wiki header inside {{html}}  \nsdumitriu - (11:24): Well, the alternative is SAX or DOM  \ntmortagne - (11:24): and modifying html provided by the user is not right anyway  \nvmassol - (11:24): view marker is a solution  \ntmortagne - (11:24): we do whatever we want with html we generate but that's not the same thing with html content  \nvmassol - (11:24): so that the section js stuff ignores what's inside that makrer  \nsdumitriu - (11:25): The goal was to elliminate the JS  \nvmassol - (11:25): sdumitriu: I don't remember what was the solution regarding this js btw  \nsdumitriu - (11:25): I have it working with regexps  \nsdumitriu - (11:25): Extra processing in contentview, after extracting the title  \nlucaa - (11:31): vmassol: done with the since tags. Any other observations? Could I consider the integration well done now and close the associated issues?  \nvmassol - (11:31): lucaa: no idea, you can always close if you think it's done  \nvmassol - (11:31): I'm now rebuilding to test it  \ntmortagne - (11:32): another idea is to use a special xhtml renderer to render the final XDOM, one that put the proper css where it's needed  \nsdumitriu - (11:32): Nice logo from Sorana Secu, too bad it screams Confluence from a mile  \nsdumitriu - (11:33): tmortagne: Why \"special\"?  \ntmortagne - (11:33): it makes the whole thing better for perf, no need to reparse the html content after the document is rendered  \ntmortagne - (11:33): sdumitriu: because it doe snot make sense to put section edition css at generic rendering module level  \nsdumitriu - (11:33): Well, actually the perfect solution would be to not need the {{html}} macro  \nvmassol - (11:34): sdumitriu: I don't see the new logo  \nsdumitriu - (11:34): It's not in the page, it's in attachments  \nvmassol - (11:35): ok it's there now thanks to Raluca  \ntmortagne - (11:39): I'm convinced that the better is to render the document using a \"viewxhtml/1.0\" in the templates, we can generate the proper thing directly with all needed informations and don't need to have any crappy marker to reparse  \ntmortagne - (11:39): sdumitriu: is ther an issue for section edition issue ?  \ntmortagne - (11:39): jira issue  \nsdumitriu - (11:39): No  \ntmortagne - (11:40): creating one then  \nanamarias - (11:40): hi. On user log-on or log-in I want to call a JS function, is there a way to create an event listener on the logout/login?  \nsdumitriu - (11:40): tmortagne: Initially I wanted to insert section links using a transformation  \nsdumitriu - (11:40): anamarias: Not with Javascript  \ntmortagne - (11:40): sdumitriu: it's not transformation, it's a lot better at renderer level IMO  \nanamarias - (11:42): sdumitriu: then how can I change the content of a page on user log-out ?
