 \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:18): the recent modifications on the wiki  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:19): well  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:19): I was thinking about a tabbed interface  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:19): you need to put yourself in the widget user's shoes  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:20): I understand :)  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:20): you're working on a wiki, maybe from time to time, maybe every day  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:20): what do you need to know about it  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:20): you might want info about pages you edited where people left comments  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:20): well, I think I can have a tab with General informations  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:20): and a tab with more specific to me information  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:20): pages you edited that were edited again by someone else since  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:21): I was thinking about a tabbed interface  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:21): which widget would you create first by the way ? Firefox ewtension? Windows tray? iGoogle? AIR application? something else ?  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:22): I'm not decided, I'll go for the iGoogle widget  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:22): I have experience with Firefox extensions  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:22): extending FoXWiki (our FF extension) could be nice as well  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:23): but I think the Firefox extension would be a little different  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:23): than the widget  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:23): I think there is plenty of time in the summer to also extend FoXWiki  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:23): and to make it really cool  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:24): ok  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:25): my take would be that extending FoXWiki is maybe more interesting for XWiki than the iGoogle gadge, but if you can make proposal for both and think you could work on both it's great  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:25): yes, I think so :)  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:26): I have tested FoXWiki  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:26): but I would do something like... having a whole toolbar as the XWiki extension  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:27): or a sidebar  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:27): with lot's of features :)  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:29): do you think that the Firefox extension should have basically the same features as the widget?  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:29): yep  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:29): well, at least the notification part  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:30): well, right now FoXWiki just let's u do some actions faster  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:30): or am I missing something?  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:30): nope you're right  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:30): that + the WebDAV edition part  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:31): letting you define which application to use when editing a document located on the XWiki server through WebDAV  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:31): okay  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:32): well, do you think a sidebar would be the best for FoXWiki?  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:32): twitterfox notifications are light and effective  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:33): let me see  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:33): a sidebar / toolbar might be too heavy  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:33): yes, you're right  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:33): and it looks very much like a widget  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:34): meaning we can use the approximately the same UI   \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:35): yep  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:35): cool :)  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:35): that's good news  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:36): you'd need to change the color though ;)  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:36): not my favorite either ;)  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:36): another question  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:37): do we include a search form in the widget?  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:37): that's a good question  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:37): somethin you need to ask youself is how many wikis your widge will support -> 1? many?  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:38): hmmm  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:38): for instance I have an account on xwiki.org, another on myxwiki.org  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:38): yes  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:38): i understand  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:38): I might want to follow both wikis  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:39): well, i guess it's common sense to support many wikis  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:39): :(  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:39): it's also harder  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:39): exactly  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:39): both in the interface and the architecture  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:39): it complicates my life :)  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:40): and we didn't even talk about virtual wikis yet ;)  \nancutagheorghe - (25/03/2009 16:40): heey , do you have any idea if sdumitriu will be online today?  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:40): virtual wikis? what's that?  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:40): XWiki Enterprise Manager allows you to manage a farm of wikis  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:40): ancutagheorghe, maybe marta\\_ can answer  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:41): you've got a master wiki and wikis created from that instance  \nancutagheorghe - (25/03/2009 16:41): ok, thank you :)  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:41): so you could have notifications from 5 different wikis that you all access wit hthe same user account  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:41): I see...  \nmarta\\_ - (25/03/2009 16:43): hi ancutagheorghe, i'll ping him, but he might not be available today, he's busy with some very urgent coding  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:44): don't know, I'm having problems with a single wiki :)  \nancutagheorghe - (25/03/2009 16:44): oh don't then  \nmarta\\_ - (25/03/2009 16:44): ancutagheorghe: we got your proposal on the mailing list  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:44): :)  \nancutagheorghe - (25/03/2009 16:44): it's nothing that can't wait until tomorrow  \nmarta\\_ - (25/03/2009 16:44): sounds good  \nancutagheorghe - (25/03/2009 16:44): great   \nancutagheorghe - (25/03/2009 16:44): thank you  \nmarta\\_ - (25/03/2009 16:45): you'll get an answer on the list later today  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:45): alexmaru: think about 1 wiki first, then see how it would behave with multiple wikis  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:45): yes  \nancutagheorghe - (25/03/2009 16:45): ok, thank you again ! :)  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:46): we also need a preference tab  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:46): in which the user defines the address of the wiki  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:46): a settings menu, yes  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:46): and other stuff  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:46): I think FoXWiki has one for WebDAV already  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:46): yes, a menu :)  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 16:46): you'd need to add a tab there  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:47): okay...  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:47): I'll do some research in the following days  \nalexmaru - (25/03/2009 16:47): u're not available not even on the mail?

Actually, I didn't quite understand if the new application only needs new classes and templates or some types of applications require deeper changes on the platform level?  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 17:08): normally it will require only XClasses + ClassSheets + ClassTemplates  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 17:09): + integration with the mailsender plugin (there's an API for that)  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 17:09): no deep modifications involved as far as I can see  \nttokareva - (25/03/2009 17:10): Part of the description says: \u00a0\"It could also use Google online visualization. \" What is it?  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 17:10): no idea  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 17:10): but it s not really important  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 17:11): the important part is the survey creation part, not the graph representation  \nglerouge - (25/03/2009 17:11): the interface to create a new survey and select which questions to include is the important / hard part  \nttokareva - (25/03/2009 17:13): yes, I understand.
