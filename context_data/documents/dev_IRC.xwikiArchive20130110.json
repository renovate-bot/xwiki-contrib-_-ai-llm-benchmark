Is it today or not? (saw no mail about it)  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good question  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0had forgotten about it  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think someone asked to postpone it  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that person has maybe forgotten to follow through :)  \n10:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0hmm :)  \n10:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I have suggested the 10th of January, and sdumitriu1 and mflorea +1ed  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes the date was good  \n10:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is more in the follow up.. I personally had forgotten  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I should have put it in my agenda when you proposed it but I didn't unfrotunately  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to get back on track but it seems too short notice for today  \n10:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok... so what now? Do we announce it all the same (since people are available - but don`t know what they may have planned for today) or do we vote to postpone?  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we're busy stabilizing 4.x  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we should postpone the next BFD to after 4.5  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0OTOH it may help stabilizing...  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we need to address the blockers first  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BFD doesn't address blockers  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it addresses simple bugs mostly  \n10:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0:)  \n10:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I would have thought that they could be included in BFD, since they are still bugs.  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but the goal of BFD  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to reduce the ratio bugs created vs bugs fixed  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's all  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so closing as won't fix is BFD  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for ex)  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the goal is to close the maximum  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not to close the blockers or hardest ones  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I'm saying  \n10:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so you want to keep blockers out, because of time restrictions and the priority that blockers have over other issues/bugs  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that I'm fine to do a BFD for 4.5 BUT  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only after we've fixed the current blockers I've sent on the list  \n10:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ others that I don't know about (waiting for devs to raise other blokers)  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*blockers (if any)  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we probably also need to release a 4.4.1 quickly  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that'll take some more time  \n10:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m just going to reply to the previous thread to let people know we`re skipping today  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0please find a blocking bug to work on too :)  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would help a lot  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean/tmortagne: would be great if you could provide more details on \"XWIKI-8630 Failed to create wiki component(s) during default XAR import\"  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it looks indeed related to \"XWIKI-8629 Application Panel is empty when installing through XAR Import\"  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it looks like an important problem to fix asap  \n10:35\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0jvdrean: those problems are related, during the import, if the wiki components / UIX are imported before XWiki.Admin or XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup they will failed to be registered against the CM  \n10:35\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0(because respectively programming and admin rights are required)  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: can you comment on the jira issue with what you know as a starter?  \n10:36\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0I thought we did it already, doing it now  \n10:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jvdrean: I think it was another issue on wich we discussed it  \n10:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no sure which one  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: so XWIKI-8629 can be closed as a dup of XWIKI-8630 (or vice-versa)? Can you do that?  \n10:44\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0vmassol: well, each issue will require modifications in different modules  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I thought they were the same problem  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys I'd like to merge the new markdown module today, ok for everyone?  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since the 4.5M1 release is on next Monday)  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys I need some git help...  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the repo I'd like to merge back is https://github.com/glaforge/xwiki-rendering which is a fork of our xwiki rendering repo  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I create the PR, I see 71 commits, but in the commits I see the merges I've done in https://github.com/glaforge/xwiki-rendering to get the latest changes from our xwiki rendering repo  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0obviously we don't need those to be in the PR  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should I just not care about them?  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I'm not expert enough in Git I'm going to merge the PR as is with all the history junk  \n11:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I have a question about the JIRA macro you wrote. It seems that I am unable to add 2 custom columns/2 notes columns. Only the last one is taken into account. Is this by design ? It would be very useful for me to be able to add 2-3 custom columns  \n11:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I've reported the suggestion  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: ok  \n11:39\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: this commmit seems wrong. https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-manager/commit/3d13c846d1289643eed946e73a17fec8ba7e0b08  \n12:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I don`t know about the second part (which might be intended), but the first part looks like an unintended deletion and paste.  \n12:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it's preventing xwiki-manager from building due to the invalid pom http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-manager/5213/console  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: the second part is actually useless since it's already done in the XE war  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but yes I made a syntax mistake  \n12:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so the first part about workspace-api stays, right?  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no the first part is weird, I don't understand how it ended up like this actually  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I never tried this  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I just added some exclusion  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess it's a m2e bug  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fixing it  \n12:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0s/stays/does not get removed/ :)  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes that's it m2e exclusion tool is totaly broken as far as I can see  \n12:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok :)  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the only right thing is the last one  \n12:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:36\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n13:08\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:11\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n13:48\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:48\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n13:50\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:08\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have a stuck XE on agent3  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FYI here's its dump: https://gist.github.com/raw/4502053/e7b51c7c41bb07d93b5ad18bd1b7785b4f7f70e8/gistfile1.txt  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0killing it  \n14:39\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0hello.
