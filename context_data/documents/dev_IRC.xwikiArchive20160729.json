So how to rename a class without loose any data ? cjd tmortagne ?  \n12:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0database migration :(  \n12:33\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0:(  \n12:34\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok..  \n12:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you can mysql it, but just living with the old name is probably a superior idea  \n12:36\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok, or create a snippet which will check each doc with old classename and copy old data to the new class object  \n12:37\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0another question (sorry)  \n12:38\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0cjd: $doc.getxWikiClasses().get(0).name will give me alway the first classname alphabetically ordered or what ?  \n12:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't know how the ordering works  \n12:40\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok :) thanks  \n12:41\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0in edit mode, it seems name order by ASC.. but with a get(index) i'm not sure :D  \n12:41\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0anyway, thnks for your support  \n13:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ol-ow2: class property are explicitely ordered, meaning you can give then the order you want so its not automatically sorted  \n13:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/then/them/  \n13:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for class rename yes, it does not automatically rename the class reference in object (something to improve) but that's something you can fix in related document with some script  \n13:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to be fully clean it copy objects with old class name to objects with new class name, remove the old objects, save the document  \n13:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*it means  \n13:15\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:20\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:21\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n13:22\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:24\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n13:24\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n13:26\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n13:33\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:52\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0thx for these explanation tmortagne  \n13:53\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:22\u00a0<acotiuga1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:12\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:17\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:24\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Hello XWiki experts, is there a preferred strategy to write extensions of the CKEditor? I don\u2019t see this documented and will probably start into fiddling the produced webjars.
