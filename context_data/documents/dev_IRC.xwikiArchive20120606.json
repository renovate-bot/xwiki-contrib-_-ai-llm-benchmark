I wonder if this should not be getPageEndIndex, just as getPagePreviousIndex, getPageNextIndex etc.  \n08:38\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I'll have the respective data types instead of string in Indexer process?  \n08:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Makes sense to me.  \n08:38\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:39\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Why does SearchResult have no method?  \n08:40\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0The searchresult will have the fieldtype of the document..  \n08:41\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0and the get methods for it  \n08:41\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0have to include them.  \n08:42\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0something like this  \n08:42\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0private String id;  \n08:42\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0private float score;  \n08:42\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0private String title;  \n08:43\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0public String getId()  \n08:43\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{  \n08:43\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return this.id;  \n08:43\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}  \n08:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0sounds good  \n08:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0though... fieldtype?? would you copy all of that?  \n08:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I'd just make getters that pull from the solr stored fields.  \n08:48\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0Then I guess I don't need that class  \n08:49\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I''m collecting large dataset from wikipedia and importing it to XWiki  \n08:49\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0for indexing..  \n08:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0You definitely do!@  \n08:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0that's a cool idea for a scalability challenge.  \n08:51\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0planning to use them to come up with IndexerProcess Implementaion  \n08:51\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0yeah..  \n08:51\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Using that class as an abstraction to the documents of solr or lucene is really really useful.  \n08:51\u00a0<polx>\u00a0do you have a hosting for that?  \n08:51\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I didn't get you sorry  \n08:51\u00a0<polx>\u00a0something such as public Object get(fieldName)  \n08:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0or  \n08:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0public Object getValue(fieldName)  \n08:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0public List getValues(fieldName)  \n08:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0is going to allow people to easily pull the values stored in solr and avoid to wait for the xwiki loading. This is a huge performance boost!  \n08:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0also, where would highlighting be coming from?  \n08:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Btw, some search methods (the one with the query?) should support a list of returned fields. Crucial for performance as well.  \n08:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0(e.g. in most cases, you do not want the \"description\" field, and you want to avoid to load it, but for some queries, it actually makes sense)  \n08:56\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0for searchResult class I was thinking of making use of the getters that pull the stored fields from the solrdocument and assign it to the member variables.. (happens in constructor)  \n08:58\u00a0<polx>\u00a0That's an extra potentially useless pull step.  \n08:58\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Solr (and Lucene) has the notion of lazy-loaded fields and this would nullify this feature. Even though people would not indicate the fields they intend to use (maybe because they just want to search through a simple text), they are likely to never pull most of the stored fields.  \n08:58\u00a0<polx>\u00a0The too-many-stored fields that are read always is the biggest issue of the Lucene plugin of xwiki.  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n09:05\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0Yeah I'll keep that in mind..  \n09:05\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I have doubt in Index process  \n09:06\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I'm quite confused on when to start indexing  \n09:06\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0is it on the start of XWiki server or is it human triggered?  \n09:08\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0polx: I also went through solaritas  \n09:09\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0The page tool doesn't have much in it except for few properties like results per page, results found, page count, current page no..  \n09:10\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0Am I missing something here?  \n09:20\u00a0<polx>\u00a0this pagetool is just the nifty thing to avoid doing horrible view computations.  \n09:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0(sorry, I was away on, finally, a successful plug of hypericHQ!)  \n09:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0When to start indexing...  \n09:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I think there several situations:  \n09:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0- incremental updates: this you want always  \n09:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0- empty/broken index: not sure  \n09:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0- manual reindex (e.g. change of schema.xml): human triggered  \n09:31\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0.k... I'l come up with set of overloaded methods for start index  \n09:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I think you need to design this with an admin interface in the head.  \n09:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I tend to feel that these kind of things should be file based... but you sure could use objects to configure.  \n09:42\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I'll modify the API with the suggestions you gave  \n09:42\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0polx: Thanks a lot :)  \n09:42\u00a0<CIA-117>\u00a0Sergiu Dumitriu\u000f master\u000f \\* rdcf57fb\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dcf57fb50f988f24e99373b3baafdc05494002a7 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/render/ListSubstitution.java :\u000f [misc] Improved performance, reduced usage of Apache Oro - http://git.io/yum4pQ  \n09:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0ssavi, you're welcome.
