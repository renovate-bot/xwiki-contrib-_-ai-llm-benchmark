Maybe the perm were set wrong in the db backup that is reset daily  \nsburjan - (14:33): well I know that I don't have full permission on .org, but afaik playground should be accessible  \nvmassol - (14:33): we can fix that when we uprade xwiki.org to 2.6. Can someone fix the perm manually for now?  \nsburjan - (14:33): no, no need  \nsburjan - (14:34): I was just wondering why I don't have access  \nvmassol - (14:34): jvelociter: do you have some time today to finish the xwiki.org upgrade?  \nvmassol - (14:34): sburjan: it needs to be fixed asap  \nvmassol - (14:34): sburjan: are you registered on playground?  \njvelociter - (14:34): vmassol: yes should be able to find the time  \njvelociter - (14:34): there is not too much left to do  \nsburjan - (14:35): I'm not. I go to .org, login, then click on the playground from panel  \nvmassol - (14:35): sburjan: you need to register every time since the db is reset every day on playground....  \nvmassol - (14:35): that's probably why  \nvmassol - (14:35): sburjan: and you read the home page?  \nvmassol - (14:35): :)  \nsburjan - (14:35): nop  \nvmassol - (14:35): well do  \nsburjan - (14:35): I get an epic : You are not allowed to view this document or perform this action.  \nvmassol - (14:35): hmm that's not normal  \nvmassol - (14:35): it should be ok in view  \nsburjan - (14:36): odd thing. I go to .org main, logout, and click on playground, and it works  \nsburjan - (14:36): it's like permissions aren't inherited  \nvmassol - (14:36): sburjan: strange I can view http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome when I'm logged out  \nvmassol - (14:36): it's maybe because you're logged in with your xwiki.org creds  \nvmassol - (14:36): they aren't  \nvmassol - (14:37): let me check them  \nsburjan - (14:37): oh, so playground isnt part of the .org XEM ?  \nvmassol - (14:37): it is but we wanted users to log on it I think  \nvmassol - (14:37): I think we didn't want people to register on xwiki.org jsut to try the playground  \nsburjan - (14:38): yeah.. makes sense  \nvmassol - (14:38): indeed I've checked and only local users have view rights  \nvmassol - (14:38): we should at least allow view rights to others too  \nsburjan - (14:38): but atm this seems to block registered users to go to playground  \nvmassol - (14:38): I'll fix this  \nsburjan - (14:38): great  \nvmassol - (14:40): xwik.org is so slow...  \nvmassol - (14:41): take a minute to click on a right button (at least)  \nsburjan - (14:41): go we use Google Analytics for .org ?

What's the purpose of overflow:hidden when the width/height are not specified?  \nsdumitriu - (16:00): So that the underline doesn't go under floats  \nevalica - (16:00): if you are refering to the Headers - I think is because of the floatingbox that contain toc, etc  \nevalica - (16:01): and yes floatingboxes are floated  \nmflorea - (16:03): why not have a specific rule for this case? i.e. when inside a floating box?  \nsdumitriu - (16:03): No, not inside  \nsdumitriu - (16:03): Next to  \nsdumitriu - (16:04): Open http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise25  \nmflorea - (16:04): I see..  \nsdumitriu - (16:05): And disable overflow:hidden on Hx an Hx span  \nsdumitriu - (16:05): The unferline goes over, not under the toc  \nmflorea - (16:06): ok, makes sense. I'm going to overwrite this in RichTextArea.css because it makes headings uneditable in IE  \nsdumitriu - (16:06): K  \nsdumitriu - (16:07): I'm not sure it's needed for IE at all  \nmflorea - (16:07): well, not uneditable but painful to edit anyway  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 16:12  \nmflorea - (16:23): it seems that in toucan, the overflow:hidden on the span is the one that matters. In colibri, there is overflow:hidden only on the heading, and the only problem I see (on both IE and FF) si that there is no spacing between the end of the underline and the floating box. So the underline goes below the floating box. I'll overwrite the overflow:hidden in RichTextArea.css though to be safe.  \nvmassol1 joined #xwiki at 16:23  \nvmassol left at 16:24 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \ncjdelisle - (16:36): sdumitriu, \"[proposal] A different approach to filesystem attachment storage.\" WDYT?  \nspliffy - (16:40): (filesystem attachment storage)++  \ncjdelisle - (16:41): My proposed method means if you dump files into the right folder, they will show up as attached to the document, changes will be made to the db automatically.  \nsilviar1 left at 16:42 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nEnygma` left at 16:57 (Remote host closed the connection  \nspliffy - (17:02): cjdelisle: sounds really great  \njvdrean left at 17:05 (Quit: Leaving.  \nevalica left at 17:05 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 17:08  \nabusenius - (17:16): wtf?
