 \n14:08\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0i have changes that are appearign in sql that are not in the properties file. \u00a0if it is permissions issue it is failign silently.  \n14:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Good morning, xwikiproperties is a table for containing the properties of all of the objects attached to all of the objects in the wiki so it does not have anything to do with xwiki.properties configuration file  \n14:09\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0ahh  \n14:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*attached to all the documents in the ...  \n14:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0xwiki.properties is somehow related to the document XWiki.XWikiPreferences but you really need to only access that document from inside of the wiki, it's quite inaccessable from the database shell directly  \n14:11\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0i installed the ldap control panel extension, and it constantly tells me that ldap is not enabled as an auth method (which it is enabled in xwiki.cfg) and properties I have set regarding ldap settings are in the db, but are not being written to disk  \n14:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Unfortunately I'm not the guy for LDAP  \n14:12\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0i am running tomcat 8 on server 2102 r2 with sqlserver datastore. \u00a0if i was deploying on linux do you think xwiki would detect if the cfg file was not writable by the servlet container?  \n14:12\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0ive looked pretty closely at the tomcat logs and xwiki is not emmiting any errors  \n14:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0config file should not need to be writable but it certainly must be readable  \n14:13\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0this all worked well with jetty and hsql but i am trying to deploy with tomcat + apache  \n14:13\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0i will reach out to the developer of the ldap admin extension  \n14:14\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0love the project, ty guys for your work  \n14:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If you're looking to help out development and get a nice easy installation, you might look at buying a few days of development time from XWiki SAS or Softec in order to get your system all setup the way you want...  \n14:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0(these are companies who sponsor XWiki development)  \n14:18\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0i wish i could. \u00a0my companies margins are so small im am lucky currently to get a keyboard approved  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:19\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0i will certainly contribute in any way i can, and teach them the value of FOSS  \n14:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Yeap, it's an exciting time to be alive but a tricky time to be in business  \n14:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:39\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:52\u00a0<slestak>\u00a0found the issue. \u00a0do you know the acronym pebcak?
