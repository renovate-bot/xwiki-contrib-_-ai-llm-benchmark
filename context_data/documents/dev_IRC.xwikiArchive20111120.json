I have a version 2.7 database that I have tried to upgrade to 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, but everytime I do, I am unable to edit pages... the WYSIWYG editor continuously spins and the source tab is read-only. I've forced migrations - that doesn't help - I've tried upgrading the XAR-based pages and a lot of other stuff. When I try to upgrade the XAR pages, then logout and try to login it continuous  \n21:10\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0I've checked release notes, installation help for each version, but none of that has fixed my issues  \n21:10\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0I've made sure the Migrator class is properly listed in the xwiki.cfg  \n21:10\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0Not sure what else to do  \n21:21\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0nbetcher: Is it only the WYSIWYG editor that doesn't work?  \n21:25\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0Uh, well, if the 'Source' tab (to edit the source directly) counts as part of the WYSIWYG component, then yes  \n22:23\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:26\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0Tomcat says this when I have permission issues after loading the 3.3 XAR: [http://wiki:8080/xwiki-enterprise-web-3.3-20111119.165914-243/bin/jsx/AnnotationCode/Script?language=en] ERROR o.i.ObservationContextListener - Can't find any begin event corresponding to [class org.xwiki.bridge.event.ActionExecutedEvent (jsx)]  \n22:27\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0the WYSIWYG issue was happening when I loaded the 3.3 WAR, but didn't upgrade the XAR  \n22:31\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0Not sure which is more proper... upgrading the XAR or not.  \n22:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0nbetcher: Sorry, I was away for a while  \n22:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Did you try clearing the browser cache?  \n22:56\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0just did... still the same error. The backend shouldn't be producing that error though  \n22:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Did you read http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise31#HWYSIWYGEditorConfiguration  \n22:59\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0So should I revert my database, then delete XWiki.WysiwygEditorConfigTemplate and XWiki.WysiwygEditorConfig and import it?  \n22:59\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0Those instructions assume I know how XWiki works :P  \n22:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n22:59\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0How do I use the object editor?  \n23:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If you're logged in as Admin you should have it in the Edit menu  \n23:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If not, you can go to your profile and switch to Advanced user (edit profile preferences)  \n23:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0After that you should have the object editor listed in the Edit menu of any page  \n23:01\u00a0<qwebirc96804>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:01\u00a0<qwebirc96804>\u00a0hi  \n23:02\u00a0<qwebirc96804>\u00a0has quit  \n23:02\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0So this is after I deploy the 3.3 WAR, but before I import the 3.3 XAR?  \n23:02\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0or is this as 2.7?  \n23:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Right, between the war and the xar  \n23:07\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0is the XAR deployed into the database or FS?  \n23:07\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0I need to know which to revert  \n23:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Database, but the default DB (hsqldb) is on the FS  \n23:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If you're using something else, then in the DB  \n23:27\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0argh  \n23:27\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0this is so frustrating  \n23:27\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0These instructions are so vague :(  \n23:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sorry nbetcher  \n23:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0By the way, you didn't extract the new war over the old one, right?  \n23:28\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0and the amount of nesting with this stuff is boggling my mind  \n23:28\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0no, I didn't  \n23:28\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0Welcome to the InstyMeds Wiki!\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0XWiki Space\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0WYSIWYG Editor Configuration Class\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0WYSIWYG Editor Configuration Template\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0WYSIWYG Editor Configuration Panel  \n23:29\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0\"remove deprecated properties\" how do I know what's deprecated?  \n23:30\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0They should be listed as \"deprecated\"  \n23:30\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0And when I am in the WysiwygEditorConfig page, the only options under Edit are: \"Wiki, WYSIWYG, Inline Form | Access Rights, Objects, Class\"  \n23:31\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0I click \"Objects\" and it brings me to some weird page that means nothing to me  \n23:31\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0nor does it have any deprecated properties  \n23:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Just delete the whole object  \n23:31\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0delete WysiwygEditorConfig?  \n23:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n23:34\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0and WysiwygEditorConfigTemplate?  \n23:35\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0ok, I see what I need to do now :P  \n23:37\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0Although I don't think this will fix my problem  \n23:37\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0The WYSIWYG issue was happening if I didn't upgrade the XAR. Now that I upgrade the XAR I'm going to have those permission problems  \n23:38\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0yup: \"You are not allowed to view this document or perform this action.\" when I'm logged in. When I log out everything is accessed fine  \n23:40\u00a0<nbetcher>\u00a0and when the permission error is returned, the following shows up a lot in my Tomcat log: [http://wiki:8080/xwiki-enterprise-web-3.3-20111119.165914-243/bin/jsx/AnnotationCode/Script?language=en] ERROR o.i.ObservationContextListener - Can't find any begin event corresponding to [class org.xwiki.bridge.event.ActionExecutedEvent (jsx)]  \n\n"}
