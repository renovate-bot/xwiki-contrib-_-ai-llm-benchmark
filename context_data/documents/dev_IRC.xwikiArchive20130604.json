(working on hierarchy)  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes oldcore  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I said yesterday you can have subcategories if you wish  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(while waiting for new modules to be created in the future)  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0e.g. oldcore-export  \n14:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes but we don't support nested spaces, so I can'd build a hierarchy  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure at all  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*true  \n14:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: XE simply built before platform was done, we need to wait for platform build ending to start XE again  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't need nested spaces to build a hiearchy  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok got it  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0always the same when changing the versions despite the jenkins configration we have that is supposed to deal with that  \n14:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, imagine that I have a directory with several pages (xml pages which model the tests) .. how can I create a hierarchy of dirs ad still be able to import them in the wiki ?  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nothing that jenkins can do  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only solution is to commit in the right order and wait  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(wait before each push)  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commons first, wait, rendering, wait, etc  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0painful  \n14:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it has been committed in the right order and jenkins do have a configuration we used to wait when a dependency is building  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not hte problem  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that if you commit in platform then platform will trigger  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the repos are separate it's separate commits  \n14:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and the platform commit was pushed before the XE one  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but why should jenkins wait?  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no reason  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't know the 2 commits are linked  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/doesn't/cannot  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because we configured jenkins job to wait when one of them dependecy is building  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0he know that XE depends on platform  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but that's wrong  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't care about the comits  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you commit in commons  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then I commit in platofrm something unlreated  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*unrelated  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0platform should build right away  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case I don't know what wait time they have  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I'm not telling you what's wrong and right and reminding you the setup we used...  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and which is still supposed to be in place  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't really control when github will ping jenkins  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it pinged first xe before platform  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure about the setting you mention though, would need to recheck it  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like someone removed that setup from XE  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0platform still have it  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is why it did not failed and waited for commons  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that explains it  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Block build when upstream project is building\"  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has good and bads but I agree the pros are probaby better than the cons for us ATM  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you putting it back on XE?  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0done  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note: I've disabled the cvs plugin for jenkins  \n14:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: any idea where is the Edit Page code ?

I'm gonna continue to annoy you with questions like these :)  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't really need to do that  \n15:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: in this manner I guess that almost all of the top menul (Copy Page, Rename Page, Delete Page, \u00a0Delete Space) are in platform-web  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could have a single XE category for stuff that are in XE, oldcore, web  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the important thing is to match the exsiting paltform modules that are not oldcore/web  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the other ones the tests have not been moved to platform anyway  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're asking question that have no answer ATM really  \n15:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, those which are not in platform-core or platform-web are easy because they have their module :)  \n15:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0like blog, app within minutes, workspaces, document index, etc  \n15:09\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0this is why I am doing this now, because it will be hard to keep synched the structure from the app with the structure from the codebase  \n15:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, any idea where the wiki editor code is ?  \n15:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:05\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grrr I broke http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform%20Quality%20Checks/466/console  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixed  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you just merged the solr indexing thread in platform right? :)  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it mean we can start testing it?  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0It's a bit young but yes  \n16:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is still XWIKI-9200 missing so by default you don't have anything in the solr index in the jetty/hsqldb for example  \n16:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but modifications are indexed now  \n16:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also upgrade to solr/lucene 4.3  \n16:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and did a lot of cleaning/refactoring to improve performences so it's prossible I broke some thing  \n16:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I still need to improve test coverage  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's your plan re lucene vs solr? Will we have both indexes at the same time so that we can compare results?  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: right now the issue is that things like search suggest are still tied to lucene index  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't know if I will have time to refactor it in a more generic way  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for this I need to introduce Result API to query API I think to be really clean  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(SOLR search worked through Query API)  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0works  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but Query API only return plain list of object which is way too simple IMO for advanced use cases  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it is  \n16:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have to go, bb in 1 or 2 h more or less (father duties)  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need query manager to be able to return references too for example  \n16:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I see that in the tests you moved today, you removed the test prefix for the test methods. Are we dropping the convention of naming test methods ?  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this was dropped\u2026 4 years ago ;)  \n17:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0when we switched to JUnit 4 ?  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0before  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when we started using @Test  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually maybe it was junit 4, don't remember  \n17:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, afaik the@Test annotation is the new thing in JUnit 4  \n17:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0(one of the new things)  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Some best practices:  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol> ? Name the Test class with the name of the class under test suffixed with Test. For example the JUnit test class for XWikiMessageTool should be named XWikiMessageToolTest  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Testing  \n17:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, then you recommend I also remove the test prefix from my Test Reporting App ?  \n17:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0actually I won't because they are mapped to the java tests, so it's better to keep the same name  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes to which of them ?
