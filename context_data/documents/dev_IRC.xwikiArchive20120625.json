Is \"Delete\" a technical identifier or can it be translated ?  \n12:00\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0tmortagne, cjd: indeed \"Delete\" was is a key identifier here  \n12:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: so looks lke the modification you have are actually fixing a bug  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: we can use it to test migrations but not all combinations  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not at each major version!  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's at each release that we must upgrade mxwiki.org  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's meant for that  \n12:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so if you release 4.1 and 4.01 and 4.1.1 in the same week, which of them will we choose ?  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the latest  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0myxwiki.org is suppoed to always have the latest  \n12:02\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lunch time, I'm hungry\u2026 bbl  \n12:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: ok, so I am going to prorpose 2 things. 1) when we list db's in the release notes, we should should specify that we are testing only migrations, not a full test (manual or automatic) 2)Upgrade myxwiki.org when a new version is released. Now AFAIK myxwiki.org is usiny MYSQL, so we have at least one database tested with a more advanced/bigger wiki  \n12:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0going to wait for you after you come back to lunch  \n12:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: as far as I can see on l10n wiki it has been fixed by sdumitriu  \n12:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you should really commit those IMO  \n12:07\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ok  \n12:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0because right now delete shortcut probably only work if your UI is in English  \n13:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: could you tell me if the proposal is ok so I can send it to the devlist ?  \n13:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I think some points need to be fine tuned but send your proposal, we can comment on it  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR xwiki commons is only at 62.4% TPC  \n13:50\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:52\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: fyi DefaultVersionRange could have some more unit tests  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a062.4% is only including tests found in xwiki-commons  \n13:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: are you publishing the result ?  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now going to add rendering, platform and enterprise  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0later on yes  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I've included everythin  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could publish separate + aggregated too but it's more work  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll see if I do it or not  \n13:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok vmassol , thanks.
