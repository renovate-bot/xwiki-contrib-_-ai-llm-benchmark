I am North from India. I have had a look at the ideas page and this live notification intrigued me a lot.  \n20:14\u00a0<North>\u00a0I am starting to think if this is some mimic app for Google Drive.  \n20:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Hey North  \n20:14\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0may be kind of we can borrow few ideas from that i gues  \n20:15\u00a0<North>\u00a0any mentor in here so that I can get to know more about the app  \n20:16\u00a0<North>\u00a0any help please ?  \n20:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The idea is that XWiki has serverside events, and clientside notifications  \n20:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But they're not connected  \n20:17\u00a0<North>\u00a0yea... I am aware of the problem...  \n20:17\u00a0<North>\u00a0and moreover I am starting to code around when two or more authors edit a wiki page collaboratively  \n20:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So, you can see some saved event in the Activity page: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/Main/Activity  \n20:18\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Hello.  \n20:18\u00a0<North>\u00a0hey... yea @ sdumitiru  \n20:18\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0If I don't install the xwiki ui package, what choices do I have? is the ui thing unique or can I install all applications contained in it manually?  \n20:20\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0For the Java events: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Observation+Module  \n20:20\u00a0<North>\u00a0yea... exactly !!!  \n20:20\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0like the extension manager, etc?  \n20:20\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0For the JavaScript part: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/XWikiNotifications  \n20:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So, what's missing is a persistent connection between the server and the client through which the server can send some of the events back to the client  \n20:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0webczat: Why don't you want to install the UI package?  \n20:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0webczat: You can indeed install just some of the applications  \n20:22\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0hmm maybe it has things I don't want/etc, or I want to exactly customize what I have installed  \n20:22\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0some events in the sense?  \n20:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0webczat: You can manually install the administration application and the extension manager application  \n20:23\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0webczat: And then use the EM to install what you need  \n20:23\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0and all other things, or there are exceptions?  \n20:23\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0diamond: Well, the user doesn't care about changes in other documents, but should be notified by changes in the current event  \n20:24\u00a0<North>\u00a0yes... so the idea which is listed is very similar to collaborative editing as in Google drive ?  \n20:24\u00a0<North>\u00a0I mean notification stuff... right ?  \n20:24\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I'm not sure how do you download the extension manager if te wiki page does not give the url  \n20:25\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0North: Yes  \n20:25\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0webczat: Which wiki page?  \n20:25\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0extension manager app module description  \n20:26\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0@sdumitriu has anyone else applied for this idea..  \n20:27\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I search for an extension manager in the extension list, then I find descriptions but nothing else  \n20:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0webczat: Hm, indeed the download link is missing  \n20:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0webczat: Pick your version from http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-extension-ui/  \n20:28\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0diamond: So far no, but both you and North are asking about it now  \n20:28\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0i have actually worked on live tiles on windows 8 apps...i code around java and c# all the time so i think i can work on this  \n20:33\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0I know it is kind of late ..but is there any posiblity for me to apply for this idea? i would love to contribute to this  \n20:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, sure  \n20:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's not late yet  \n20:34\u00a0<North>\u00a0cool !! @sdumitriu ... well I just saw the idea and found it really interesting. Moreover, I guess this would really be cool stuff to integrate into Wiki :D  \n20:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The final decision is at the end of May  \n20:35\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0g8 ..:)  \n20:37\u00a0<North>\u00a0so I am planning to add a sample proposal to my Git repos even before posting it on GSoC site. Can anyone be of help in reviewing it ?  \n20:38\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0How can you make xwiki ext manager display extensions made by xwiki team? possible?  \n20:39\u00a0<North>\u00a0?  \n20:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0North: Yes, sure  \n20:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0webczat: WDYM? Only the ones made by xwiki team?  \n20:41\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0yes  \n20:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, doesn't look like it's possible  \n20:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0There's no faceted search  \n20:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But you can do an advanced search  \n20:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Exension ID: org.xwiki.enterprise:xwiki-enterprise-ui  \n20:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Version: your version  \n20:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Click search  \n20:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And go to the dependencies tav  \n20:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0tab  \n20:45\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0and even the live chat integration \"while editing\" seems to fit perfectly for xwiki. And I was thinking if there is any step towards it ?  \n20:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0This will list all the modules shipped by default in XE  \n20:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0diamond: There are a few prototypes  \n20:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But nothing usable yet  \n20:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If you want something That Really Works(tm) I'd use a flash irc client and connect it to an irc server or host your own  \n20:47\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0can u throw some more light on that so that i can think of more abt it and kind of get integrate into it..  \n20:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0The limiting factor is that there is no effective way to stream content through the java servlet system, a secondary issue is that live sockets are deceptively hard to make work  \n20:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0diamond: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/xwiki-platform-chat  \n20:51\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0cant we use input output streams ?  \n21:03\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0@cjd  \n21:04\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0and wat about using filters...@cjd  \n21:14\u00a0<gihanchanuka>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:20\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:20\u00a0<North>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:20\u00a0<diamond>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:07\u00a0<qwebirc59893>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:11\u00a0<qwebirc59893>\u00a0has quit  \n22:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:01\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:52\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit\n"}
