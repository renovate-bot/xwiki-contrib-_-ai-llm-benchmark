I can never get a plaintext password to save to ldap.  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7: what version of XWiki are you using?  \n13:47\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0i am trying to find the version right now, but where?  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0footer  \n13:47\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0XWiki Enterprise 8.3-milestone-2  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder if it's not http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13740  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*mind  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you could do is download the latest 8.3 snapshot and verify it works there  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there was http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13651 too but it was fixed in 8.3M1 and you have M2  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it's still a problem that is not fixed  \n13:52\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0looks like not get fixed...  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I remember is that I had it  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and Marius looked at it and fixed something  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and couldn't reproduce after that  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it's still hapenning in some rare cases, I don't know  \n13:54\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0its a new installation, i just wrote a few pages...  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess you could \u00a0raise a new jira issue and explain how to reproduce  \n13:54\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0i renamed the home page...  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tryinh  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*trying  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then?  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW renaming the home page is failing for me :(  \n13:56\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0i started to build our wiki, renamed the home page, build some subpages and thats all.
