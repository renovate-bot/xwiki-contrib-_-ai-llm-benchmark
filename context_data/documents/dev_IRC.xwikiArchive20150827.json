 \n12:39\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because the entity reference returned is not a skinresource reference  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not supposed to be  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Extract the Entity Resource from the URL\"  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is only for entity resources  \n12:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0well it returns \"type = [entity], parameters = [[skin] = [[colibri]], [colorTheme] = [[xwiki:ColorThemes.Azure]]], reference = [Document xwiki:skins.colibri.style\\.css], action = [skin], locale = [<null>]\" for the url http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/skin/skins/colibri/style.css?skin=colibri&colorTheme=xwiki%3AColorThemes.Azure  \n12:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0which is obviously wrong  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then the problem is not initializeResourceFromURL()  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is correct  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's something happening before that  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does step 3 go inside the \"if\"?  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(of RoutinfFilter)  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're talking about static resources right?  \n12:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0wdym  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see step 3  \n12:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's a file containing velocity code in a fs skin  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so not a static resource  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so nothing to do with SkinsResourceReference  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Represents a reference to a static filesystem skin resource.  \n12:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0we don't go in the step 3  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0skin action is different from the skins action  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so normally there should be no handler  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it should go in step 4 inside the \"if\"  \n12:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes it does  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus it's normal that it reaches initializeResourceFromURL  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as an Entity Resource  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because xwiki considers \"skin\" action to be entities  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(\"bin\" means entity)  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what's not working?

 \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh I see  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean that it's considered as a nested space  \n12:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0doc.getName() returns \"style\\.css\"  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's correct  \n12:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and it should have been \"colibri\" previously I think  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the space part isn't It hink  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n12:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mut then maybe Enygma` is right, we should not rely on this  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know the reason actually  \n12:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*but  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is the same problem as for the zipexplorer plugin  \n12:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cuased by http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12169  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so basically this is not a supported format  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anymore  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what was happening before  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that the actions were reparsing the url  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and they could support url formats that extended the normal entity URL format  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so they coud hack it  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is not true anymore  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commenting in the issue  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commented  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it clear?  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0changing comment since my proposal is actually a hack which isn't good  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we really need to flesh out all Actions that were extending the Entity URL format  \n12:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok I see  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can take that issue if someone takes the javascript api one :)  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lunch for now  \n13:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I'm ok to \u00a0take the javascript one  \n13:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0We should refactor the whole Javscript API at some point  \n13:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because we have some that uses prototype, some that use jquery, some that use AMD  \n13:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0this is not consistent anymore  \n14:08\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:08\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: so are you taking XWIKI-12427 ?  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I've assigned myself to it Enygma`  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it ok?  \n14:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah, right, did not refresh  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe guillaume and you could work together on the js api thing since  \n14:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0sure, since I was going at it by fixing the way the document reference is handled, but you seem to know more about it and what`s going on in the background  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) it's complex  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) we need something for next Monday and Guillaume is off tomorrow...  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: yeah I caused the issue and it's in a domain I've worked on...  \n14:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, cool. I`ll try to help on the JS side, though I`m not sure at what level we want to take it.  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's the hard part, to decide what to do  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:01\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: re what to do on JS API the priority is to add nested support to existing API, for example several things are broken just because what XWiki.currentDocument.getURL return is wrong  \n15:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok  \n15:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I propose to continue the work done by vmassol on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12205  \n15:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0changing the constructor of XWiki.Document, but I think we can do it more simple  \n15:18\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we probably need to look on the number of arguments in the constructor to see if it's the old (backwards compatible) signature or if it's the new one (using references)  \n15:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I just look at the type of the first one  \n15:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0either the first one is a string or a reference  \n15:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0if it's a reference, the other arguments are ignored  \n15:22\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys I'm looking at SkinAction#renderFileFromObjectField() and I see that velocity is only executed if the xproperty name ends with css or js. So does it mean velocity is not executed if the xproperty name is something like edit.vm?
