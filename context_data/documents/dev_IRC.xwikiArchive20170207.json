There are lot of clients..I've no idea which is the better choice, and no idea about prerequises. Any idea ? mflorea, tmortagne, vmassol gdelhumeau  \n15:02\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0erratum: to communicate with Fusion Directory (not LDAP)  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm trying to figure out where the mail went for http://ci.xwiki.org/job/XWiki%20Contrib/job/syntax-markdown/job/master/28/console  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it did say that it sent me an email but I haven't received it  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw not very nice that it's printing my email address :)  \n15:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n15:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ol-ow2: you mean a lib that you could use in XWiki  \n15:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0?  \n15:15\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i guess yes, but i'm not sure :)  \n15:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I know we have some low-level stuff, see an example: http://snippets.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP+Query  \n15:15\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0sorry, not LDAP  \n15:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0now if you want something more specific to Fusion Directory, I can't help you  \n15:16\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i'made a mistake previously  \n15:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0is Fusion Directory based on LDAP?  \n15:16\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i need to communicate with RPC serveur  \n15:16\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0Fusion Directory called the LDAP  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ol-ow2: no idea  \n15:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok se we forget about the ldap thing  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any java lib will work  \n15:16\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0but to communicate with FD, we need use an json RPC Client  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's simple in groovy  \n15:17\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0an example vmassol ?  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks simple  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just googled and saw several examples  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they looked simple  \n15:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it looks like using apache http client, no?  \n15:17\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0and several json client  \n15:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0then you can use ObjectMapper (from Jackson) to parse your JSON  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: no need  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the groovy slurper is good for this  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0much simpler  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*groovy json slurper  \n15:22\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XML-RPC+Integration i find this  \n15:22\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0but it's XML  \n15:23\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i guess i need the same but in json  \n15:23\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0using json format  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are plenty of json examples on e.x.o  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0check the groovy tag in the cloud  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ol-ow2: you should check in http://snippets.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and not on e.x.o)  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some ex here: http://snippets.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/JIRA+REST+Integration  \n15:27\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok, i understand about xlm <=> json example (thanks)  \n15:32\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0that's mean, i need use groovySlurper to transform the request/reply of xml RPC client ?  \n15:33\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i'm a bit lost here  \n15:34\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0FD expect to receive json via RPC protocol from xwiki  \n15:36\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0and xwiki expect to receive XML via RPC protocol from FD  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure what you are talking about XML  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0isn't the subject JSON RPC  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the example vmassol gave you are way to read JSON input in Groovy  \n15:39\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0[15:22:30] <ol-ow2> http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XML-RPC+Integration i find this  \n15:39\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok for read  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0forget about http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XML-RPC+Integration, this is a XWiki API  \n15:39\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0but i need read ans also write  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not some generic XML RPC tool you would used in a script  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to summarize XWiki does not provide you with anything to read/write JSON, you will have to use standard Groovy tools  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I know there is one to read but pretty sure the one to write is not far  \n15:42\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok, :) i understood  \n15:43\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i will make some tests  \n15:44\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0and many thanks for your helps, and showing me the way  \n16:20\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:27\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:16\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has quit  \n17:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:48\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:55\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:45\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n19:48\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit\n"}
