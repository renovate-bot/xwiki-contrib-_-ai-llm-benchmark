Now I need to integrate the result in the wysiwyg editor and update the functional tests. 1-2 days should be fine for me too.  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01-2 days is a lot actually  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it means 3-4 days for the release  \n09:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll move the issues that I don't plan to do for 6.4 final  \n09:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0one more blocker: XWIKI-11670  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: for me it's half a day  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not 1 or 2 days ;)  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I probably only need 1 hour but I put half a day to be safe  \n09:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I need at least one day. But I can also commit the suggest and use it only in the document index for 6.4 final and do the wysiwyg integration in 6.4.1 in order to now delay the release.  \n10:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n10:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:14\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:43\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:55\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:02\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n13:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: are you working on anything for 6.4?  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need someone to work on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11445 , maybe you could help?  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for 6.4 since it's marked critcial for 6.')  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11443 too  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to release 6.4 tomorrow if possible; it's going to be too late for today  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hopefully mflorea and gdelhumeau will have something ready for tomorrow  \n13:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0someone have any idea about: XWIKI-11655 ?  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: AFAIR I handled webajr in HTML epxport laready in the past  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember adding code specific for that  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WebJarsExportURLFactoryActionHandler  \n14:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it seems it is not the factory used  \n14:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0where this url factory is used?
