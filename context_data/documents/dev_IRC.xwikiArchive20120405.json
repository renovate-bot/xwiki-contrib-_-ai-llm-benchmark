 \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0shouldn't it be greyed out?  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or is it to force the install?  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also what does \"provided\" means in the 3rd image?  \n10:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the install button should be disabled I think, the EM doesn't allow to upgrade core extensions  \n10:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0provided means bundled with XWiki Enteprise  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm ok, wasn't clear to me when reading  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0shouldn't it be installed?  \n10:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0nop, those extensions are not installed  \n10:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there is a difference between an extension installed by the user and one that comes with XE  \n10:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0well, by \"installed\" we mean something that the user really installed, by clicking the install button  \n10:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: the ow2 password in the password file does not seems to be taken into account by push-release script  \n10:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not for the scp at least  \n10:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes.. I had to enter it for each artifact too..  \n10:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0a bit anoying  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: yes I know but we need to think from a user POV. I'm not sure provided means anything for me  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/me/them  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Installed (Core Extension)\"?  \n10:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0well, there are a few differences: (1) you can't uninstall \"provided\" extension, but you can uninstall \"installed\" extensions. (2) same with upgrade. You can't upgrade core extensions  \n10:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0for me \"installed\" suggests that it can be uninstalled  \n10:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0that's why I preferred not to display installed for core extensions  \n10:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I haven't read very carefully your comment about the install button. I can't gray it out. I mean, it's not that simple. In this particular case the conflict is on a direct dependency, but in general, the conflict/incompatibility can be on a transitive dependency at any level, so without creating the install plan I can't know if the extension can be installed or not.

I was wondering whether the scope of that project is to just implement Foundation, or whether I should aim for the more broad mobile implementation of XWiki based on foundation  \n13:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:36\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0fundamentally, I was thinking the same thing based on data usage. One aspect of implementation I was thinking of eventually breaking up the css to, still use media queries, but for it to disregard certain css meant for other screens.  \n13:37\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Should this be included in my proposal, or is this way in over my head. I apologize, this is actually my first time trying to get in on this open source dev business, so I'm not exactly sure what i'm doing. In fact i'm not even sure if I should be asking here, so I apologize in advance  \n13:42\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0hi jssolichin - the objective of creating a skin is simple, it will help us cover all the areas, mobiles, tablets and desktop. I am not familiar with Foundation (let me get a quick look) but I think the project was proposed in order to simplify the amount of work needed to be done  \n13:44\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0jssolichin: I am not sure about what past mails you are referring to, from what I remember the discussions refer whether to native solution versus responsive layouts  \n13:45\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0jssolichin: regarding the communication zone, the IRC and/or the mailinglist are valid solutions, but the mailinglist are asynchronous and could attract multiple responses  \n13:50\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0jssolichin: imo, the objective is to build a responsive skin, i don't really care if it's based on foundation or not. actually I would prefer not to depend on a third party dependency, but using a framework may be easier.

I was hoping to set more time for that, but alas schedules made that hard. iirc, gsoc gives us time to read over the api and get acquainted with the system? but regardless, I would probably have/will try to get ahead after submitting the proposal during the mentor judging phase.  \n14:08\u00a0<CIA-120>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* rc8f14e8\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/c8f14e8cb390b24df15f2d181a73ebe0128240d9 \u000f/ xwiki-commons-core/xwiki-commons-extension/xwiki-commons-extension-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/extension/repository/internal/local/CollectionExtensionPropertySerializer.java :\u000f XCOMMONS-146: Extension descriptor not properly saved in local repository - http://git.io/fyLObQ  \n14:08\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Evalica: Sweet, I wasn't sure if Foundation was a primary goal. I think you are right, in not trying to depend on third party, it gives us more flexibility. That being said, I think the early part of my proposal would then be to assess the value of using a framework/starting from scratch. I have began working with responsive in my latest project (surprisingly for my portfolio aha, (in case. http://jssolichin.com)) and I do feel lik  \n14:11\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Evalica: sans framework as it will make the overall codes slightly skinnier in terms of removing unneeded aspects, such as buttons and forms \u00a0style. That being said, again since I'm not completely familiar with the XWiki skin code base, I will still need to make a thorough assessment. \u00a0Though I think the Colibri skin, the original anyway, seems to be \"simpe (relatively)\" and could possibly serve as responsive design base.  \n14:11\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0tmortagne, I know you are busy, but if/when you have 5 minutes to checkout the LDAP UI doc I've just written at http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP+Application and do a quick review, that would be great  \n14:12\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0(FYI all I'm leaving tonight and will be mostly offline until wednesday next week)  \n14:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: finishing with import stuff and will look at it  \n14:13\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0thanks  \n14:14\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<CIA-120>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r87571bf\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/87571bf8a30f28e1aa9248f730c32849b337f012 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-extension/xwiki-platform-extension-repositories/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-xwiki/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-xwiki-server-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/extension/repository/xwiki/internal/DefaultRepositoryManager.java :\u000f XWIKI-7689: Possible java.lang.NullPointerException when importing an Ex  \n14:17\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:17\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan`>  \n14:17\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Evalica: I think, an area of exploration that I was considering was the use of slider as a content control--that is, it might be beneficial to have (say on a dashboard/homepage) to have the title, and a slider to show contents to increase the use of the limited space. I was inspired by foundation's integration of slider (orbit).  \n14:18\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Evalica: But since there is a chance to not use third party framework, I have found blueberry(a standalone slider for responsive) to maybe suffice as a simpler method.
