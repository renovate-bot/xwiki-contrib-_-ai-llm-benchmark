This is very likely to create a memory leak  \n13:27\u00a0<StefanS\\_>\u00a0and 100% CPU  \n13:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0The issue with the tomcat log is known, it's not a memory leak in the sense of eating up more and more memory as time goes by, what tomcat is complaining about is that when XWiki is shut down something doesn't get removed properly so stopping an individual webapp while leaving the jvm running might cause issues.  \n13:31\u00a0<StefanS\\_>\u00a0OK, wath can i do ?  \n13:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0When you stop XWiki just stop the JVM and it will be fine.  \n13:32\u00a0<StefanS\\_>\u00a0but wath is the reason ??  \n13:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0100% cpu usage is expected for a short period because the integrated search engine needs to catalog all of the pages, how long is it running at 100%.  \n13:33\u00a0<StefanS\\_>\u00a0more at 15min.  \n13:47\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:12\u00a0<jas02>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<jas02>\u00a0Hi, I need to index external page included into the Xwiki using html macro and <iframe>. My question is, it's possible with Solr indexing engine?  \n14:18\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0jas02: not out of the box  \n14:19\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Solr indexing engine is experimental anyway for the moment  \n14:19\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but it's definitely possible  \n14:19\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0a \"rendered content\" indexing mode/option would interesting actually  \n14:22\u00a0<jas02>\u00a0jvelo: And it's stable enough to be deployed in production enviroment?  \n14:22\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0no  \n14:22\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it's still in development  \n14:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0right now the default search engine is lucene  \n14:23\u00a0<jas02>\u00a0And it's because of instablility of Solr itself or it's because implementation in Xwiki?  \n14:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it's because we are not done implementing it in XWiki  \n14:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0we aim at replacing the lucene plugin with the new sold module ultimately  \n14:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0solr  \n14:25\u00a0<jas02>\u00a0jvelo: OK, thanks for the info. Last question, is there some roadmap when will be Solr stable enough for production?  \n14:25\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0that should happen in the 5.x cycle I think, though I'm not sure what's the plan  \n14:25\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Eduard would know but he's not here today it seems  \n14:26\u00a0<jas02>\u00a0Right now, is there some other option to index external html content?  \n14:27\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0out of the box not really  \n14:28\u00a0<jas02>\u00a0jvelo: Thank's for the information  \n14:28\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0no problem  \n14:29\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0if you hang around here I'm interested in discussing with Eduard hooks for indexing external content easily in Solr  \n14:29\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it sounds like a common use case  \n14:31\u00a0<jas02>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n14:42\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n14:55\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: any tough about https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8650 ?  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i'm interested because it can caused conflict during DW  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cause  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since Blog is setting it I was hopping you have any idea what this field is and i it should ends up in the DB or not  \n16:01\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: Looking  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:28\u00a0<StefanS\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:33\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:47\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
