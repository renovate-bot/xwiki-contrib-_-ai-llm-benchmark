 \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's soemthing to fix  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking why  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that's easy to understand  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's because we don't call clirr on platform tools at all, which is ok I think  \n09:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we don't consider them an API I guess  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're considered internal tools ATM  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jsut for our usage  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I still need to understand why clirr runs when I type mvn clirr:check there  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok got it  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0skip is false by default, I'll put it to true  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixed :)  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, we should fix our ci jobs today so that we're ready to release on monday  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw tmortagne what's your status for the RC1 release?  \n09:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I fixed webstandards and I'm debugging the rest test failures now  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan/msmeria: maje sure you test thomas' nex export (see release notes)  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*make  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*new  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lets say ready considering that import will be missing I guess, better concentrate on the release than rushing it  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: so no import?  \n09:44\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: as soon there is a newer snapshot on maven.xwiki.org  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0too short for import yes I think  \n09:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0won't take me too long but more than 1 day so too short for 5.2 I guess  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: don't forget that you need to enable the new export engine (see release note)  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's 2 days it might fit :)  \n09:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: ping me when you're finished with it so I can test it  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you still have a few days  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0release is on monday  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for RC1 yes  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the final it's next week  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0putting a new feature after RC1 is not very nice  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not indeed  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if you'e not touching anything existing maybe we could allow it  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a01 week is perfectly enough but not sure we want it  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we could postpone the RC1 by a few days  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends how much you nee  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's 2 days of delay it's ok I think  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie \u00a03 business ddays from now)  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a01 week is enough but not 100% sure how much I need, probably better to not postpone the RC1  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's ok to put t after RC1 I can do it I think  \n09:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it would be disabled by default like export anyway so I guess it's safe enough  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case you need to work on it even after RC1 whether it's included or not right?  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can keep the same schedule and decide at the last moment  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what is in the top of my TODO list anyway yes  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if you do it on a branch or keep it not pushed)  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we are suposed to create a branch for 5.2 during RC1 release anyway  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we branch now  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(now = RC1)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we could decide on the merge from master to the 5.2 branch at the last moment  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we could  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm mvn clirr:check -Plegacy,integration-tests fails on platform  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[INFO] XWiki Platform - Legacy - Old Core ................

 \n10:00\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I run clirr twice for M1 and M2 since I removed the dependency to jtidy and I didn't got any complains about missing dep  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you ran on legacy?  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I ran on all platform  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0with legacy profile on  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0like documented in the release process  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then you should get it, you can try it locally  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I did it locally :)  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have it too?  \n10:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I didn't have it one week ago  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed no jtidy dep  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking where it's used  \n10:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0platform-feed  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it means that the aspectj plugin doesn't bring transitivie deps?  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would be strange  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what this has to do with aspectj ?  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why would be embed jtidy in oldcore-legacy ?  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/be/we/  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the only issue for me is why the hell CLIRR complain about a dependency  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becuase it finds it somewherein our code  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is an issue then  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking why  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or maybe in the old code from 5.1  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see why would would have this class in olcore  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so the reason is because clirr needs to analyze both the current classes and the ones from 5.1  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in 5.1 TidyMessageLogger was in oldcore  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to add the jtidy dep in legacy-oldcore for now  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll do that  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but just for clirr  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if TidyMessageLogger was in olcore all you can do is exclude it  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0CLIRR is not supposed to look at dependencies  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah I guess I can also do that  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't look at dependencies  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the best IMO  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is not a dep  \n10:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"(10:35:00 AM) vmassol: so we need to add the jtidy dep in legacy-oldcore for now\"  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is maven  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not clirr  \n10:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and ?
