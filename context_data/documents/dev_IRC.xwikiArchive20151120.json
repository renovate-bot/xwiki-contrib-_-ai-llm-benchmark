 \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure as for everyone else  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anywhere in a sentence  \n12:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeap  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I never type a user name, always use tab-complete, very handy  \n12:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's an unfortunatel missing feature in skype that you can't highlight people  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIR  \n12:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well my visible name has spaces so it would have to be like \u00a0\u00a0@'Caleb James DeLisle' or something heh  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my bad, I thought I had seen some prefs for this but can't find them so it probably doesn't exist  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for skype on mac)  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(there are plenty of other notifs but not this one apparently)  \n12:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's kind of related to the nickname system in IRC which other chat solutions did not copy  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all the others chat solution I use support this  \n12:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If the person's name has spaces in it, it's not easy to notify them  \n12:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Oh hey, off-topic... we need a \"like\" button on the extensions instead of 1-5 stars, people don't know what to do with stars  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you know the best solution to get the first space name when you have an EntityReference of type EntityType.SPACE?  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because removeParent() and then getRoot() is not very nice  \n12:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand your question actually, do you have an example ?  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki:space1.space2  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have this as an EntityRefernece of type SPACE  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I want space1  \n12:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well getParent()  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nazh  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki:space1\u2026.spaceN.page  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I want space1  \n12:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0384 extensions installable with the EM  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was thinking about introducing a getFirstReference(EntityType type) or something like this  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in EntityReference)  \n12:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so you need some kind of extractLastReference  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: \u00a0you have that info in XWiki directly btw  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0extractFirstReference actually yes  \n12:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, but now I have the IDs :) \u00a0so I can pound elasticsearch for stats on them  \n12:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0last because the EntityReference start with page  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we alrady have getLastSpaceReference  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it would't be logical to change the order  \n12:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it badly named actually  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me it's correct  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other around would be wrong  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we write left to right  \n12:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0getLastSpaceReference return the first found SPACE reference so it's a pretty bad name from EntityReference point of view  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0EntityReference is not a String  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it returns the last one  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't change anything  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0root is root  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not bottom  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you alwazys start with root  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our EntityRef isn't organized from bottom to root, it's organized from root to bottom  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0apart from the naming  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is there a better solution than removeParent followed by getRoot right now?  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actuallt a loop probably is as good  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0will do a \u00a0loop even though it's a pain  \n12:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: why don't you add a method ?  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you mean in my code or in EntityReference?  \n12:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if there is a need and you are working on SNAPSHOT and not some extension I would add a new helper  \n12:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds like a valid use case that would be in the API  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I've added this in my code: https://gist.github.com/vmassol/c2068be9ce7c53dbb27c  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes  \n12:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/would/could/  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like it to be in EntityReference (or something like this)  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's a generic use case IMO  \n12:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's EntityReference job yes  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I'll send a proposal on the list  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the naming part  \n12:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess because of getLastSpace we don't have much choice for the naming now  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be a pain to change it  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and as I said I can rationalize it  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the 2 naming are correct IMO  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it depends how you view it  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0most of the other EntityReference view things from the lowest element (it's not extractLastReference for example)  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just extractReference so it's neutral  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but should have been called extractLastreference IMO :)  \n12:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0neutral means give me the first one, like String.indexof  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what happened is that I started the API  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and my vision was left to right since I believe this is the easiest for users  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but then other decs have added apis  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*devs  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and they may have not followed this vision  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0question: is it normal that I don't see XWiki.XWikiPreferences in the AS (when I have show hidden docs) when I make a change the rights in the admin UI?  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have some special handling for XWikiPreferences?  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm not sure that extractReference() is correct: it returns the current entity if it doesn't find an entity matching the passed type. I'd have expected null because it means calling code may need to test the type of what's returned as a consequence..  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne and others: let me know if http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12845 is ok for you  \n13:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(bbl lunch)  \n13:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it does not return this  \n13:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it start with this and got from parent to parent until reference is null  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it will return null if it does not find anything  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok good  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/got/go/  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing javadoc  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any comment regarding XWIKI-12845?  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand what is wrong about the javadoc  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not saying it will return this if it does not find anything  \n13:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's saying it mayb return this if this is of the asked type  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it doesn't say what it returns if the type is not found  \n14:06\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0committing  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can always rollback if someone is not happy  \n15:23\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n15:36\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:41\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n16:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:49\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:31\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:37\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n17:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:59\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:08\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:02\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:01\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
