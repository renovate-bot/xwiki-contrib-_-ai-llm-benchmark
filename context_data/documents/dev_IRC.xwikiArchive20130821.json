The import of this page partially failed, with the above exception, as the code property of the JSX is empty and he cannot save or delete that page. Ofc, uninstalling the extension fails.  \n11:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Initially I though the problem was the fact that the value of the code property is too large, but this should trigger a different exception. So it must be something else.  \n11:39\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0is this mysql on InnoDB?

I sure can implement it but I can't believe it has not been done.  \n14:12\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Also, I am looking at a scrambled display (source-scrambled, user-visible).  \n14:30\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0poix: the current obfuscation of the users email is in the XWiki.XWikiUsers \u00a0class  \n14:30\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0you can replace it by your own implementation there  \n14:30\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0just go to the class editor and open the email property  \n14:32\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0(At least it was there last time I checked .... in 5.0.3 .... long ago ;)  \n14:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Thanks @camil7.  \n14:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0So no module that has a contact form?
