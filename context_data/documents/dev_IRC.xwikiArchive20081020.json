I want to extended DBList. I've made extensions of the DBList and DBMetaList classes. now can i \u00a0have to \"register\" this   \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:07): oops  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:08): do i have to register the property somewhere to make it show up?  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:23): phreeza: Hi. Yes I think you have to patch the core to do this right now  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:26): jvelociter: hm... ok. that is what i was trying to avoid... any idea where i would have to look?  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:28): yes, unfortunately you don't have much choice. We will surely improve that but it will not happen very soon. I think first you need to have your property mapped in the xwiki.hbm.xml file  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:29): (phreeza: )  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:29): I don't know that part of the core very well, but you should take a look at classes under com.xpn.xwiki.objects in xwiki-core  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:31): jvelociter: ok thanks i will look there. it is mapped already, i'm just missing the displaying of the property when editing the class...  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:31): phreeza: then maybe you just miss a modification in the object editor velocity template  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:31): let me look...  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:33): phreeza http://fisheye2.atlassian.com/browse/~raw,r=11508/xwiki/platform/web/trunk/standard/src/main/webapp/templates/editobject.vm  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:33): this is the template that displays the object editing UI  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:33): phreeza: oups, actually I am wrong, this is not the place you are looking for  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:34): it's a panel in fact  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:34): ah yes, it is a dropdown in a panel  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:36): ah ok i think i'm getting it  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:36): #foreach($prop in $xwiki.metaclass.properties) looks like i have to ad it there  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:37): yes, in Panels/AddObject?editor=object  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:37): maybe you can hardcode/add your prop in the list  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:39): jvelociter, yea i think i am about to figure it out. thanks for your help. i'm going to lunch now then i will look further  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:39): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/objects/meta/MetaClass.java  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 14:40): that's what i hava to modify  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 14:40): ok phreeza, have fun with it :)  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 14:44): Applications.MonitoringApplicationDownloads was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jbousque (Added comment) - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/MonitoringApplicationDownloads  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 15:12): jvdrean: Salut  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 15:13): The trashbin says you've deleted this page : http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/AdminApplicationDownloads/  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 15:13): was that on purpose ?  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 15:15): oh ok, I understand  \njvelociter - (20/10/2008 15:15): it has been renamed  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 15:15): Applications.MonitoringApplicationDownloads was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvelociter - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/MonitoringApplicationDownloads  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 15:16): Applications.MonitoringApplicationDownloads was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvelociter (Added comment) - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/MonitoringApplicationDownloads  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 15:58): AdminGuide.Installation was modified by xwiki:XWiki.NatoIne (Added comment) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 16:07): Main.WebHome was modified by xwiki:XWiki.RaffaelloPelagalli (Added comment) - http://skol.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 16:32): i have a dumb question... how do i print something to the page from a groovy script?  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 16:33): oh haha got it, never mind  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 18:20): what version of groovy does the current release of xwiki use?  \nvmassol - (20/10/2008 18:33): phreeza: an old version right now... groovy-all-1.0-jsr-06  \nvmassol - (20/10/2008 18:33): we're planning to upgrade to a newer version soon though  \nvmassol - (20/10/2008 18:34): (soon = before end of the year)  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 18:37): vmassol: ah ok. that would be great. I'm trying to map an existing database with relations to the xwiki classes.... preferably only using scripting from the runtime, not patching or writing plugins. it is more difficult than i thought. I understand that from groovy 1.1 it is possible to dynamically change existing methods which would allow me to mod the DBList property for my needs  \nphreeza - (20/10/2008 18:38): which would be a pretty hacky solution but i don't really care as long as it is written in the wiki and not a patch  \nvmassol - (20/10/2008 18:44): phreeza: yeah that would be hacky ;)  \nvmassol - (20/10/2008 18:44): phreeza: we're slowly migrating the whole xwiki to components so it'll be possible to modify all parts of xwiki more easily in the future  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 19:37): XWiki.KumarKarthik was modified by XWiki.KumarKarthik (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/KumarKarthik  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 20:22): XWiki.gfitch was modified by XWiki.gfitch (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/gfitch  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 21:26): XWiki.BrianJones was modified by XWiki.BrianJones (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/BrianJones  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 21:27): XWiki.BrianJones was modified by XWiki.BrianJones (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/BrianJones  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 21:29): AdminGuide.Security was modified by xwiki:XWiki.BrianJones (Added comment) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Security  \nxwikibot - (20/10/2008 22:24): FAQ.StructuredDataTutorial was modified by XWiki.BrianJones (Added comment) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/StructuredDataTutorial  \n\n"}
