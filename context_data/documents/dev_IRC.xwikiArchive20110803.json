Can someone enlight me :)  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03.1 > 3.0.1  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's true that it's possible that some bugs that were fixed after 3.1 was released could have been incorporated in 3.0.1 and in 3.2-SNAPSHOT  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(thus not in 3.1)  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since 3.0.1 was released after 3.1  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hope this helps ;)  \n15:47\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:50\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<maggo>\u00a0Hi vmassol, so the right package is xwiki-manager-mysql-3.0.1.zip for my XEM Update?  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how would I know that? :)  \n15:55\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want 3.1 it's not the right package  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want only a bug fix release of 3.0 then it's correct  \n15:57\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:58\u00a0<maggo>\u00a0i want the newest xem version but it's not clear how to update it to 3.1 if that is the newst one, oh i should mention that i don't use Jetty i use a tomcat application server. so I don't know if i can use the jetty package for my tomcat. Thats so confusing for me because i documented the way how to update and i followed this documentation since the last 10 updates and now the package that i downloaded the last times is not the same now  \n16:02\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maggo: XEM package with mysql and not jetty never existed, it's either XEM war without the mysql connector or the ready to use jetty/mysql package and always been like that  \n16:07\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the only thing that changed in the name of the jetty/mysql package  \n16:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it used to not contain jetty in the name  \n16:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0because there is only jetty packages distributed for XEM but it has been changed to be aligned on XE  \n16:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0for upgrade you should \u00a0use the war package and takes the mysql connector from your previous install  \n16:09\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0did you look at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation#HUpgradinganXWikiInstallation (which is indicating to use the war package to upgrade) ?  \n16:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:15\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has quit  \n16:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:18\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys (tmortagne), any idea why the invitation test is failing on agent-3? http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Functional%20Tests/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/1/testReport/junit/org.xwiki.test.ui.invitation/InvitationTest/testSendMailToTwoAddresses/  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems there's a mail issue but AFAIK we're using greenmail in the test  \n16:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not sure about this test but we are using greenmail for sure in others  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I checked and we're using greenmail  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's as if greenmail wasn't started  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't see any error in the console about starting greenmail  \n16:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0any other test failing because of greenmail ?  \n16:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0are watchlist test working for example ?  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well there's this error: http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Functional%20Tests/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/1/testReport/org.xwiki.test.ui.watchlist/WatchThisPageAndWholeSpaceTest/testWatchThisPageAndWholeSpace/  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but only one watchlist test is failing)  \n16:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it seems  \n16:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep only one is sending mails  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the error there is different:  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Caused by: org.xwiki.component.manager.ComponentLookupException: Can't find descriptor for the component [role = [org.xwiki.rendering.renderer.PrintRendererFactory] hint = [default]]  \n16:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm does not looks like mail related issue  \n16:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\"Can't find descriptor\" seems pretty serious issue in the build  \n16:24\u00a0<maggo>\u00a0tmortagne: yes i know that way but i'll use it the way i documented so its not the newest version but my stable way i know.
