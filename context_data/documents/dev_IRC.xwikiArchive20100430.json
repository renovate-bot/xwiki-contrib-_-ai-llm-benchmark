are we doing something wrong?  \ntmortagne - (10:59): Probably because of HtmlCleaner  \ntmortagne - (11:01): it's parsing the html content and then rewrite a xhtml content and i guess for some reason it's expending the div element  \njvdrean - (11:02): I also have an issue with the rendering, I've reported it there http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Sandbox/HeadingsTest  \ntmortagne - (11:02): lucaa: pretty sure we have a jira issue talking about that  \nlucaa - (11:03): ok, I'll go vote for it  \ntmortagne - (11:03): jvdrean: that's normal, header is generated by the parser and at this point all the parser have is the macro  \nlucaa - (11:03): it can cause a lot of pain, especially when for a <div class=\"clearfloats\" />...  \ntmortagne - (11:05): lucaa: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-4005 but it seems closed actually  \ntmortagne - (11:05): it's not exactly the same thing  \nSvenDowideit left at 11:05 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nlucaa - (11:06): no, it's not at all the same thing  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 11:06  \nlucaa - (11:06): I don't want it expanded, I just want it closed  \nlucaa - (11:06): somehow  \ntmortagne - (11:06): but it's the same way to handle it  \nlucaa - (11:06): so that all the rest of the content doesn't go in  \nsdumitriu - (11:06): tmortagne: No, it's not at all related  \nlucaa - (11:06): handle at code level or what, i don't understand?  \nsdumitriu - (11:06): It's not that the div is closed  \ntmortagne - (11:07): sdumitriu: it is because htmlcleaner has no way to remember if the div was compacted or no when its wrinting the xhtml  \ntmortagne - (11:07): so it has to choose  \ntmortagne - (11:07): between always compacted or not  \nsdumitriu - (11:08): No, that's not the issue  \njvdrean - (11:08): tmortagne: so I guess I have to use custom params to set correct ids  \nlucaa - (11:08): the issue is that it doesn't read it as closed, it seems  \nsdumitriu - (11:08): The div is not closed at all, it's not a problem between closing it short or long  \nlucaa - (11:08): so it doesn't serialize it as closed (compact or not, I don't case)  \nlucaa - (11:08): care  \ntmortagne - (11:08): jvdrean: actually i'm not sure you can do that, the custom param will probably be overwritten  \njvdrean - (11:09): I've just tried and it works  \ntmortagne - (11:09): sdumitriu: wayit i missread something then, i don't see how it could not be closed indeed  \ntmortagne - (11:10): looks like a htmlcleaner important bug  \ntmortagne - (11:11): jvdrean: ok  \njvdrean - (11:11): tmortagne: but should'nt we generate random ids when we miss title content ?  \ntmortagne - (11:13): jvdrean: the way it's done it's just take macros as no content and that it miss content, also the goal of header ids to to taget then, it's it's random it's pretty useless  \ntmortagne - (11:14): only thing i see is to generate an id in the xhtml renderer with the final content when the header id from the XDOM is empty  \ntmortagne - (11:14): that would do it i guess  \ntmortagne - (11:14): it's juts unusable by macros  \ntmortagne - (11:14): (which is why ids are generated by the parser)  \nSvenDowideit left at 11:15 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \njvdrean - (11:15): so:  \njvdrean - (11:15): 1/ generate random ids, not human readable but usable by macros like toc  \njvdrean - (11:15): 2/ use final content in ids, human readable but not usable by toc  \njvdrean - (11:16): do I get it right ?  \njvdrean - (11:16): if so 1/ sounds better to me, I'm think tocs are way more used that manual anchors\\  \ntmortagne - (11:17): lucaa: i just tested on http://tuska.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/viewTest/Div and i can't reproduce it, <div/> is transformed into <div></div> so it's more complex that that it seems  \nlucaa - (11:17): wait a sec  \ntmortagne - (11:18): jvdrean: it's not that much about human readable or not, it's about stable id  \ntmortagne - (11:18): when you have [[Space.Page#Hsomeheader]] link in another page  \nlucaa - (11:18): try html clean false  \nlucaa - (11:19): ( tmortagne )  \ntmortagne - (11:19): lucaa: clean=false is doing nothing  \nlucaa - (11:19): what?  \nlucaa - (11:19): you mean no difference, but not that it's unused attribute, right?  \ntmortagne - (11:20): lucaa: the gaol of clean=false is to make sure the content of the html macro is not touched and written as it is in the final xhtml content  \nlucaa - (11:20): well, we just discovered that it is actually closed in the content sent  \nlucaa - (11:20): but  \nlucaa - (11:20): compact closed  \nlucaa - (11:21): and browsers mess it up, most probably because we send it as text/html  \ntmortagne - (11:21): lucaa: hos do you test your content exactly ?  \nlucaa - (11:21): (which has no compact form)  \nlucaa - (11:21): just a second  \ntmortagne - (11:21): are you using \"View selection source\" ?\\*  \nlucaa - (11:21): no, I am looking at what's displayed  \nlucaa - (11:22): I have a <div class=\"clearfloats\"  \nlucaa - (11:22): which if not closed it will hide anything inside  \nlucaa - (11:22): since it has fixed height of 1 px et all  \ntmortagne - (11:22): ok but that's \"browsers mess\" as you said it's not related to rendering  \nlucaa - (11:22): yes, we just discovered it now  \ntmortagne - (11:22): it's probably why htmlcleaner expednds div element i guess  \nlucaa - (11:22): but it doesn't  \ntmortagne - (11:22): because of some browser bugs  \nlucaa - (11:22): that's the potin  \nlucaa - (11:22): point  \nlucaa - (11:22): lemme test  \nlucaa - (11:22): more  \ntmortagne - (11:22): lucaa: it does  \ntmortagne - (11:23): again when you user clean=false you don't use htmlcleaner  \nlucaa - (11:23): no it doesn't anymore  \nlucaa - (11:23): I just modified your page  \ntmortagne - (11:23): it doe sin http://tuska.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/viewTest/Div ...  \ntmortagne - (11:25): lucaa: <div/> is transformed into <div></div> in \u00a0http://tuska.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/viewTest/Div how is this not expended ?  \nlucaa - (11:25): tmortagne: if html clean=false \\_and\\_ a space between tagname and / it doesn't  \nlucaa - (11:25): I usually put the space when I put attributes because of browser behaviour  \nlucaa - (11:25): as in  \nlucaa - (11:26): i modified the page now to \\_not\\_ close it  \ntmortagne - (11:26): lucaa: why are you talking about clean=false ?  \nlucaa - (11:26): check it out  \ntmortagne - (11:26): again clean=false do nothing and that' sthe point of it  \nlucaa - (11:26): ok  \nlucaa - (11:26): mmh  \nlucaa - (11:26): I see what you mean  \ntmortagne - (11:27): if you put wrong html in it that's your choice we will not clean the html with clean=false...  \nlucaa - (11:27): it's not wrong :)  \nlucaa - (11:27): as per the xwiki doctype ;)  \nlucaa - (11:28): or then, we should have an xhtml macro  \nlucaa - (11:28): if html macro means I cannot write xhtml in it  \ntmortagne - (11:29): lucaa: why can't you write xhtml in it ?  \ntmortagne - (11:29): you can write whatever you want with clean=false  \nlucaa - (11:29): because it's sent as text/html to browser and browsers will mess it up, as in not understand compact closing  \nlucaa - (11:29): it's long discussion, I need to finish something else now...  \nlucaa - (11:29): conclusion is that it's not a rendering bug  \ntmortagne - (11:30): i don't see what html macro has to do with what XWIKI is sending  \ntmortagne - (11:30): it's two totally different things  \ntmortagne - (11:30): have a xhtml macro will not change anything  \nlucaa - (11:32): it could transform xhtml that I write in html that xwiki sends but that's wjhat html does too, except that clean=\"false\" inhibits this  \nlucaa - (11:33): it's messy, as I see it  \nlucaa - (11:33): we should not send html  \nlucaa - (11:33): or browsers should look at the doctype  \ntmortagne - (11:34): i agree that we should not send html but AFAIK we are doing that because of IE6  \ntmortagne - (11:34): sdumitriu would know better  \nsdumitriu - (11:34): Yep, ie6  \nsdumitriu - (11:34): Not even 7 understands xhtml  \nlucaa - (11:34): I'll go back to my code...  \ntmortagne - (11:41): CalebJamesDeLisl: i don't know if it's due to your change to support custom UI but there is a \"</p>\" without any \"<p>\" before it at the begining of the admin section content  \ntmortagne - (11:43): we really should find some way to execute XHTML and WCAG validation on admin sections  \ntmortagne - (11:43): since we currently have invalid pages and don't know it  \ntmortagne - (11:55): jvdrean: WDYT about adding support for explicit list of URL to validate in the AbstractValidationTest ? That would cover admin use case and any other view we never validate (like testing some editors view for example)  \ntmortagne - (11:56): (we could also validate applications that showing different things depending on the parameters)  \njvdrean - (11:57): tmortagne: I also had this in mind but it'll generate a \\_lot\\_ of work once activated  \njvdrean - (11:57): (at least for WCAG)  \njvdrean - (11:57): xhtml validation would be a good start  \ntmortagne - (11:57): that' measn we really need it then :)  \njvdrean - (11:58): sure but it also means we need someone to take care of it  \ntmortagne - (11:58): not showing them doe snot make them not exist  \ntmortagne - (12:00): do you have code already for this ?  \nannacondan left at 12:00 (Quit: annacondan  \njvdrean - (12:00): hum no, all the code has been commited  \ntmortagne - (12:00): anyway i'm talking about a explicit list for now we can put whatever we want in this list, having the support for it doe snot add anything  \ntmortagne - (12:01): jvdrean: are you sure, AFAICS AbstractValidationTest only parse xar files  \ntmortagne - (12:02): it does not look at any other property than pathToXWikiXar (and documentsToTest to filter it)  \njvdrean - (12:02): I've been thinking about more testing but haven't coded what is needed for it  \ntmortagne - (12:02): ok  \njvdrean - (12:03): (actually what I was thinking at first was calling the edit/ and inline/ actions on all the pages from the XAR)  \ntmortagne - (12:04): jvdrean: i don't think we really need to call edit on all pages since it would be more to test theses view UI validity i think  \njvdrean - (12:05): yes I agree calling edit on a single page is enough, not true for inline though  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 12:06  \ntmortagne - (12:06): yes inline is different since it's like calleing a rendering with different parameters  \njvdrean left at 12:19 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa left at 12:33 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 12:33  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 12:46  \nsdumitriu left at 12:46 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nlucaa left at 12:46 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 12:47  \nannacondan joined #xwiki at 13:03  \njvdrean left at 13:06 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 13:12  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 13:21  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:41): tmortagne: There are a few instances of {{html}}</p> \u00a0.......... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<p>{{html}} \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0because with the old renderer that was the only way I could figure out to make valid html.  \ntmortagne - (13:42): CalebJamesDeLisl: i seen the clean=false html macros but still there is a html macro starting with a </p> without any <p> in a previous html macro  \ntmortagne - (13:43): here is a result of velocity macro with wiki=false: http://pastebin.com/nkrk3Du5  \ntmortagne - (13:44): CalebJamesDeLisl: unless there is a <p> outside of the admin section content ?  \ntmortagne - (13:44): i looked because html validator doe snot like that page  \ntmortagne - (13:45): (i'm talking about the velocity macro in ConfigurableClass page)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:47): Do you know where the offending </p> is? \u00a0I think maybe the best thing to do is get rid of all {{html}}</p> \u00a0\u00a0and <p>{{/html}} since the new renderer doesn't need them.  \ntmortagne - (13:48): CalebJamesDeLisl: it's somewhere in ConfigurableClass code but i did not tried anything  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 13:49  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:02): I removed the <p> and </p> tags and now registration section is valid.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:12): XAADMINISTRATION-138  \narkub joined #xwiki at 14:16  \ntmortagne - (14:24): CalebJamesDeLisl: ok thanks, i just finished to add support for explicit URL in XE validation tool, i will add some admin related pages  \nkibahop left at 14:25 (Read error: Operation timed out  \nplunden1 left at 14:29 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nbbc581 left at 14:42 (Remote host closed the connection  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 14:46  \nplunden1 joined #xwiki at 14:53  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 14:54  \nbbc581 joined #xwiki at 14:55  \nannacondan left at 14:55 (Quit: annacondan  \nplunden1 left #xwiki at 15:09  \nevalica left at 15:22 (Quit: Leaving.  \nannacondan joined #xwiki at 15:23  \nplunden left at 15:49 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 15:52  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 15:55  \njvdrean left at 16:08 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne - (16:14): CalebJamesDeLisl: see http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/764/testReport/com.xpn.xwiki.it/XHTMLValidationTest/Validating\\_XHTML\\_validity\\_for\\_\\_\\_xwiki\\_bin\\_admin\\_XWiki\\_XWikiPreferences\\_editor\\_globaladmin\\_section\\_Registration/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:16): Yes fixing now.

Is there a short description?  \ngvallarelli - (20:20): unfortunately no :D  \ngvallarelli - (20:21): anyway about multiagent coalition formation  \ngvallarelli - (20:21): I will implement an algorithm to create a coalition given a set of agents in C  \ngvallarelli - (20:21): It's a question of time and things will be more clear  \ngvallarelli - (20:21): I'm at the beginning  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:24): C seems a bit obsolete, at least it's not C++  \ngvallarelli - (20:25): CalebJamesDeLisl: yep, C is more simple and straightforward than C++  \ngvallarelli - (20:25): also books on C++ are about 1000 pages :D it's a shame  \ngvallarelli - (20:26): not for the books but for the language so complex  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:26): I remember hearing the language spec had grown to some ridiculous number of pages.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:27): My understanding of C++ is it was a failed attempt to apply object orientation to C.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:29): I don't really like C either because bad code can just construct a pointer and call any function it wants.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:30): And the runtime errors: \u00a0\" Crash at 0xABCDEF Message: I hate you. \"  \ngvallarelli - (20:32): today I was studying about pointers and pointer arithmetic and fascinates me  \ngvallarelli - (20:32): I understand that could be a source of many errors  \ngvallarelli - (20:33): but one thing that I like is that there are so little and tiny abstractions, for the first time no one made the decisions for me on which things to abstract.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:34): Also you can easily port your code to run on nvidia GPUs which are fast. Like 500 cores.  \ngvallarelli - (20:35): eheh cool!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:38): If you're bored, there's a great video about making software secure by controlling what it can get references to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL5o4PFuxTY  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:39): If you can only have what you are given and you can load classes, you are pretty well boxed in.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:39): \\* and you can't load classes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:40): Constructing arbitrary pointers breaks that concept.  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 20:40  \ngvallarelli - (20:42): CalebJamesDeLisl: yep  \ngvallarelli - (20:43): I love subtitles  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:43): A paper I read a while back was about cryptanalysis on the nvidia gpu. http://eecm.cr.yp.to/pc109-20090901.pdf  \ngvallarelli - (20:43): CalebJamesDeLisl: you study and read a lot of things, I hope you study CS :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:44): I guess I do.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:45): Anyway what I found interesting about the paper was that you should have more threads than you have cores so when one blocks, the other can pick up.  \ngvallarelli - (20:45): CalebJamesDeLisl: cool video thank you!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:46): It's really neat stuff, there's a whole community around the concept of \"object capability security\"  \ngvallarelli - (20:50): CalebJamesDeLisl: interesting I'm watching it right now  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 20:55  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 20:56  \ngvallarelli - (21:35): CalebJamesDeLisl: I was thinking that using immutable data structures improve a lot security because it's impossible to corrupt data, so functional languages are more secure than side effect slave programming languages  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:37): Looking up side effects, still a bit ambiguous, can you give me your definition?  \ngvallarelli - (21:40): side effects happens when you accomplish a task with a function for example and alter object state  \ngvallarelli - (21:40): substitute function with method  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:43): Yes. I don't think it's a problem when a method alters the state of it's object, but it shouldn't be mutating parameters.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:43): Also IMO java should never have gotten the static keyword, there is no good use for it.  \ngvallarelli - (21:46): if something strange happens and for example a method don't complete his execution you could have a corrupted object with a very bad state  \ngvallarelli - (21:46): wait somewhere I bookmarked an interesting article about it  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 21:46  \ngvallarelli - (21:48): CalebJamesDeLisl: is a little related to problems about altering state http://damienkatz.net/2006/04/error\\_code\\_vs\\_e.html  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:48): Then where does the data go?  \ngvallarelli - (21:49): look at the article it's better explained than I could do :S  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:50): Haha firefox. Javascript is safer, but I can still get it to segfault :P  \ngvallarelli - (21:51): :P  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:02): \"In every popular language, the updating of a variable means the previous state of that variable is destroyed, vanished, gone and you can't get it back\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:03): Not necessarily.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:08): \"(photo of actual atom)\" \u00a0LOL  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:11): Interesting article. He didn't mention copy-on-write!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:13): Our code is littered with document.clone() invocations so that document saving can't break the document in the cache.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:14): Prototype (javascript) \u00a0Object.extend() returns the same object except changes to the new object are separate from the old one. AFAIK  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:15): So it's like clone but it doesn't require so much processor horsepower and RAM.  \ngvallarelli - (22:24): interesting :)  \ngvallarelli - (22:25): got to go  \ngvallarelli - (22:25): good evening/night  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:25): See ya. One last thought, security and error handling are the same.  \ngvallarelli - (22:25): goodbye CalebJamesDeLisl  \ngvallarelli - (22:26): thank you for the conversation  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:26): Thank you.  \ngvallarelli left #xwiki at 22:26  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:32): 'getAllMatchedUsers' in \u00a0class com.xpn.xwiki.plugin.rightsmanager.RightsManagerUsersApi threw exception com.xpn.xwiki.XWikiException: Error number 3223 in 3: Exception while searching documents with SQL [, BaseObject as obj where doc.fullName=obj.name and doc.fullName<>? and obj.className=? order by doc.name asc]  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:32): JDBCExceptionReporter \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Operation requires a scrollable ResultSet, but this ResultSet is FORWARD\\_ONLY.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:32): getusers.vm  \nsdumitriu left at 23:33 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \n\n"}
