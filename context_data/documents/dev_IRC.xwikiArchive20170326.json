I've done a bit of lisp and camel light during my studies. But in any case nowadays what's important is not so much the language but the ecosystem/tooling/ability to find developers. For a pet project it's fine ofc and interesting to learn from a curiosity perspective.  \n11:17\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0I had some friends over and we were talking about roughly this problem on Friday night  \n11:18\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0You can make your code approachable to \"mediocre\" developers and then really good ones won't be interested to work on it, or you can go ahead and make the code very high quality and it will not be accessible to anyone except the best but the best will enjoy working on it...  \n11:19\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0Can do in 50 lines with a handful of macros what normally takes 500 or 600 but then you need engineers who understand macros and really get the underpinnings of the language  \n11:20\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0old but good: https://printer-bath-38758.netlify.com/archives/654/  \n12:05\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:50\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n14:23\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:31\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<marcules>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<moep>\u00a0has quit  \n20:56\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n21:21\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:23\u00a0<bromero>\u00a0has quit  \n21:27\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:37\u00a0<marcules>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<keithy>\u00a0has left #xwiki\n"}
