That's what causes http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12878  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it just does not initialize it at all ?  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does seems to initialize the ExecutionContext since the right Classloader is put in the Thread  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes I don't think it initializes it ATM. It's left to the handler right now AFAIR. I didn't get the time (and didn't need it so far) to have it done globally for all handlers. This would be an improvement probably.  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not so much about XWikiContext for itself but more the fact that without XWikiContext you don't know the current wiki which is important to load the right components, classes  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is happening here  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm pretty sure most resource handlers should know the current wiki to behave correctly, without talking about resource handlers that load stuff from the database  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree  \n12:00\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<Ramona3>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:40\u00a0<Ramona3>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:13\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n14:15\u00a0<Ramona3>\u00a0has quit  \n14:15\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:34\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:34\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n14:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: there's a compiler error in InfinispanConfigurationLoader.java on the stable-6.4.x branch, in case you didn't see it  \n14:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: indeed I did not see, checking  \n14:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0thanks  \n14:41\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:13\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0hi all. does anybody know if it's possible to change the display name of a wiki?  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Trefex: yes, you can edit that wiki's descriptor  \n15:14\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0doh  \n15:14\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0..  \n15:14\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: thanks :)  \n15:20\u00a0<Trefex-1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:23\u00a0<Trefex-1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:23\u00a0<fca>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:30\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0another silly question really, i understand the [[]] syntax for making links  \n15:30\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0but somehow it doesn't work to link to other sub-wikis  \n15:31\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i tried [[wikiname:WebHome]] and variations of that  \n15:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0[[wiki:Main.WebHome]]  \n15:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0should do it  \n15:33\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah damn thanks cjd  \n15:33\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so close :D  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes you forgot the Space part  \n15:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0[[wiki:Main.

Put maintenance to 1 in xwiki.cfg, do a backup, then update, then update each sub wiki individually?  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure what maintenance property you are talking about  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0first thing is making sure you can put back easily you previous 7.1.x state  \n15:47\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0store.migration or whatever  \n15:47\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0for that i can snapshot the VM i suppose  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess that should do it  \n15:47\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0oh, perhaps i could clone the snapshot and try on the clone...  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what we do for xwiki.org  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0upgrade the clone and when all is ok switch IP  \n15:48\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah mhhh  \n15:48\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i rather carry out upgrade procedure on the main no?  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that means putting the other one as readonly  \n15:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0why?  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that you don't loose modification done in the previous one while you are upgrading  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise anything done by user during the upgrade will be lost  \n15:50\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0no i mean if i upgrade the main  \n15:50\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i don't have to care about that right?  \n15:50\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i mean i upgrade clone and main  \n15:50\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0in that order  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but it all depends if access is critical for you or if you can just say \"maintenance today, don't come\"  \n15:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yeah, oh because if somebody else access the website, it could screw up the upgrade process you mean?  \n15:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think so but they will see things moving, might have some issue with wiki half upgraded, things like this  \n15:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0is it actually possible to put the wiki in \"maintenance\" mode?  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends what you mean by maintenance  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is a readonly mode  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or you put some message in your apache saying that maintenance is running  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that nobody access the wiki except you  \n16:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:37\u00a0<mouhb>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0creating repo for mohamed  \n16:46\u00a0<mouhb>\u00a0Thank you vincent  \n16:48\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i think upgrade worked  \n16:48\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0UI is completely different :D  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I hope you like it :)  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0feedback welcome on the list !  \n16:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0well first off i can already tell that I don't like that I can't see if i'm logged in or not  \n16:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0and if yes, as which user  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mouhb: done, see mail  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what version Trefex?  \n16:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: can you see the warnings i get in catalina since the upgrade?  \n16:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0https://paste.fedoraproject.org/298213/95034381/  \n16:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: well 7.3  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can see your avatar  \n16:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yeah ok, i meant at least a \"Log In\" menu could be on the top  \n16:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0my users will call me searching for the \"Log In\" menu :)  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's at the top  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the drawer menu where all top level actions are located now  \n16:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yes in the drawer menu  \n16:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0which is not intuitive  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok would be great if you could play a bit with it and send us some email on the list with feedback  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(no need to hurry, take your time to use it ;))  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because here any message is going to be lost  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n16:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0lol well  \n16:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0true  \n16:54\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: did you see the pastie i sent?  \n16:57\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0mhh, now my xwiki is not starting anymore  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Trefex: sorry busy  \n17:01\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: no worries, i guess i have to revert back to 7.1.2, the wiki is not starting at all  \n17:14\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n17:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Trefex: what kind of installation is that?

 \n18:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it's not stuck at Downloading extension whatever  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends what internet you are talking about actually  \n18:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0since 5 minutes  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's between you and your wiki or the wiki and internet  \n18:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0the uni has some shitty firewalls and routers, and we regularly have stalled downloads using wget, curl or whatever  \n18:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0in the range of 80-85%  \n18:18\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0which just happened to me, so was wondering how to resume  \n18:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the upgrade process is running on server side and what you see is just a refresh of the current state  \n18:18\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yep  \n18:18\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0server side curl / wget get stalled all the time  \n18:19\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0been fighting with networkign people since 2 years, who claim there's no issue with them  \n18:19\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0but that there's bug in wget...  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so loosing internet won't change much for the upgrade process ecept that sometime you will have to get back your connection to unlock the upgrade asking you for some conflict or nest step  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/nest/next/  \n18:19\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yep, that is nice, but what to do when the server is stuck because the server downloads got stalled?  \n18:20\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0should i just restart tomcat?  \n18:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure what you mean, if XWiki cannot download what it need to will see an error  \n18:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you can retry  \n18:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no reason it get stuck because of that  \n18:20\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok, right now, since 10 minutes, the upgrader is stuck at \"Downloading extension ....\"  \n18:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is a timeout on XWiki side  \n18:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what you see is the last status you were able to get but if you have issue between you and your wiki then you see an old status  \n18:22\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0that connection is fine  \n18:22\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0well if there's a timeout, i guess i have to wait  \n18:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK the download timeout is a lot less than 10 minutes so not sure what can be your issue  \n18:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case as I said before if it's really stuck in a download it did not started upgrade anything  \n18:23\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i'll rstart tomcat and see what happens  \n18:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so killing it should not break anything  \n18:25\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok seems to be working now  \n18:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: where's your beer tap ?
