Sound good?  \ncjdelisle - (09:55): hmm also removing the constructor since it extends and duplicates the one in Element.  \ncjdelisle - (09:55): and getName() ;)  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 09:59  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 10:01  \njvdrean left at 10:01 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsilviar left at 10:08 (Quit: Leaving.  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 10:10  \nfmancinelli left at 10:21 (Quit: Ex-Chat  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 10:25  \nfmancinelli left at 10:26 (Remote host closed the connection  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 10:27  \nsburjan - (10:30): vmassol, : ping  \nvmassol - (10:31): pong  \nsburjan - (10:31): Hello.  \nsburjan - (10:31): I am having troubles with the LiveTableElement  \nsburjan - (10:32): class  \nsburjan - (10:32): The constructor for a LiveTable takes a livetableId using xpath, but I am unable to locate any id in my livetable  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:34  \nsburjan - (10:34): maybe I'll have talk toSergiu about this  \nsburjan - (10:34): I see he's the one that committed  \nvmassol - (10:35): all livetable have an id  \nvmassol - (10:35): I don't understand the probleml  \nsburjan - (10:36): I hava some methods that fail in that class. hasColumn and waitUntilReady don't work for me  \nsburjan - (10:36): \\*have  \nvmassol - (10:37): you can check how it's used in some existing tests  \nvmassol - (10:37): check if they work  \nrstavro joined #xwiki at 10:39  \nvmassol - (10:40): we should disable sending hudson emails for escaping tests till they are fixed  \nvmassol - (10:41): IMO  \nvmassol - (10:41): personally I know I'm not looking at hudson emails anymore since I receive too many of them and not looking is bad  \ncjdelisle - (10:42): Same here for the most part, then we would need to disable more than just the escaping tests.  \ncjdelisle - (10:42): (good morning BTW)  \ncjdelisle - (10:43): Any objections to adding http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Email-ext+plugin to hudson?  \ncjdelisle - (10:44): I read about making emails with nice counts and graphs using groovy, might be able to cook something up. Just a single periodic email with failure counts, and regression counts for various areas would be much better IMO.  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 10:44  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 10:45  \nvmassol - (10:46): I don't know much about email ext plugin but sounds good. Maybe we need to talk about what we would like from the hudson emails first?  \nvmassol - (10:46): IMO we need a mail to be sent ASAP whenever there's a failure  \nvmassol - (10:46): but without any \"false positives\"  \nsburjan - (10:47): sdumitriu, : ping when you have some free time  \nsdumitriu - (10:48): Pong  \ncjdelisle - (10:48): \"ASAP whenever there's a failure\" you mean regression? \u00a0\u00a0Obviously I am not very experienced with software dev culture but it strikes me that testing should \"grade\" the software and if no test ever fails then they are too easy.  \nsburjan - (10:49): I am writing an automated test for the bug fixed regarding Filtering atachments from DocumentIndex (what I've been working yesterday too). I am using the LiveTableElement class you wrote, but I want to say that there is at least one method that fails. I am refering now to hasColumn(String name);  \nsdumitriu - (10:50): Vincent wrote that class  \nsdumitriu - (10:51): So, how does it fail?  \nvmassol - (10:52): sburjan: this class is new and not finished so it's possible it has bugs that need to be fixed. If you're on it, can you fix the problems?  \nvmassol - (10:52): maybe hasColumn is not used anywhere yet  \nvmassol - (10:52): and thus is not working yet  \nvmassol - (10:53): (I don't recall)  \nsburjan - (10:53): it is used in an assert in AllDocsTest  \nvmassol - (10:53): I know filterColumns used to work when I wrote the class  \nvmassol - (10:53): ok so it should be working if AllDocsTest pass  \nsburjan - (10:54): I am investigating  \nsburjan - (10:54): yes, filetColumns works  \nsburjan - (10:55): but I can't figure it out .. using it with assert fails too  \nsburjan - (10:56): I'm wondering how come it doesnt fail in AllDocsTest  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 10:57  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 11:04  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 11:09  \nsburjan - (11:25): vmassol, \u00a0: can I extend AllDocsPage ?  \ncjdelisle - (11:28): If something is broken on AllDocsPage then it should be fixed, if you're representing a different wiki page then extend it.  \nvmassol - (11:28): no alldocspage shouldn't be extended  \nvmassol - (11:28): since we don't have a wiki page that extends it  \nvmassol - (11:29): by extend do you mean java extend or simply to modify it?  \nvmassol - (11:29): if it's to modify, of course it should be modified and improved  \nvmassol - (11:29): :)  \nvmassol - (11:29): if you're not sure about modifications ask here or on the list  \nsburjan - (11:30): adding new stuff.. what it currently support is only click index tab  \nsburjan - (11:30): I am creating a test and i have to go to Attachments Tab  \nsburjan - (11:31): so I should create a method that goes to Attachments tab  \nsburjan - (11:31): which it seems i am unable  \ncjdelisle - (11:32): ViewPage should already have one.  \nsburjan - (11:33): cjdelisle, \u00a0: I am talking about other Attachments Tab. Not the Page attachments tab. I am talking about the Attachments tab from AllDocsPage .. the livetable  \ncjdelisle - (11:33): oh haha never mind then.  \ncjdelisle - (11:34): You might be able to copy code from the ViewPage function though.  \nsburjan - (11:34): and by default when you land on that page, the index tab is default. And switching to another is giving me problems ...  \ncjdelisle - (11:34): It's a strange click --> wait for tab to appear type thing that happens.  \nsburjan - (11:34): because if i create analogically methods to switch to the other tabs, doesntw ork  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 11:35  \ncjdelisle - (11:35): did you try stopping the test after the tab is clicked on?  \ncjdelisle - (11:35): (to see what happens visually)  \nsburjan - (11:36): well the test fails because it can't finr the xpath element .. but it is there.. I think ittries to click too early .. before loading of the livetable  \ncjdelisle - (11:36): waitUntilElementVisable?  \nsburjan - (11:37): yeah, this is what amI doing  \nsburjan - (11:37): at least trying  \ncjdelisle - (11:37): So it never becomes visible?  \nfmancinelli left at 11:38 (Read error: No route to host  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 11:38  \nsburjan - (11:39): it becomes, but I guess it clicks too early  \nsburjan - (11:39): let me try  \nsburjan - (11:41): works :)  \nsburjan - (11:41): I'm gonna create a method for all the livetables within that Livetable  \nsburjan - (11:41): and after go in deeper into LiveTableElement  \nsburjan - (11:48): nop  \nsburjan - (11:48): this won't cooperate with me  \nsilviar left at 11:48 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa left at 11:48 (Quit: Leaving.  \nphancox left #xwiki at 11:49  \nraluca joined #xwiki at 11:52  \nsburjan - (11:55): seems that livetable.waitUntilReady breaks if called from main program. It works only when called within AllDocsPage. Can't yet explain it  \nsburjan - (11:56): more exactly the isReady() method fails  \ncjdelisle - (12:04): IIRC the javascript for the table had to be modified to support that function.  \ncjdelisle - (12:05): Trying out mvn3, looks like ${pom.version} is deprecated, should i change to ${project.version} or is mvn2 dependent on ${pom...  \nflorinciu left at 12:08 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 12:23  \nsburjan - (12:36): it seems that there is an xpath problem  \nsburjan - (12:36): but I'm unable to figure it out  \nlpereira left at 12:36 (Read error: Operation timed out  \ncjdelisle - (12:37): can you hang the test right where it's failing?  \nsburjan - (12:38): I'm debugging, and I know where it fails  \nsburjan - (12:38): because it can't find an xpath expresstion within hasColumn()  \nsburjan - (12:38): and that method works just fine on index tab, but fails on Attachments tab  \nflaviusolaru left at 12:39 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmflorea left at 12:41 (Quit: Leaving.  \ncjdelisle - (12:41): I can only suggest hanging the test there and then using firebug and xpather to try to figure out what to look for.  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 12:41  \nsburjan - (12:47): now I see that the xpath works only for only one Column  \nsburjan - (12:47): so doesnt seem to be universal  \ncjdelisle - (12:50): I like id or even className better than xpath, I think it's faster and id is definitely 'cleaner'.  \nsburjan - (12:52): let's see if I can find a better solution  \nbblfish left at 12:53 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 12:54  \ncjdelisle - (12:58): hmm. Clierr failed the build over making final something which cannot be modified and removing a method which could not be accessed.  \nbblfish left at 12:59 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nsburjan - (13:03): sdumitriu, : can you please confirm that the xpath expression : //th[contains(@class, 'xwiki-livetable-display-header-text') and normalize-space(text()) = 'Page'] doesnt work on Index Tab from DocumentIndex ? And also that Actions tab works ? (If youhave xpather installed)  \nflaviusolaru left at 13:06 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan - (13:07): I mean Page, Space, Date filters do not work, and Action filter works ... I can't explain  \nsburjan - (13:15): found the problem, but the DOM differs .. so this is really ugly xpath  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 13:17  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 13:27  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 13:30  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 13:33  \ncjdelisle - (13:33): Would anyone have a problem if I s/${pom.version}/${project.version}/, s/${version}/${project.version}/ and s/${pom.artifactId}/${project.artifactId} every pom.xml in platform?  \nsdumitriu - (13:33): +1  \ncjdelisle - (13:34): Ok, I'll commit it then.  \ntmortagne - (13:35): +1 if it works with Maven 2.2  \nsdumitriu - (13:36): Works  \nsdumitriu - (13:36): That's what I have  \ncjdelisle - (13:37): Hmm. I should probably check again with 2, I built with 3 no problem.  \nvmassol - (13:38): cjdelisle: I didn't change it since I thought it wasn't working with Maven 2.x  \nvmassol - (13:38): but worth checking  \nvmassol - (13:38): otherwise +1 from me too  \ncjdelisle - (13:38): I thought I saw it used in one place. I'll try building though.  \nvmassol - (13:39): maybe they added support for it in 2.2 but it wasn't supported in 2.1 or something like this  \ncjdelisle - (13:40): I just made a commit which clierr is breaking the build over (worked fine in mvn3 ;) ) I sent mail to the list about it, I would like to suppress the error rather than rolling back the revision.  \ntmortagne - (13:42): cjdelisle: I answered your mail  \ntmortagne - (13:42): look at core-parent pom.xml  \ncjdelisle - (13:43): Thanks, I was asking more because I feel that I shouldn't suppress a clierr break without asking formally on the list.  \ntmortagne - (13:43): i don't think it's a clirr plugin mail you should send but an api breakage mail  \ntmortagne - (13:44): you commit the API change then clirrhas to be configured anyway  \ntmortagne - (13:44): s/you/if you/  \ncjdelisle - (13:46): I'll remember to put that in the subject line from now on. I didn't think of this as an api break until I saw the hudson build had failed.  \ncjdelisle - (13:49): Well since this is being reported as an api break and I don't see major support, I'll merge it out now and then ask on the list if it's ok to recommit.  \nflorinciu left at 13:53 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsburjan - (13:54): vmassol, \u00a0: fixed the issue  \nsburjan - (13:54): with help from mflorea  \nlucaa left at 13:54 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (13:55): sburjan: ok cool  \ncjdelisle - (13:56): last 2 parts of my computer come today, it'll be nice being able to do other stuff (reasonably fast) while compiling.  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 13:56  \nsburjan - (13:57): what computer did you buy ?  \nsburjan - (13:57): or what parts ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:01): opteron 6128, 8 gigs of ecc ram, asus twin socket mb, enermax galaxy psu, some kind of heatsync and a azza cheap frame.  \ncjdelisle - (14:01): only 2.0Ghz proc though  \ncjdelisle - (14:03): http://www.tbreak.com/tech/files/ASUS\\_KGPE-D16\\_image1.jpg <-- that mb  \nsburjan - (14:09): twin socket mb ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:10): yea, only got one proc though.  \ncjdelisle - (14:10): Weird thing about these procs is that they each have 2 physical dies in one module so it's sort of a duel proc.  \nsburjan - (14:10): oh, so you're going for a server architecture .. with multiple physical CPUz  \ncjdelisle - (14:11): I figured they can't get away with selling junk to the enterprise customers.  \nsburjan - (14:11): estimated price of the mobo ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:12): $430? don't remember exactly.  \ncjdelisle - (14:14): 440 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131643  \ncjdelisle - (14:14): It's my 10 year computer.  \nsburjan - (14:15): wdym 10 year computer ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:15): Computer should last me ~10 years.  \nsburjan - (14:15): oh ... I see  \nsburjan - (14:15): the mobo looks like a blade server mobo :)  \nsburjan - (14:16): but I'm sure it's not a blade server one  \ncjdelisle - (14:16): Yea it'll fit into a 1u case.  \ncjdelisle - (14:16): ibm, dell and acer are building servers with the same proc so I guess it runs decent.  \nsburjan - (14:17): yeah ...  \ncjdelisle - (14:19): I'm happy that it supports full hardware virtualization so I can delegate hardware to the guest os and even when the hardware device dma's to ram, the addresses are translated on the northbridge.  \nsburjan - (14:20): I'm not so familiar with virtualization technology  \nsburjan - (14:20): I know that CPU must support it  \ncjdelisle - (14:21): You create a guest opperating system and it's memory addresses must start at 0, so you allocate some ram starting at some address and now the proc has to translate all the memory lookups made by the guest to the real memory address.  \ncjdelisle - (14:23): problem comes when the hardware (video card) tries to write to ram. It's read and write operations need to have their addresses translated if it's assigned to a guest os.  \nsburjan - (14:23): oh, i understood  \nsburjan - (14:23): but I thought this is managed bythe Virtualization App .. like VMware, etc  \nsburjan - (14:24): the host only sees that these kind ofapp use lots of RAM  \ncjdelisle - (14:24): It is/was but that was sloooooow.  \ncjdelisle - (14:24): Imagine having to add a number to the memory addr before each ram lookup. That's why emulation takes forever.  \nsburjan - (14:25): and now there is hardware capable of handling this in a better way ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:25): It has an adder right in the memory controller I guess.  \nsburjan - (14:25): yeah, and Vmware is able to support this ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:25): They talk about near native speed so it's pretty good.  \nsburjan - (14:26): because I guess this kind of software has to support the hardware in order to function  \ncjdelisle - (14:26): Yup vmware, xen, kvm all support that.  \nsburjan - (14:26): interesting  \ncjdelisle - (14:26): I'll probably try playing with xen.  \ncjdelisle - (14:27): Another neat thing is if you encrypt your hard disk and someone wants the key, they want to read the ram memory.  \ncjdelisle - (14:28): You can dump a computer's ram with the firewire port.  \ncjdelisle - (14:28): But if I delegate the firewire device to the guest, only the guest's ram can be dumped.  \ncjdelisle - (14:29): Anyway, it's an excuse to play with xen.  \ncjdelisle - (14:29): haha and virus will fail miserably on my machine.  \nsburjan - (14:31): you're gonna run only \\*nix familit ?  \nsburjan - (14:31): family  \ncjdelisle - (14:31): yea, probably. I'd love to have winx for autocad and mastercam but swaping video card from one os to another is tricky.  \ncjdelisle - (14:33): Probably use stripped down debian live cd (on flash drive) for the hipervisor, and maybe ubuntu for the default guest.  \nnpm - (14:37): FYI, gmorning caleb -- i found the audio card you need, and if i wasn't full up on audio cards, i'd get it myself at this price http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&Item=200519263727  \ncjdelisle - (14:39): Thanks, I don't have an ebay account and this thing will be a long time before it's ready to even connect to the network but I'll take a look.  \nnpm - (14:39): just thought i'd pass it along ^^ cjdelisle  \nnpm - (14:40): the card will be long gone if nobody's looking and you happen to get the first bid like i did on http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=290470230872&  \nnpm - (14:40): then you get a good deal  \ncjdelisle - (14:41): 8 analog inputs,  \ncjdelisle - (14:41): \\*8 analog outputs \u00a0\\*24 Bit/96 kHz \u00a0erm what for?  \nnpm - (14:41): well, recording 8 channels of audio, or doing 7.1 audio  \nnpm - (14:41): but at that price, you can just appreciate a decent D/A and A/D that's all going on outside the computer  \ncjdelisle - (14:42): the price is definitly right.  \nnpm - (14:43): that's why i mentioned it to you... it's a good quality card, which would still go for over $100.00 normally  \ncjdelisle - (14:44): trying to find some better pics of it (while compiling.........)  \nnpm - (14:44): and well supported by linux \\*bsd etc  \nnpm - (14:44): snd-ice1712  \nnpm - (14:45): http://nielsmayer.com/envy24control/EWS88D\\_Board\\_L.jpg  \nnpm - (14:45): oh wait that's mine  \nnpm - (14:45): see the link in http://mudita24.googlecode.com/  \nnpm - (14:46): ^^^ my update to software that controls this class of soundcard  \nnpm - (14:47): hmm actually it's almost exactly this ftp://ftp.terratec.net/Audio/EWS/88MT/Manual/EWS88MT\\_Manual\\_GB.pdf  \ncjdelisle - (14:47): cool. I kept running in to pics of these monster racks with parallel cords to the pci card.  \nnpm - (14:47): phase88 is update to that one  \nnpm - (14:48): this \u00a0mounts in a drivebay or separate (which is better, put it near audio eq)  \nnpm - (14:48): anyways remember that ytou mentioned you didn't have problems compiling xwatch w/ recent xwikis?  \nnpm - (14:48): i did...  \ncjdelisle - (14:49): What's the problem?  \nnpm - (14:49): i got 2/3's compiled but was stopped at not finding a gwt-linux from maven repos  \nnpm - (14:49): basically couldn't build the gwt-client part  \nnpm - (14:49): the server built  \nnpm - (14:49): the wikis built  \nnpm - (14:50): [INFO] Unable to find resource 'com.google.gwt:gwt-dev:zip:linux-libs:2.0.3' in repository central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2)  \nnpm - (14:51): i followed the second option in http://watch.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Installation#HBuildingandinstallinganXWikiWatchSnapshotoveranexistingXWikiEnterprise  \nnpm - (14:51): \"go to gwt-client, gwt-server, wikis modules (in this order) and type mvn clean install in each of them\"  \nnpm - (14:52): problem is i couldn't find (googling) that lib either  \ncjdelisle - (14:53): I'm guessing it's in the googlecode repo but I'm not seeing anything yet.  \nnpm - (14:53): it's not...  \nnpm - (14:54): but it seems like it's a build error in the first place  \nnpm - (14:54): why would it be looking for os-dependent stuff for the client?  \ncjdelisle - (14:56): maybe it's trying to download an optimized compiler.  \nnpm - (14:56): eek  \ncjdelisle - (14:57): It compiles java into javascript (backwards I know) and it might be using linux optimizations in the compilation (which doesn't make the js platform dependent.)  \ncjdelisle - (14:57): can you pastebin the error?  \nnpm - (14:57): sure... one sec  \nlpereira joined #xwiki at 15:00  \nnpm - (15:02): http://nielsmayer.com/npm/xwatch-error-gwt-client.txt  \ncjdelisle - (15:05): find-grepping  \ncjdelisle - (15:06): Also think I found the sound card http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr04/images/terratecphase88.l.jpg  \nnpm - (15:06): INFO] [dependency:unpack {execution: unzip-gwt-libs}][INFO] Configured Artifact: com.google.gwt:gwt-dev:linux-libs:2.0.3:zipDownloading: http://maven.xwiki.org/externals/com/google/gwt/gwt-dev/2.0.3/gwt-dev-2.0.3-linux-libs.zip  \ncjdelisle - (15:06): It is definitly quite impressive.  \nnpm - (15:07): yep, i wish i hadn't bought some other ones now, i'd have bought that one  \nnpm - (15:07): INFO] [dependency:unpack {execution: unzip-gwt-libs}][INFO] Configured Artifact: com.google.gwt:gwt-dev:linux-libs:2.0.3:zipDownloading: http://maven.xwiki.org/externals/com/google/gwt/gwt-dev/2.0.3/gwt-dev-2.0.3-linux-libs.zip  \nnpm - (15:07): that's where it all goes wrong ^^^  \nsburjan - (15:18): sdumitriu, cjdelisle : ping  \ncjdelisle - (15:18): yea?  \nsburjan - (15:19): I have done the writing the test  \nsburjan - (15:19): should I send the classes ?  \nsburjan - (15:20): it's one new class, and 2 existing and modified ones  \ncjdelisle - (15:20): can you send a patch?  \ncjdelisle - (15:21): err I mean create an issue and attach the patch ;)  \nsburjan - (15:21): you mean a diff patch ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:21): svn diff?  \nsburjan - (15:22): well the issue is reported by silviar and it was already fixed, now I come with the test so it won't appear again  \nsburjan - (15:22): should I attach the classes to the JIRA issue ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:23): It's a bit of a judgment call but I would attach the patch to the closed issue. Maybe someone else will correct me on that.  \nsburjan - (15:25): this test was requested by sdumitriu ...  \nztane - (15:32): hi, pygments highlighting seems to be able to crash tomcat+openjdk with 85% certainty on some pages ...  \nztane - (15:32): :)  \nztane - (15:32): anyone know, if i could test other jython versions  \nztane - (15:32): like 2.5.2b2?  \nztane - (15:34): that is, if modifications have been made to xwiki jython  \ncjdelisle - (15:35): Is it an out of memory error (permgen space)?  \nztane - (15:37): no, Current CompileTask:  \nztane - (15:37): C2:4264 \u00a0! \u00a0\u00a0pygments.lexer$py.get\\_tokens\\_unprocessed$37(Lorg/python/core/PyFrame;Lorg/python/core/ThreadState;)Lorg/python/core/PyObject; (1800 bytes)  \nztane - (15:37): always happens there, i suspect, it is invalid bytecode  \ncjdelisle - (15:39): Never seen that before, what's your java vender and what language is the code in the macro?  \nztane - (15:40): # Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (14.0-b08 mixed mode linux-amd64 )  \nztane - (15:40): # Distribution: Ubuntu 9.04, package 6b14-1.4.1-0ubuntu13  \ntmortagne - (15:40): ( ztane: did not seen b2 was out, thanks for the warning, i'm upgrading ;) )  \nztane - (15:40): :)  \ntmortagne - (15:42): ztane: would you be able to try with sun jre ?  \nztane - (15:42): maybe :)  \ncjdelisle - (15:42): I'm running OpenJDK and havn't seen any trouble.  \ncjdelisle - (15:43): 32bit.
