As soon as you start scrolling more and more nodes will be requested starting from a given index  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:10): fmancinelli I think, we could also modify xmlrpc to limit the no of results/pages returned.  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:10): vnkatesh: yes, that's necessary to implement that on the server side  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:11): vnkatesh: but also on the client side we should understand if VIRTUAL + Deferred content manager + Common Navigator could work together :)   \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:11): vnkatesh: I am not sure about this  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:11): vnkatesh: a priori it should  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:11): fmancinelli that is possible? events based on scrolling...?  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:12): fmancinelli that is, based on if it has reached at one particular lower level?  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:12): fmancinelli ok, I will see to it. :)  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:13): fmancinelli I have actually worked on this, to limit xmlrpc  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:13): XECLIPSE-106  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:13): XWIKI-1559  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:14): vnkatesh: for the VIRTUAL you can look at ILazyContentProvider (which seems to be implemented by DeferredContentProvider, so things should be possible)  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:16): fmancinelli: okay, just saw the doc, seems workable, will have to look more into it.  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:19): vnkatesh: on the xmlrpc api side we might add some additional getSpaces and getPages methods having two additional parameters (start, number) in order to request only a subset of the available spaces/pages  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:20): yes, that will be done.  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:21): vnkatesh: though this could be a problem for backward compatibility...  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:22): fmancinelli yes, but I've noticed, a \"Functionality\" element  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:22): fmancinelli which gets the server major/minor version  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:22): vnkatesh: yes  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:22): fmancinelli that can be used here too.  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:24): vnkatesh: we should discriminate the xmlrpc calls wrt the version. if we are on a new version we use getPages(start, number) otherwise we use the old one  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:24): vnkatesh: so that we stay compatible with older versions  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:25): fmancinelli yes, that is what Functionality does.  \ntachirei - (27/05/2009 15:25): mflorea: If I edit a page with wiki editor (XWiki 2.0 syntax), is it possible to edit it with WYSIWYG editor later? cause it doesn't work for me...  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:25): vnkatesh: ah right :) I misunderstood your previous sentence... You were actually talking about the Functionality class :)  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:25): vnkatesh: ok  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:26): fmancinelli :)  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:27): vnkatesh: ok I adding this aspect to the gsoc page because it's important for the user experience  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:27): Ok, or should I do it?  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:28): vnkatesh: I can't :) So you should do it :)  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:28): fmancinelli: sure :)  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:30): vnkatesh: another thing you should be aware of is the notification mechanism  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:30): vnkatesh: maybe you have already noticed it  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:30): fmancinelli: no, I have not.  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:31): fmancinelli: notification as in?  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:32): vnkatesh: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/xeclipse/trunk/plugins/org.xwiki.eclipse.core/src/main/java/org/xwiki/eclipse/core/notifications/  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:32): vnkatesh: these are events fired in different situations  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:33): vnkatesh: UI elements (and also the navigator) track these event in order to refresh their state and present an up-to-date visualization of the UI  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:33): fmancinelli ok.  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:34): vnkatesh: for example refreshing a tree node representing a page after that the page has been opened so that the icon reflects the fact tha the page has also been cached  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:34): fmancinelli does this also handle changes at the server side?  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:35): vnkatesh: no  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:35): fmancinelli say, if somebody deletes a page, no notification to the navigator, correct?  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:36): fmancinelli \\*some other user deletes the page, from some other location  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:38): fmancinelli so, is there any change that I need to bring upon this notification mechanism?, or you just wanted to me to know that such a thing exists? :)  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:38): vnkatesh: if somebody removes a page, an event PAGE\\_REMOVED is fired by the DataManager and every listener will handle this event. In particular, the navigator will refresh the space in order to remove the deleted page from the tree  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:39): vnkatesh: Just wanted to make you know how this mechanism exist :)  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:39): vnkatesh: because you will almost surely need to use/extend it  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:39): fmancinelli: ok.  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:41): vnkatesh: concerning the next steps I would say that you start with a simple thing i.e., adding the logic to display attachments and languages in the tree.   \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:42): fmancinelli yes, even I wanted to do something simple to boost myself..  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:43): vnkatesh: this step will make you look at the internals of the CNF  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:43): vnkatesh: and also the platform internals (like adapters and so on)  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:44): vnkatesh: hint: you will have to work a lot with plugin.xml  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:44): fmancinelli yes, I noticed that plugin.xml had a big role here.  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:45): vnkatesh: I am going to send you some additional documentation about CNF so things will be more clear (give me some time to find it in my backups)  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:46): fmancinelli thanks, that would be useful.  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:47): vnkatesh: I would propose a 10 days deadline for this task, so we should have this functionality ready by the 5th of june if it's ok for you  \njk\\_work joined #xwiki at 15:47  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:47): vnkatesh: they should be enough (of course you can ping me as soon as you have a problem or a blocking question)  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:48): fmancinelli for understanding cnf and attachments ?  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:48): fmancinelli \\*and adding attachements feature?  \nvnkatesh - (27/05/2009 15:48): fmancinelli that is good enough :)  \nfmancinelli - (27/05/2009 15:50): vnkatesh: well, let's try for the 5th of June.
