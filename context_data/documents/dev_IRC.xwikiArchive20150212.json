I cannot reproduce it, but the reason is that I might miss some special space name  \n16:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think the problem has to do with the \u00a0documentTree macro itself, not the content in the panel ... one moment, checking something  \n16:05\u00a0<alex000>\u00a0oh, it is because I've special space names on my side ?  \n16:05\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:05\u00a0<alex000>\u00a0ok I wait \u00a0:)  \n16:06\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:06\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, likely \"special space names\", which of course should not be a problem ... some escaping missing in the macro I think  \n16:07\u00a0<alex000>\u00a0ok, do you think it can be fixed in the next update ?  \n16:07\u00a0<alex000>\u00a0because the navigation panel is very important for us...  \n16:09\u00a0<alex000>\u00a0I confess that I was about to give up XWiki, 'cause we've just stabilized our installation...  \n16:10\u00a0<alex000>\u00a0we encountered a lot of problems in the installation and configuration  \n16:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, I cannot reproduce it, looks like all is properly escaped in the macro. on the other hand if you get something like \u00a0\u00a0links=\"$links\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0then something really went wrong  \n16:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you are logged in as Admin can you go to the /xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/DocumentTree and check if the page looks ok, and has programming rights (just in case)  \n16:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if yes, then in the object editor: does this have a \" WikiMacroParameterClass 12: links \" or the like ?  \n16:16\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:17\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0alex000: \u00a0ah, and I remember you said you upgraded the wiki ... from which version was the upgrade?
