Having an EventListener to listen on UpdatedDocument can reveal them  \n11:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0at least this is how I did, discovered it by accident  \n11:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0bbl, lunch  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: search should be OK now  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: are you looking into the mandatory classes updates at startup or do you want me to have a look?  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking quickly  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR initializeMandatoryClasses is working fine  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing XWiki.WatchListJobClass

\n12:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: for what I can see all the initializer using AbstractMandatoryDocumentInitializer#setClassDocumentFields have the issue  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't see that  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but maybe  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I know for sure  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that WatchListJobManager has an issue  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in setWatchListCommonDocumentsFields  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well not that code directly  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it checks for author ref  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and since it's null it sets needsUpsate to true  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking DB now  \n12:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the exact same issue in AbstractMandatoryDocumentInitializer#setClassDocumentFields

\n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but now we return null  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not the same for mandatory classes  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0document.getCreatorReference() is not guest  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm pretty confident the issue is that we reutrn null now for guest user

\n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we set the document author with the creator reference  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but I've stopped my wiki  \n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and the creator reference is supperadmin  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and checked the db  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's guest in there  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not superadmin  \n12:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe for watchlist  \n12:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again I 'm talking about AbstractMandatoryDocumentInitializer here  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check what it saves  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm just looking at watcjhlist ATM  \n12:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I just looked at wtahclist and it's doing the same thing, setting the creator  \n12:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is superdamin  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n12:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so no it's not as simple as you saif  \n12:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0said  \n12:26\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm checking why it doesn't save correctly  \n12:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it should no be null  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0In the DB it's guest  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's normal that we get null  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's not normal  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is why superadmin is not used in the saved doc  \n12:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes this is why I keep telling you, is not because we use null for guess that we have the issue...  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it's also because of that  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because before  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we had not null  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when guest was used  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which means it didn't resave the docs at startup  \n12:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it still did not had the right author...  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found

\n12:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is not hibernate storage job...  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so 4.4.RC1  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we could keep it  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but only if

\n12:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO this has nothing to do in hibernate storage  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think he fixed it in the wrong place indeed  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you fixing it?  \n12:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which mean ? reverting his commit ?  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reverting is not enough  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we also need to fix XWIKI-8240  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie set the author before calling the store  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie in rename() I think  \n12:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0probably

at it  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0creating a jira issue first  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same for backlinks docs below I think  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0XWikiDocument backlinkDocument = xwiki.getDocument(backlinkDocumentReference, context);  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0backlinkDocument.setAuthorReference(...)  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: checking jira, I think someone created some jiras about this recently...  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or maybe I dreamt it)  \n12:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't remember it or it was very indirect side effect maybe  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9010#  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could be related maybe  \n12:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right, that one  \n12:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's possible  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the affects orrespond at least  \n12:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at leas that's true for some of the listed classes  \n12:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but some of them could have a different cause since they are not all mandatory classes  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep but save will do that  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if there's no context user  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or guest)  \n12:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's possible some of these are really setting guest as author  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's more like we have some daemon threads not setting the author correctly  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why daemon thread ?  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm pretty sure it's at startup that's all  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because for the main thread we set the author  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes startup is possible  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's done before we set the current author in the contetx  \n12:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm pretty sure all that is node before we set the current user  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it really means we have some code not setting the author as it should  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be good to have some warning in XHS  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when we save the doc  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the author is null  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to find places where it's not set correctly)  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/XHS/XWHS/  \n12:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not sure I understand, it's very possible this issue is all about XWIKI-8240 and having guest as author is not really an error  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a08240 is only about renae  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rename  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but more generally we can have problems if save doc is called and the author is not set  \n12:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-8240. is about forcing the saved document author to be the one in the context  \n12:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which mean guest in most of theses classes cases  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me 8240 was about what we deiscussed  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie make the change in rename()  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie set the author there  \n12:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I'm talking about what XWIKI-8240 introduced  \n12:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the cause of the issue we are talking about  \n12:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is not that some code set the wrong author  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a08240 is fixed easily by changing rename()  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and revert what sergiu has done)  \n12:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I know  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now that doesn't ensure  \n12:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again I talking about what sdmitriu did  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that all calls to saveDoc will have the author set correctly  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could have some daemon thread or some init code that doesn't set the author  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and setting guest is wrong IMO  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only for those cases though  \n12:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but as I told you it's not an error to have guest being the author of a document  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be valid in other cases  \n12:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n12:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just give guest edit right  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the conetxt author is not set and author is guest maybe?  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I guess we can't know that now  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:(  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we use null  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for both not set and guest  \n12:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not set is guest  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why it's a anti pattern btw  \n12:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a difference between not set (ie bug) and set to guest voluntarily  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example imagine that the scheduler job was not setting the author  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would make changes as guest  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which wouldn't be correct  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm trying to find a way to find out these kind of issues  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but doesn't look easy....  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: fyi webstandards is fixed :)  \n12:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a09 jobs left to fix\u2026. :(  \n12:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0only 2  \n12:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02?  \n12:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, for master

\n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not but it's bad to have stable 5.x branch failing  \n13:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sure  \n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even worse than having master fialing  \n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm i don't get it, I've logged on a11 and built the ldap test module and it builds fine...  \n13:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway...

don't really need to wait, you can apply it yourself pretty easily since that's SOLR configuration actually  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: in data you have a solr folder  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0apply https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/18b321aaa300b25379b2ad81ba78d07adaa8de77 to conf/schema.xml file  \n15:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thanks

 \n16:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, now I have it !  \n16:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise you are searching an empty index  \n16:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0after re-saving  \n16:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so right now you don't find most of the default pages because they don't have language set which sounds pretty wrong to me but I need to update the UI to not search only in the current language it need to also inherit the default language  \n16:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, that was my next questions, why I can't find pages in default packages :)  \n16:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0just wanted to make sure you are aware of it  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was not aware that so many pages did not had any language set  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so looks like I will need to modify the UI sooner than I tough  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lets see  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually I can support that in a safer way on java side probably  \n16:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I imagined that all the pages from the default packages have language set, etc...  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I tough too...  \n16:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's probably not all pages since it does not seems to be removed by the xar plugin format goal (just tested)  \n16:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe this is how export work when multilanguage is not set  \n16:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n16:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nop that's not it either  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha actually it is removed by xar plugin, was not looking at the right file  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it removes the <defaultLanguage> property and the laguage one is not set for the default document  \n16:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so it's a bug in the packager plugin ?
