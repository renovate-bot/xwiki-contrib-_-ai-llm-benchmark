I made a change to attachment saving. Investigating...  \ncjdelisle - (12:04): Thanks for pointing it out.  \nevalica - (12:04): I have now for some attachments on a page version 1.111  \nevalica - (12:05): and I can't save the page anymore because I get a NullPointerException  \nevalica - (12:05): for saveAttachmentContent  \nevalica - (12:05): thanks for looking ... so I have to work on a different snapshot :P  \ncjdelisle - (12:06): Sorry about that. The patch was fixing the fact that attachments absolutely didn't work via xmlrpc or document.addAttachment.  \nlucaa left at 12:28 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa1 joined #xwiki at 12:28  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 12:29  \nevalica left at 12:32 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nEnygma` left at 12:33 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nvenkatesh left at 12:33 (Client Quit  \nlucaa1 left at 12:33 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nmflorea left at 12:45 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 12:47  \nsilviar left at 12:48 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa left at 13:13 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 13:53  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 14:00  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 14:02  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 14:02  \nvenkatna joined #xwiki at 14:08  \nvenkatna left at 14:09 (Remote host closed the connection  \nvenkatesh left at 14:09 (Remote host closed the connection  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 14:09  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 14:17  \nevalica left at 14:23 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 14:28  \nevalica left at 14:32 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 14:32  \nevalica1 joined #xwiki at 14:34  \nevalica2 joined #xwiki at 14:37  \nevalica left at 14:37 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nevalica1 left at 14:40 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 14:45  \nevalica1 joined #xwiki at 14:47  \nevalica2 left at 14:48 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nevalica left at 14:50 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nevalica1 left at 14:54 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 15:01  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 15:02  \nxipe\\_ left at 15:06 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nxipe joined #xwiki at 15:15  \ncjdelisle - (15:17): Found the bug. doc.getDocument().getAttachmentList().get(0).isContentDirty() always returns true.

If it's a bug that people have been living with then it seems silly to risk introducing instability to fix it.  \nflorinciu left at 15:46 (Quit: Leaving.  \nabusenius - (15:47): well, srid stopped working in 2.4  \nabusenius - (15:47): (partially)  \ncjdelisle - (15:47): srid?  \nabusenius - (15:47): restoring the request when you were logged out  \ncjdelisle - (15:48): What's the effect?  \ncjdelisle - (15:49): You always end up on the main page after logging in/out?  \nabusenius - (15:49): well, if you were editing something and hit save when your session expired, you are redirected to login  \nabusenius - (15:49): and your data is lost  \nabusenius - (15:49): no  \nabusenius - (15:50): I mean if you close the browser and your cookies are deleted or something  \ncjdelisle - (15:50): Hmm. Maybe something to discuss on the list. Sounds serious. How dangerous is the patch?  \nabusenius - (15:50): it adds srid to the xredirect url, shouldn'T break anything  \nabusenius - (15:51): sergiu should know more, he wrote it afaik  \ncjdelisle - (15:52): Srid is something I really know nothing about.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 15:54  \ncjdelisle - (15:59): I'd like to propose deprecating the old query plugin.
