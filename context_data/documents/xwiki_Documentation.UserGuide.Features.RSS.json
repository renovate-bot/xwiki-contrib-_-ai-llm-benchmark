The default wiki (extensions might provide more) provides the following RSS feeds:\n\n* Feed for all modified pages. This is available from the [Notifications Application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/).\n* Feed for all Blog posts. This is available if your wiki has the [Blog application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Blog%20Application) installed.\n* Feeds for Search results. This is available if your wiki has the [Search application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Search%20Application) installed.\n* Feeds on Tags. This is available if your wiki has the [Tag application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Tag%20Application) installed.\n* The [Watchlist Feature](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Watchlist%20Application) allows you to get a RSS feed of all the modifications to the pages in your Watchlist.\n\nNote that you can choose to start receiving information from the Blog and modified pages feeds by using your browser's RSS notification button. For example on Firefox:\n\n![rss.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RSS/rss.png?rev=1.1)\n\n# Customized RSS Feeds\n\nEven more so, it's easy to create new RSS feeds to fit a specific need (or modify existing RSS feeds):\n\n* You can also easily create your own page that outputs RSS (Atom, RDF, etc). Edit the Main.WebRss page in your wiki to see how it's implemented and do the same in your own page.\n* You can also modify the existing RSS pages (e.g. Main.WebRss) if you wish to customize the default RSS content produced by the various applications.\n\n\n"}
