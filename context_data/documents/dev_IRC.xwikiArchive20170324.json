In the design page, I have to add what will I do in my proposed project?  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi sgc072  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0today I'll work on fixing the enterprise build (with its test) to make sure that the Admin user switch to simple + the extraction of the blog app are working fine  \n09:24\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Its like the proposal that I will submit for my GSoC.  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sgc072: not sure  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on design  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not reltaed to you  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's related to the design of the Glossary app  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that's maybe a small difference  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes there's a lot of overlap probably :)  \n09:25\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0oh. I see. Yeah I understood what you mean. :P :D  \n09:25\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Thanks  \n10:00\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0vmassol, Is it alright that only 'admin' will be able to add new items/make changes to the definitions in the glossary application? Or normal users will have the same right as the admin?  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sgc072: I think we should allow everyone to add entries  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since this is the philosophy of the wiki  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we should think about finding ways to restrict that permissions if there's a need  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but by default allow everyone with edit rights to create glossary entries  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could say that if the user has edit permission on the glossary space then he can create entries  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's simple  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so in the in-situ UI, we would check for that permission  \n10:36\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Right. So the users only will review the changes.  \n10:39\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:40\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n10:41\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0if any user make any changes, others will know by flashing messages on IRC or by 'Last Modified' text on the top of every page?  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WDYM?  \n10:42\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Like if a make any change on a page now. What will happen?  \n10:43\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0How will other users know?  \n10:43\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Like it may happen that a user enters wrong information.  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand the problem  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the wiki concept is  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- everyone can make changes  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- it's historized anyway  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- it's possible to rollback if need be  \n10:47\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0the rollback can be done by any user?  \n10:52\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Sorry for such silly questions :p  \n11:00\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sgc072: as long as you have edit right  \n11:04\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Ok, got that.

This action is reversible so I will just do it and assume consent.  \n16:23\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0\\*Matrix homeserver hosted by XWiki SAS  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd (@cdelisle:matrix.xwiki.com): errr wait  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so this just to control the permissions?  \n16:24\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't we loose stuff  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like uptime/maintenance  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n16:25\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0Historically the matrix.org server has had the worst uptime of any homeserver  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what happens to us here on this channel?  \n16:25\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0because it carries half the traffic in the network  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to create new users on the xwiki sas matrix server?  \n16:25\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0no action required but when you leave and rejoin it will look different  \n16:26\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0Being a user on the XWiki SAS matrix server is not required to be in a channel which is rooted on that server.  \n16:27\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0You can join #cryptpad:matrix.org or #cryptpad:matrix.xwiki.com to see a channel which was already just moved  \n16:27\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0both names are aliases to the same channel  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fine with me  \n16:28\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0hmm actually might lose history during the move, it is accessible by joining the old channel but it won't be there by default  \n16:28\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0history or channel-logo? :)  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't care about channel logo  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:29\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0it can be left as it is if you'd prefer but there is no possibility for moderation right now and no logo  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess it dpeends what we want to use matrix for  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now it's used as an irc bridge only  \n16:30\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0That's up to you I guess, for CryptPad we see IRC as a barrier to entry for potential users and contributors and matrix is a prettier solution.  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0matrix is definitely more a barrier than irc since irc s more well known and there are a lot more clients  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I don't mind on my side  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since there are only a few of us here using matrix to bridge to irc  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and for history we have the irc logs on xwiki.org  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne, mflorea1, others: wdyt?  \n16:33\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0We give out the matrix riot.im link because it is faster to use from a web browser than installing an irc client  \n16:33\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0and it has history and other features which people expect in a chat  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess we could do the same  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now we have an integrated irc client on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/IRC  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it could be nicer to give the riot.im link  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so again I'm +1 to switch on my side, would like to have tmortagne \u00a0and mflorea1 's opionon before doing it though  \n16:38\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0I can make the channel and then just wait for the alias change  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n16:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:42\u00a0<MatrixBridge>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:42\u00a0<MatrixBridge>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:43\u00a0<MatrixBridge>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:44\u00a0<MatrixBridge>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd (@cdelisle:matrix.xwiki.com): what I don't understand  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is how I'm going to switch server  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basicallt the current channel won't exist anymore  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't you have to change your riot.im configuration to use a different server ?  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basicallt the current channel won't exist anymore on riot.im  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when I reconnect it's still going to find it since you'd use the same channel name  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but located on the xwiki sas server  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when you drop this channel on riot.im  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then suddently it won't work anytmore  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and all I'll need to do is close my client and restart it  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n16:45\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0no, nothing changes  \n16:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0test  \n16:45\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0it's this weird federation stuff  \n16:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so there's a channel name  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the central server tells my client where the chanel is located (ie on which server)  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some autodiscovery stuff  \n16:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0test2  \n16:53\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0ok, at this moment the channel we are in right now is #freenode\\_#xwiki:matrix.org but it has an alias (#xwiki:matrix.org) \u00a0you can also join #xwiki:matrix.xwiki.com and that channel is also bridged with the same IRC channel. \u00a0If you're happy to move (and yes, lose history) then all we need to do is move the alias #xwiki:matrix.org to that channel and the move is complete.  \n16:53\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0ok, technical difficulties at matrix.org, their IRC bridge is lagging very badly  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so now I'm on the new xwiki sas matrix channel that's bridged to xwiki.org IRC on freenode  \n16:55\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0yes but the bridge is in very bad shape at the moment, messages are not getting through to irc for ~minutes  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm not working well  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I joined the new channel and I typed a message and it's hanging  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0test again from xwiki sas channel  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok working now  \n16:56\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0ordinarily you would see your own messages from the other channel reflected through IRC  \n16:57\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0has quit  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hello  \n16:58\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0here we go... it's starting to sync  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually not working  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought I was typing in the other chnnale but i wasn''t; )  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought I was typing in the other chnnale but i wasn't ;)  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n16:59\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0Anyway we can revisit this next week after they have time to fix their infrastructure  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still not seeing what I type right away...  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR this was sent several minutes ago...  \n17:01\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0yeah, maybe their stuff is syncing now, anyway matrix.org server is in a bad state, and it is affecting this channel already even without the new one.  \n17:17\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0everything seems to be working again now  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still spinning for me cjd (@cdelisle:matrix.xwiki.com)  \n17:33\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0spinning ?

I am concluding that the idea of running several domains with one instance of xwiki is not viable, which is what I assumed it was desinged to do.  \n23:05\u00a0<keithy>\u00a0only one domain (the wrong one) gets the blog  \n23:41\u00a0<keithy>\u00a0ah ha! I found an install blog on the \u201cfarm\u201d so now each one gets a blog!  \n23:41\u00a0<keithy>\u00a0hmm\n"}
