Well, Wiki Manager API 5.1 was installed as a dependency of Wiki Manager Application 5.1. Now Wiki Manager API 5.2 is a core dependency, bundled with XE, so the upgrade of Wiki Manager Application 5.2 left Wiki Manager API 5.1 unused. You should uninstall it.  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I should uninstall 5.1 and reinstall 5.2?  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for wiki manager api)  \n14:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no, just uninstall Wiki Manager API 5.1. You cannot install/uninstall 5.2 version because it is a core extension. You cannot touch it.  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes indeed  \n14:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0The general case is this: you install a jar, which in the next verison of XE becomes a core extension, i.e. we bundle it with XE  \n14:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the previous version becomes invalid, and should be uninstalled  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep got it  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure all users will get it but I understand  \n14:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed..  \n14:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yep wikimanager api is invalid here because a core extension already exist  \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that it's just an information (it's not loaded since it's invalid)  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:41\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0just rebuilt XE from sources again and I still get https://gist.github.com/vmassol/7040991 when I use it  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0am I the only one?  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there doesn't seem to be a problem on ci  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0removing my local repo and rebuilidng enterprise  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this class is supposed to come from validation-api-1.1.0.Final.jar  \n14:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(javax.validation.ParameterNameProvider)  \n14:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and this is a dependency of xwiki-properties  \n14:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki-commons-properties  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't force it in the commons root pom so maybe you have a conflict between several dependencies and end up with the wrong version  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok it works now  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after removing my local repo and rebuilding xe  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway we should maybe put it in the root pom like other standard libraries to be extra safe  \n14:55\u00a0<Slash\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:55\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:56\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: hi, do you agree that http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XEM-208 can be solved by the signed script proposal?  \n15:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: not sure to get the point  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he wants to be able to use PR on his wubwiki AFAIU  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*subwiki  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW what's the jira issue for signed scripts?  \n15:01\u00a0<Slash\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0see the roadmap  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok you updated it cool  \n15:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I will update further, trying to create sub tasks  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I don't like subtasks  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd perfer several top level tasks  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as otherwise you'll not be able to close the top level one and it'll be empty with no commits  \n15:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yep, I means cut the problem in independant pieces  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good  \n15:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0just have taken the one thomas d created and make public for now  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep seen the public part  \n15:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but, I see it as a too big new feature to hold everythings  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes probably  \n15:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0moreover, I have reviewed the code from Thomas, and I am really unhappy of the implementation  \n15:05\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I still do no understand what XEM-208 means  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: nm, I've closed it, we'll see if he replies  \n15:10\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:13\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:32\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:36\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n15:38\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:40\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:21\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:07\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0Hello. Could anybody remind me how to pass a real list of strings, from a page to another within the request?  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean what is the syntax in a URL ?  \n17:08\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0If I send a true list within the queryString, it can only be received as a string on the other page. A string that look like a list ([...,...,...])  \n17:08\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I don't really know.. ways to do that  \n17:08\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I'm validating a page with a form, I'd like to send a list I generated ealier in the page  \n17:08\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0but no way to make it work  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you want to pass a list of things in a URL you do it the following way: http://toto?list=element1&list=element2  \n17:09\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0hmm.. but that works only if I use html blocks of the same \"name\", right? Because at the moment, I have a XWiki list, so... could I strip it to send it?  \n17:10\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I know I did what you're suggesting before, with a table with several fields. But now, I'm trying to put send it via a \"hidden\" type field  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0GuillaumeF: see also http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/SavingData  \n17:11\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0because the data I want to send is not related to the form, but the page itself  \n17:11\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0ok thanks!  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually we need to update this page with request, xcontext  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/SavingData won't help as far as I can see  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah xcontext is mentioned  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0GuillaumeF does not want to save a list  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only thing missing is passing data in the URL  \n17:14\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0or maybe adding some objects to the context and retrieving it from the next page? (total newbie in xwiki context)  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0GuillaumeF: so you don't want to generate a query string but you want to use a hidden html form input ?  \n17:15\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I'm open to all ideas :D queryString would be ok, that's what I tried, but I failed because the list I send, is retrieved as a string on the other page.  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the same way you repeat the field in the URL you can repeat the input element in the html  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as in:  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"myHidden\" value=\"1\"> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"myHidden\" value=\"2\"> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"myHidden\" value=\"3\">  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I can't answer for you  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I need to know your situation  \n17:16\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0so you suggest I put a input in a foreach? that would work, indeed  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you in a form ?  \n17:16\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0yep  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so then yes generate the input elements in a foreach  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's probably the easiest  \n17:16\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0great, haven't even thought about it  \n17:17\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0thank you  \n17:17\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0(ftr, target is glimpse wiki, so internal needs)  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: ping  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why are you removing labels?  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8729  \n17:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0evalica: same here, those labels are important informations  \n17:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well since now we are gonna use labels for roadmap items - I was trying to clean them somehow and remove labels that are single, duplicate the title or description  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0using a defined list of labels to filter some issues does not imply you have to remove all the other labels...  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're loosing data here  \n17:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0labels are tags and I'm -1 to have a hard defined list of valid labels, anyone should be able to put any labels he want to categorize issues  \n17:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well if the information is already somehow in the title or description and is not a 'common' label with what it helps you to search/refine the data?  \n17:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again I'm -1 to say there is a defined list of valid labels  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not something we should conrol  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*control  \n17:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0searching for jython related issue using the label is important, the fact that there is only one right now does not make it invalid label  \n17:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0except XWIKI-8729 is any other issue you thing it should have it's label back?  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't checked all you removed  \n17:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0evalica: it's impossible that we ever have another issue about jython ?  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0next time might be better to ask :)  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a lot of work for you to put back all labels you removed  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and again I don't care there is only one issue at a given time for which the label make sense  \n17:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0no there is not - since I didn't removed much, but I won't put them back, because some were not supposed to be there  \n17:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no such thing as invalid labels except a label that does not have anything to do with the issue  \n17:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I consider it to be cleanup work somehow  \n17:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0...  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you sure cleaned up :)  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but too much  \n17:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:16\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n19:28\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:38\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:40\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
