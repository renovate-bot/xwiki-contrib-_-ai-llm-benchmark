The unicode characters are correctly displayed. I can't open though the rtf file exported when I'm not connected to OO server.

MW is itself a defacto standard.  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you're talking about enterprise or general public  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for enterprise wiki I don't think so  \n10:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0xwiki is the most standard of all .. with what/who \u00a0you make this comparation ?  \n10:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I agree there.  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: because it supports all syntaxes :)  \n10:16\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0oh  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0including creole which is the standard effort  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not all but quite a lot: about 6-7)  \n10:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0IMO a standard is doomed unless the Wikipedia people are on board and that means it's some extension of MW.  \n10:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But these things always happen, it's just (IMO) a question of when the time is right.  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0implementations of creole: http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Engines  \n10:18\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0from what I see these days, Wikipedia has financial issues .. I'm sure standardizing a syntax is not a top priority for them  \n10:19\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0updating http://wiki.wikicreole.org/Engines  \n10:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Hmm no mention of MW. They are the 800lb gorilla. Without them a standard isn't likely to go far.  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's already up to date, someone added xwiki cool :)  \n10:19\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: there's another way: merge wikimodel/xwiki rendering and Eclipse's wikitext  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(jason van zyl proposed to put us in contact to do this merge - I'm waiting for thomasM to be back to start a discussion about it)  \n10:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That's interesting.  \n10:23\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0question is if a standard is even necessary for wiki syntax because it's basically just a dialect of HTML, since all the markup will be changed to HTML at some point  \n10:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you know MW syntax, that doesn't translate to knowing XWiki syntax or FosWiki.  \n10:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0And everyone supports a set of converters of one type or another so pages can be imported.  \n10:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true. nevertheless do i think if it's just a dialect it needs to be flexible to fit the developers needs for change at all times  \n10:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so no standards and every software sticks to what they think is best to have a nicely working piece of software  \n10:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0especially for corporate software...  \n10:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0There is a long history of software developers locking their customers in to a given standard.  \n10:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0if you just check out CAD software you'll notice that the many attempts to create file types supported across platforms eventually failed to be up to the job  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: well xwiki is not doing that I think  \n10:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hold on  \n10:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0No, I don't think there is any mallice in the wiki market. Just inefficency.  \n10:30\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: best way to to all ui-tests and see which fail due to Selenium2b1 migrations would be to run them from console, not eclipse, right ?  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: pb is that for ex xwiki's syntax goes way beyond most other wiki syntaxes  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why XWiki Syntax 2.0 is not exactly Creole BTW  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's Creole + more  \n10:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Ahh I see.  \n10:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So there was a standard that was followed. It just was not a fruitful standard.  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: you can start with eclipse but console is the definitive answer indeed  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: you can say that but it's tricky  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since several syntaes voluntarily don't go too far to not make the syntax too complex  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and deciding up to where to push it depends on one's judgment....  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some do wiki syntax + HTML for more complex stuff  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I think mediawiki does that to some extent)  \n10:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes. that and \"pseudo html\"  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.wikimatrix.org/compare/MediaWiki+XWiki  \n10:33\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i get a tons of failures in eclipse when running the whole project, but then I select packages individually and run them, they pass .. I get something like : org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connection to http://127.0.0.1:7055 refused  \n10:34\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and I've never seen this before. So something happens when I run the whole project  \n10:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0MW is a bit like Windows. It has the power to write defacto standards simply by the sheer number of installations and it (apparently) has no interest in working with anyone else.  \n10:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true but like i said, i don't there really is a need for a hard standard.  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: I don't think there's a need either and i don't think there'll ever be one  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw cjdelisle look at programming languages  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there isn't a standard  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it doesn't always end up with a standard  \n10:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Hah nope. There are a lot of them.  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my only question is whether wiki syntax is going to survive in the end or not  \n10:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But at least Sun java == IBM Java and GNU C ~= Borland C  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0atlassian thinks it won't and several other wikis are using HTML as their syntax too  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well all wiki syntaxes are close too ;)  \n10:40\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0vmassol: there is. at least for C and i think C++  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: and cobol and java and python and ruby and php and all others....  \n10:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0difference is that the interpreters/compilers usually don't all do the same  \n10:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so there are few compilers that stick to the standard  \n10:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But to the credit of the programming language people, they do write books with the standard and there end up being multiple implementations.  \n10:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0which is why basically i don't think a standard for wiki syntax is necessary... the interpreter will always do it a little different anyway  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the best way to have a standard impl is by making it open source :)  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so people reuse it instead of rewriting it  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0vmassol: not even then, IMO.  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it's all about concepts, ideas and needs  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0if they want to achieve something special they'll write it a little different  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0or make a fork or something  \n10:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The question over whether wiki syntax will live on is interesting.  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0whatever syntax is featured in a software that lives on  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think that is about the best answer there is  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah and I'm curious about the answer since we've invested a lot in it  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(wiki syntax)  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we = xwiki dev team  \n10:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and a great job you did  \n10:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I tend to think yes because it is old. It was bb code and blog syntax.  \n10:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, even bb code lives on, doesn't it?  \n10:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Usually the goal of a syntax is to prevent people saying <script>  \n10:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0despite it being more painful to use than wiki syntax  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0brb  \n10:46\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0^^  \n10:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Writing plain html has the advantage that it is indeed a standardized syntax. Not easy to write though.  \n10:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0exactly  \n10:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: which way is the bet way to run tests from maven ? mvn surefire:tests ?  \n10:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but even with the standardized HTML you see all kinds of browsers screwing up... even the OpenSource ones  \n10:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0because I am not able to run them, don't know why  \n10:48\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0btw, this is why i prefere Opera... because they actually stick to the standard  \n10:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yes, implementations of html (and worse javascript) wander from the standard.  \n10:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Opera lol. It's a good js validator.  \n10:49\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0?  \n10:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Broken js will \"work\" in FF but in Opera it will fail.  \n10:49\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0see! ;)  \n10:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But if the browser people rejected all invalid html then most of the web would be inaccessable.  \n10:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but that would also keep a lot of shitty websites from being available... most of them coded by 14yr old /b/ members for the sake of trolling, insulting and generally being a nuisance  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: mvn test  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are some help tipcs here too: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Testing  \n10:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0jstoldt: thought you might get a kick out of this being an engineer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg7hxaPAjnw  \n10:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0implementation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX27qvPlHsI  \n11:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, one of those vertical wind mills...  \n11:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, those are really neat from a technical POV.... where i come from we got shit load of those regular ones  \n11:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0By rotating the vanes, the power extraction increases, friction decreases and you can use simple wind load calculations to figure power output.  \n11:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah. it's a very nice concept  \n11:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0just like tide turbines  \n11:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Also you have a means to kill it by knocking off the timing or by allowing one vaine to rotate 90 degrees out of allignment you can let all of the air strait through.  \n11:04\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true... might be benefitial on high wind speed... the regular ones need to be shutdown when too much wind blows...  \n11:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yup. Lotta problems.  \n11:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*and it can run slow and still extract a lot of power. Basic wind load calculations tell just how much.  \n11:05\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, for me personally the best concept for renewable energy is desertec  \n11:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0How exactly does it work?  \n11:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Photo voltaic?  \n11:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0not at all  \n11:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hold on a minute  \n11:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that's the beauty  \n11:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the basic idea is to have parabolic mirrors that mirror the light onto a pipe which contains some sort of oil  \n11:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the oil will be heated and transfer its energy onto water which will boil in order to produce steam  \n11:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the steam will then be treated like in any other given turbine power station  \n11:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and there you go with nice, clean and efficient energy  \n11:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Sounds feasable (more so than PV). Trouble is you need to carry that power a long way.  \n11:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0much unlike photo voltaic which has an efficiency degree of \"don't bother\"  \n11:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0heh  \n11:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, thing about desertec is that they don't aim at the european market in the first place  \n11:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0first priority is to provide the local northern american and spanish markerts  \n11:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0\\*markets  \n11:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you're in the big electricity biz, it sounds sensable enough.  \n11:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Windmills can be used by everyone.  \n11:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anyway, for all i read the capabilities of transfering power via DC got improved a lot so it's only a matter of money to build up the grid  \n11:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, energy is way overprized these days  \n11:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Inverter technology is a pain though, constantly exploding when there's a lightning storm.  \n11:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0prolly gonna be the next bubble to burst... but i should doubt it, though  \n11:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that's why you got great minds becoming engineers... messing with nature to the point even a thunderstorm is no more than a moskito bite to the power grid ;)  \n11:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I studied the feasability of parallel generation. It can be done, need to get specific permission from the power company though.  \n11:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what do you mean by that?  \n11:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0parallel?
