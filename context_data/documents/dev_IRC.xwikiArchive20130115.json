 \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: with a script you can request any repository but the current import UI does not support it  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm wait  \n14:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If it's just the UI then I'll look at improving it so that I can shorten the instructions list for making an extension  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the real API allows it but the repository scipt service only take the repository id  \n14:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so in other words you cpan do it in groovy but not velocity  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/cpan/can/  \n14:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Ahh so we can do it pretty easily for xwiki.org  \n14:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n14:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0can do it in groovy for now and add official support for it in the script service on github  \n14:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think the best way is to have new extension contributers use mvn deploy into a directory and then gut push that to github.  \n14:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for when we upgrade xwiki.org  \n14:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*git  \n14:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Asking a contributer to request permission to deploy on nexus is a nonstarter IMO  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we could do what is done for maven central, your user is associated to some group id and automatically promoted  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you ask only the first time  \n14:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'd rather if people didn't have to ask at all because the major learning curve and the biggest risk of someone walking away is during that first critical extension.  \n14:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0once they can do one, they have mastered it  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well then I'm not sure what you propose ? anyone can deploy anything ?  \n14:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Deploy to a local directory and then push to your own github repo, since github has a \"raw\" mode, you can point maven at a github repo and it will work.  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you would have to have your own maven repository to import an extension ?  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(whatever the way you do your maven repository)  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you're aware that you can use your local maven repo to try your extension right?  \n14:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: you mean by adding it to your xwiki.properties ? \u00a0I was not aware of it but that's good.  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I do that all the time when testing extensions  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: that's because the local maven repository is a valid maven repository  \n14:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0https://github.com/cjdelisle/my-first-xwiki-extension/blob/master/pom.xml#L67 <-- this is what I'm trying at the moment, it makes for a very short instructions list for publishing  \n14:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's just that we need to allow 1 repository per extension  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01 repo per extension is really bad for perf  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbiab  \n15:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a01 repo per extension shouldn't have to be bad performance, maven protocol does require asking every repository for every artifact but it seems that the EM could be more intelligent.  \n15:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0The problem as I see it is people are going to be asking \"why can't it be fast \\*and\\* easy like node.js and golang\" and \"those languages are toys they are not enterprise\" may be true now but it won't be forever.  \n15:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: could you look at the failing UIExtension test?

since 4.0 you can simply do http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting#HSharevariablebetweenlanguages  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(works on groovy -> velocity way right now and not the other way yet)  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0before 4.0 going trough xcontext should work AFAIK  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0groovy:  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0velocity:  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0$xcontext.somevar  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0qwebirc17204: its put() actually, not set()  \n16:41\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:44\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0tmortagne: thank you  \n16:44\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0if I call anotherDoc.getRenderedContent(\"\\$context.somevalue\", \"xwiki/1.0\");  \n16:44\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0where some value is a Document  \n16:44\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0it should produce the tostring representation correct?  \n16:45\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0(with the object in context indeed)  \n16:45\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:45\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0But it pruces \"$context.somevalue\" for me  \n16:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's possible anotherDoc.getRenderedContent is creating a new context I think and is executed in an isolated way  \n16:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so they don't share the same xcontext instance  \n16:53\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0yes that would be a reason, but how to pass \"parameters\" in such a case? Avoid foreign rendering?  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can probably directly use the xwiki/1.0 rendering framework from groovy instead of going through getRenderedContent unless this was just an example  \n16:56\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:58\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0Hey, how to obtain a converter from componentManager in version 3.5?  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cm.lookup(...)  \n18:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:46\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:06\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:35\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:39\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n20:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:32\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0vmassol: Any more feedback on http://markmail.org/message/bfkzhbiteghihf4n ?  \n20:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:23\u00a0<qwebirc17204>\u00a0has quit  \n23:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:57\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
