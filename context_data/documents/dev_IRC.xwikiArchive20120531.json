 \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're not breakages  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the point :)  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in some future we could separate the section in 2  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0f(or people who don't use the legacy modules)  \n12:41\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ok  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case what I mean is that we need a section for people to see breakages when they're using the legacy modules  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is the most important one ATM  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other one is kinda optional but you can also have it if you want (nice to have)  \n12:42\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I think methods like this  \n12:42\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ajc$privFieldSet$com\\_xpn\\_xwiki\\_XWikiCompatibilityAspect$com\\_xpn\\_xwiki\\_XWiki$virtualWikiMap()  \n12:42\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0are actually changing  \n12:42\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0but they're secret and undocumented  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you mention this?

 \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I really checked them all  \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand what you mean  \n13:31\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0when you add something to the compatibility aspect, aj adds a secret method to the woven class so it can access things at runtime  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n13:31\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0when something is not needed anymore, it stops adding the secret method  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why is something not needed anymore?  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we remove a method from legacy we create a breakage so that's prefectly normal  \n13:32\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0because another method was moved to the compatibility aspect which makes it able to access what it needs a different way I assume.  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand what yo mean by this  \n13:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what has another method anything to do with an method already in elgacy?  \n13:33\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0hmm also if another public method is added to the class which makes the secret method redundant, it stands to reason that aj would remove it.  \n13:34\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki: Removed field ajc$interField$com\\_xpn\\_xwiki\\_api\\_XWikiCompatibilityAspect$util  \n13:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well if a neutrino interacts with the computer while it builds it'll also cause a problem ::)  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's unlikely to happen  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK there's no reason that what you mention happens  \n13:35\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0this example is likely because aj needed a method of getting util from XWiki, now Util is in the aspect so it nolonger needs that method.  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or you need to provide a use case 'cause I can't see one  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll see when it happens  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case we have a solution so we're good  \n13:36\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0At any rate, we are relying on what is inherently undefined behavior because aj doesn't promise to make any method at any time.  \n13:36\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0anything starting with ajc$ could appear or disappear at any moment  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again we've already discussed this  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we already have a solution  \n13:36\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ok  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I 'm not sure what you're trying to discuss here :)  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the solution being to add support for excludes in the clirr plugin  \n13:37\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0that works for me.  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and exclude all aspect-internal methods  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and fields  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good  \n13:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Can I ask a n00b question here?

That caused it to think for a while, print something about storage schema updates, and then it returned the main page  \n13:49\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0and now it works  \n13:49\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0That was weird.  \n13:50\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ahh so it fails to load http://127.0.0.1:8080/ but it loads 127.0.0.1:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ ??  \n13:50\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I can't really say. It failed before, but now / redirects to /xwiki/bin/view/Main  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks like a network issue on your OS  \n13:51\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0netstat didn't show port 8080 bound to anything either  \n13:52\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Anyway, I'm a .net developer, but xwiki looks like the best wiki I have so far found.  \n13:52\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0\\o/  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool :)  \n13:53\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0But a bit of a learning curve :)  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah\u2026 we're working on that\u2026 feedback most welcome on how to improve further!

On the other hand, there is quite a disconnect in the functionality, so I am not sure how much sense it makes.  \n14:01\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I tried it out, but ended up preferring to use the wysiwyg + source editor instead  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool then :) It's more to help strong word users transition  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(IMO)  \n14:01\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Right.  \n14:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0can I test a little bit M2 ?

 \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so far I'm the only one trying to lighten the RM's load  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is surprising since I'm not being RM myself ;) I would have expected this to come from RM actually  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I'm not the only one actually if we include automated scripting ;)  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway my personal goal  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to make it easy to be a RM  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is what I'm trrying to do  \n17:08\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I like the idea of putting this job on the debs  \n17:08\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0\\*devs  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I find it has worked quite well  \n17:08\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0this cycle's release notes were a pleasure to not write  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for a new process  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're just missing this little check  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0about whether the RN are complete or not  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie list issues with the filter I've given you  \n17:09\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0What I'm referring to is a bigger trend where we don't have a \"if the dev drops the ball\" process and thus dropping the ball is encouraged.  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I agree  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't have any implementable idea ATM  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again if you have ideas please propose them on the list so that we can debate them and implement them  \n17:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Anyway I intend on writing some mail about this. IMO we need to start with a full understanding, then we can move to ideas.  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sergiu proposed one in the past  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was quite good IMO even though it had some dark aspects too  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why it didn't come through but we can revisit it and continue the discussion to tune it  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've also discussed with you some ideas I had  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't remember...  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but as I said it \u00a0needed some prerequesites  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Got a link?  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the idea about removing milestones and RCs  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: your idea?  \n17:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ah, that one  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(though it was cjd speaking to me ;))  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your idea sdumitriu was the one about wortking on feature branches only  \n17:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It was about heavy feature branch usage, right?  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've discussed it again with jvdrean yesterday and I still think it has some drawbacks \u00a0but I'm sure we can discuss it again and iron out details  \n17:12\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0IIRC the kernel devs have a term called \"drop and run\" where someone pushes some code in and then is unavailable to deal with it when it misbehaves.  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I'm thinking that we should have brainstorming at the XWiki SAS smeinar in july about this  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then make some proposal on the list  \n17:13\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Unfortunately they apparently haven't solved it either..  \n17:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+1  \n17:13\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I don't have any proposal at the moment, I think we first need a full appraisal of what happens and how.  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since you're coming at the seminar too we can have this nice chat about it! :)  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0visually and over some nice drinks  \n17:14\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0someone said that when a question is phrased in the right terms, the answer is clear  \n17:14\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0heh coffee for me ;)  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fine  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that works too  \n17:15\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0anyway I'll take care of the issues and add a note to the release process/plans so I remember this  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I'm progressing nicely on the windows7 install, I think I've found an izpack bug though\u2026. need to find a workaround...  \n17:16\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0awesome  \n17:17\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Something that came to mind is we need to make the HSQL/zip into a \"production ready\" system.  \n17:17\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Because it's so much easier to install.  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it can never be production ready  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my idea is to generate production ready VMs  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using veewee, vagrant, puppet and virtualbox  \n17:18\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0hmm  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one reason \u00a0it can never be prodcution ready  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is because you need to put DB and app server on different machines  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you also need apache front end  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ several system tools  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in addition to system configuration  \n17:19\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0My feeling is that the user should not need to configure apache and mysql  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(system tools = xinit for ex)  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: the only soltion I know that would work is a VM  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for an OOB experience  \n17:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:20\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I recognize that some users will want to use it with weird databases  \n17:20\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0but those types of users probably like putting all kinds of weird combinations together so they're used to some configuration difficulty :)  \n17:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0if we can make the HSQL happy path to scale then our entry level users will love us.  \n17:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, I just tried to install two extensions, and both failed  \n17:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We couldn't find any extension with id 'org.xwiki.contrib:presentation-xwiki-application' and version '1.2'.  \n17:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And the second one:  \n17:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Invalid answer (404) fo the server when requesting  \n17:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Third one:  \n17:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We couldn't find any extension with id 'com.xpn.xwiki.platform.applications:xwiki-application-multipageexport' and version '1.1'.  \n17:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0WTF? No extension works?  \n17:33\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I'm going to add some scripts to the xwiki-release-scripts repo if you don't mind  \n17:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Go ahead  \n17:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That's the goal  \n17:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And the reason why I'd like more devs to be the RM, so that they can improve the scripts  \n17:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm... Fourth one, the IRCBot app, I'm not happy with what it's trying to do  \n17:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Why does it want to install XWiki Platform - Scheduler - UI 4.0?  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it needs it  \n17:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I already have 4.1-SNAPSHOT as a core extension  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah 4.0  \n17:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually no  \n17:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's \"UI\"  \n17:36\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And UI stuff isn't a core extension  \n17:36\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But I have the enterprise-ui-all, which includes scheduler-ui  \n17:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: not from EM point of view since yo imported it as plain xar probably  \n17:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it does not really know what you have  \n17:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I used the zip  \n17:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes the zip package is not yet configured properly to indicate what's in it to EM  \n17:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The standalone zip should probably include some info about the fact that the enterprise-ui-all is used  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the zip does an import  \n17:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it's the same  \n17:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no there is no info about that anywhere at runtime  \n17:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we need to generate an EM index with proper informations in the zip or to put some \"marker\" on xars to discovers them like we discover core extensions  \n17:41\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: re not found extensions, do you have \"simple\" search results ?  \n17:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0is it only with advanced search ?  \n17:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0are you testing on master ?  \n17:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Not search, I tried to install them from the list of extensions displayed when loading the \"Add extensions\" tab  \n17:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so empty search then ok  \n17:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like there is an issue with resolve then  \n17:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what version is it ?  \n17:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You can try installing the presentation, FAQ and multipage-export  \n17:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm on a snapshot between 41M1 and 41M2  \n17:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0did it used to work on this version ?  \n17:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. is it a server side issue  \n17:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0trying on last snapshot  \n17:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: works well for me on last snapshot so it does not seems to be a server issue, maybe you were not lucky with the snapshot version you got  \n17:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0tried with presentation application  \n17:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0multipage export seems ok too  \n17:53\u00a0<CIA-87>\u00a0Sergiu Dumitriu\u000f master\u000f \\* r5053308\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5053308f64eb289bf4cce6e35ec34f5336ae3f74 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-colibri/src/main/resources/colibri/colibri.css :\u000f XE-1178: Preview, Save & Continue, Save & View and Cancel buttons unreadable using Colibri skin - http://git.io/swZ32w  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: you have one issue in this filter: http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=11594  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: could you also fix your issues in this filter: http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=11594 ?  \n18:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Yes, I've been thinking on how to document it  \n18:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I know how now, completing the RN in a few minutes  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note: I've just added RC1 to the filter: http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=11594  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:14\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/xwiki-release-scripts/tree/master/staged  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<jssol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:20\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Hello.
