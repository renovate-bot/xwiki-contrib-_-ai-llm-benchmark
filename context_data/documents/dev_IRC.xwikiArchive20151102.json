I think at least builtin macro should have a corresponding help easy to access from a user perspective  \n12:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe create this as an \"Improvement\" \u00a0issue on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI \u00a0? as it seems it is really missing (and not that hard to implement, too)  \n12:42\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ClemensR, I'm going to  \n12:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0thanks!  \n12:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we could make .../xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/WikiMacros more generic and also add link to the actual documentation in it  \n12:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(we can find the extension of a java class and get the extension.xwiki.org link from the extension id)  \n12:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I thought as a first step one could show the information also shown in the WYSIWYG Editor (i.e what parameters), just for all macros at once, that is definitely doable  \n12:53\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ClemensR, could you review http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12755 and update if needed (didn't know which components I should choose)  \n12:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0components is no problem, that will be set when the implementation happens :)  \n12:56\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I have another question, about the markup used to call macros {{macro}} {{/macro}}. Was it totally mandatory to have distincts opening and closing tags instead of only one ?  \n12:57\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0like it's done in JIRA for ex.  \n12:59\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I suppose it is for nesting needs or something  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, for a) if you have no body you can just use {{macro /}}  \n13:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and b) yes, it is to allow nesting (even though nesting the same macro does not happen very often ... but it is better for the parser anyway)  \n13:01\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ClemensR, thanks  \n13:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:21\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:21\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0guys, can you move the issues you don't plan to work on for 7.3RC1 so that we know what is left to do. The release was planned for today, but since the M2 release was delayed for a few days we can delay the RC1 too, but I'd like to know what is left to do.

Are they related to the recent dependency upgrades you did?  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: probably, I tough I had fixed all the remaining duplicates  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm that's weird, the parboiled one is supposed to be fixed plus I changed the dependency version to 1.1.  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\u00a01.1.7  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(which is what fix the conflict)  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same for the stax-api, lets analyze it from XE war project point of view  \n17:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm looks like a Maven bug  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0stax-api is excluded in the dependencyManagement but still ends up in the WAR  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually it was the opposite, a bug on M2E  \n17:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm for parboiled it's definitely a Maven bug not properly handling dependencyManagement, I will have to move it to commons I guess  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(I get the right one when looking from markdown module but the wrong one when looking from XE)  \n17:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we should maybe start to upgrade the reference Maven version we use I guess  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually it's not better with 3.3.1  \n17:59\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0hey all.. during a distribution upgrade from 7.1.2 to 7.2 tomcat restarted during it \u2026 is there anyway to recover?  \n19:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:58\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:00\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n20:46\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has quit  \n20:58\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:03\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has quit  \n22:03\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:07\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has quit  \n22:16\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:57\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:57\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:03\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n23:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hey Vincent, how's the states ?  \n23:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n23:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
