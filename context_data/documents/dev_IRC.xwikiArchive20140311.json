at least sent it in the confirmation email.  \n16:53\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0send password in mail O\\_o  \n16:54\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0hold on..  \n17:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think XWiki only stores the encrypted value, so all you can do is send that one ... which is not really helpful  \n17:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you could change the password to a temporary randomly generated password, send it to them and ask them to login and change it  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why send a password though?  \n17:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0because it was in the question :) \u00a0\u00a0indeed a broader question might lead to a more simple solution  \n17:02\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0ok, here is the thing. I just configured a new user and he did receive the validate your account email.  \n17:03\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0But when the user clicks the link to activate the account, the link takes the new user to the login page of the wiki. But, how the user could login if he/she don't have the password for the account in order to activate it?  \n17:04\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0maybe I'm missing something.  \n17:04\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0got: USER EMAIL VERIFICATION: YES and AUTHENTICATION ACTIVE CHECK: no  \n17:05\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n17:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, the validation page is not public, that is the problem  \n17:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you cannot run that invitation thing if anonymous users are not allowed to view any pages in the wiki - they need to be able to view the confirmation page at least  \n17:20\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0and what page would be that one in the default pages created by de wizard?  \n17:21\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0give me a minute, I will try to figure this out by my self.  \n17:27\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0ClemensR: you were right. I by mistake close access to guest to the XWiki Space where is actually the page for the activation process. /xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/AccountValidation?validkey  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, there it is :) (I forgot where ....) \u00a0Actually it does not look like such a bad idea to close the XWiki space to public, but unfortunately it sometimes it is  \n17:30\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:30\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0good, now that was resolved. So, how can i send the password of the account in the confirmation email? What if i don't have direct communication with the user i'm creating, and the confirmation email only gives the username but not the password.  \n17:57\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0btw just to add to the topic before, I checked this option: \"Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page or space rights\" and that's why the user could not see the Activation Page.  \n18:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:48\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n20:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:16\u00a0<tvzvod>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<tvzvod>\u00a0has quit  \n20:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:56\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:09\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n21:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:34\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:38\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:10\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:27\u00a0<gallows>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:27\u00a0<benoitc\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:27\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:30\u00a0<gallows>\u00a0has quit  \n22:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:39\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:39\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n22:39\u00a0<benoitc\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n22:39\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n22:41\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:46\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n23:48\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
