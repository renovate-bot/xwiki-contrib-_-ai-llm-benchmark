The build looks ok in general. There are a few tests failing but mostly known (reported) flickers.  \n11:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol is trying to fix AuthenticatingIntegrationTest#sendTextMail and I'm looking into the Webstandard tests because there are some failures that I don't understand.  \n11:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Please hold your commits on the stable-8.1.x branch unless is a critical bug fix.  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: committed something, we'll see if it helps for http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform\\_Quality-8.1.x/lastBuild/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-mail-send-default/testReport/org.xwiki.mail.integration/AuthenticatingIntegrationTest/sendTextMail/  \n11:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n11:42\u00a0<nn>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<nn>\u00a0Hello. Does anybody knows how to avoid transformations of {<, >, ...} to html entities in xwiki-rendering?  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nn: using the xhtml/1.0 renderer?  \n11:55\u00a0<nn>\u00a0yep exactly  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what would you expect instead? (since < are not valid in xml and need to be escaped)  \n11:56\u00a0<nn>\u00a0I want to write something like <span style=\"color: red;\">red text</span>  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's not valid text  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I understand  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you want to inject html  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for that you need to use a RawBlock block  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in xwiki syntax you get that block when using the {{html}} macro for ex)  \n11:57\u00a0<nn>\u00a0Haha ok  \n11:57\u00a0<nn>\u00a0Is there anything equivalent to the rawblock in the mediawiki syntax?  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n11:58\u00a0<nn>\u00a0thank you  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can\"t find one  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this only exists for XWiki Syntaxes AFAIK  \n12:01\u00a0<nn>\u00a0Ok. Thank you anyway  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually no that's not correct  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also supported for the markdown syntax  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since MD supports embedded html and thus we support it too in our MD parser)  \n12:03\u00a0<nn>\u00a0Ok. We'll consider switching away from the mediawiki syntax then. We don't have much content yet anyway.  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not a bad idea imo :)  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the xwiki syntax is much more powerful and it allows you to use the WYSIWYG editor too (if you're using the xwiki runtime)  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that xwiki can convert mediawiki into xwiki syntax  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you probably know that already)  \n12:05\u00a0<nn>\u00a0I wasn't sure  \n12:05\u00a0<nn>\u00a0That's good to know  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's very easy to do at page level  \n12:05\u00a0<nn>\u00a0I just began working on this project this morning  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/PageEditing#HConvertingbetweenSyntaxes  \n12:07\u00a0<nn>\u00a0Ok. I've got to check if that's an option with another developer  \n12:07\u00a0<nn>\u00a0Thank you very much :)  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k, np  \n12:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: actually I think you can just put html directly in mediawiki syntax but our mediawiki parser probably does not support it  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I've chceked and it doesn't  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's what I was checking for nn before)  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re the mediawiki syntax, I don't think that's true  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it may be an extension but AFAIK only a small subset is allowed  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would need to check more  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but since we don't support it right now anyway...  \n12:14\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0try putting <script> tags into wikipedia?  \n12:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes you can't put any html  \n12:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you can put HTML  \n12:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:HTML\\_in\\_wikitext  \n12:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I see this in the logs https://gist.github.com/mflorea/dbbbebd622c7bc57025821f52fafc5d6 after leaving XWiki 8.1 opened for a while. I know you worked on this area. Should I report it?  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yep and we do support a few of those already  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which we convert to known blocks when they exist  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: already reported  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we only support those for which we have known blocks ATM  \n12:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(more precisely for which wikimodel has known events)  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like <sup>, <del>, etc  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: my point is that what nn was trying to do is valid in standard mediawiki  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we just don't support it  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea/tmortagne: I'm hesitating to release 8.1 with those wztnings  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*warnings  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie a final version)  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: you actually removed the fix for in the issue that reported this warning  \n12:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0( http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13407 )  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok re what nn was doing, indeed <span> is valid in medawiki markup  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and we could even support it with format block I think  \n12:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0@tmortagne: indeed, because from the comments it didn't seem something critical  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: \u00a0it is not  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not reported AFAICS: http://jira.xwiki.org/issues/?jql=component%20%3D%20%22Syntax%20-%20mediawiki%2F1.0%22%20AND%20project%20%3D%20XRENDERING%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically it's always been like this but now we indicate it's bad  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but we should fix it ASAP because it's not clean  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically it's bad but not worst that it's been since a while  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue for 8.1 is not fixing the source issue but the warning in the logs for me and that part is worse than before ;)  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc if we can fix the source then all the better  \n12:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't have the time to work on it in the coming days (late on openid connect stuff)  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the main problem is that it would be a pain to have to release a 8.1.1 quickly after  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from what I have seen it seems to be mostly about removing useless stuff  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'd remove the check for 8.1  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or instead make it debug  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since the absract is already taking care of the context  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I don't understand why watchlist job does too  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0put it at debug level in 8.1 final and keep it as warning on master  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so thjaty we remember to fix the source issue  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*that  \n12:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0using debug level for 8.1 sounds good to me (since it's a known issue)  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea/tmortagne: btw have you seen http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13437 ? any idea?  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now it means we cannot install the markdown syntax from contrib with EM  \n12:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I think there is already another issue about the WYIWYG service always executed in the main wiki  \n12:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now for the EM part it's not exactly true, you can install it on root namespace  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's a good point  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could force it on the main wiki for now  \n12:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which makes more sense anyway since I doubt you want to use it only on one wiki, but anyway this WYSIWYG context thing is bad and should be fixed in the new WYSIWYG  \n12:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the new wysiwyg is still using the conversion filter  \n12:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue is only in path based, right ?  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not only  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK  \n12:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the conversion filter is applied to standard xwiki actions, there's no difference between domain and path-based  \n12:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the difference is only for GWT-RPC services, but this is not the case here  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the wikiid is not set in the context  \n12:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it does not even take into account the domain name  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correct  \n12:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the issue is that it is a servlet filter, called before the XWiki action servlet  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've detailed in comments what could be done  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's far from easy  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I had tried to do that some time ago and never finished my refactoring, basically we need to move the init to a filter that executes with a high priority  \n12:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0on the wysiwyg editor side the need is to convert the submitted HTML content to wiki syntax before it reaches XWiki, and to be able to cancel the save/preview in case of conversion failure and to send the user back to edit mode.  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(full init that is, including progress ui at startup)  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm getting something strange with the namespace restictions on master  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://www.evernote.com/l/AHcthF2H1SBGOatE0azBmi7nXujEoooMIGw  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0removing the limitation to see if it works  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep works  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: we might have a regression in 8.1 too  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically <xwiki.extension.namespaces>{root}</xwiki.extension.namespaces> doesn't seem to work anymore  \n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example this means that the vfs module cannot be installed anymore in xwiki  \n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see what tmortagne says  \n13:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n13:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you are on main wiki ?
