Bot IE8 and IE9 tests hang. The xwiki instance is shutdown before all the tests get to run  \n13:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I have tried several things, but without success  \n13:32\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0vmassol: yes that's why I asked if we shouldn't have builds for 4.2.x at this point  \n13:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: Enygma`is creating (or created maybe already) the 4.2 jobs  \n13:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0jvelo: I`ve noticed the lack of -4.2 jobs today and will create them. This part was not documented in the release plan/help.  \n13:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0re the platform failure, we should investigate that better  \n13:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I think we have a problem in the build  \n13:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0when we have a new version, test-jars are not found and the build fails  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: can you reproduce by cleaning your ocal repo and building with -o?  \n13:44\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: ok thanks for the update  \n13:50\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: trying to reproduce locally by using a clean local repository and building only xwiki-platform-extension-script  \n13:56\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0guys, vmassol . release notes for a final version is recap of all milestones and RCs, right? Should I copy over feature descriptions, or do we edit new summaries for each features ?  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelo: copy  \n13:56\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0OK  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's a recap  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that we build by copying and aggregating  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if things are not that important you can move them to Miscellaneous  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they could have been important for a release beciuase there was not much else done\u2026 and not that important for the overall RN for a release ;)  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you can just do the aggreation and we can review toegther  \n13:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0yep  \n13:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0and consolidate when a feature is spread accross releases etc.  \n13:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0ok  \n14:13\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: can`t reproduce it locally using the mentioned method. Well, the tests froze due to a ConcurrentModificationException, but tmortagne knows about that.  \n14:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0quick question: is it normal to get the distribution wizard when performing a migration ?  \n14:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: that's the idea yes, you cange the WAR so you need to install the corresponding XAR  \n14:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/cange/changed/  \n14:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I see.  \n14:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's actually the main goal  \n14:15\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: can you create the jobs for 4.2 ?  \n14:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the install one was more bonus  \n14:16\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0jvelo: doing this now, but it will take a bit due to the tricky dependencies between jobs and the fact that Jenkins insists that there are no non-existing jobs referenced... so it's twice the work :)  \n14:18\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: OK. thanks  \n14:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:31\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0sdumitriu: Hi, can you allow my PURL user (jvelociter) to create RN links ? Thanks  \n14:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0guys, lease take a look at this. it might be serious  \n14:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8252  \n14:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n14:41\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it's like everything we fixed since 3.3.1 I can see it as a conflict between 3.3.1 and 4.2-RC1  \n14:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: wait I did \u00a0not see it was 3.3.1  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so you did not installed the previous version with EM or the Wizard ?  \n14:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0no  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ho so that's whay  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0EM does not have any idea what you have in your wiki  \n14:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i have a 3.3.1 installed the old way, by importing the XAR raditionally.  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it does not know it's 3.3.1 or even what is it  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so there is no way for it to compare  \n14:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well if someone wants to migrate from 2.7 or 3.1 . he will get tons of these  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's the main goal for displaying the Wyzard t install: make sure the UI is installed trough EM so that we know what is installed  \n14:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: yes  \n14:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but it's not ok. I've spent 10 minutes clicking n continue. And still clicking  \n14:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this makes the distribution wizard a true pain  \n14:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's because there is a lot of differences between 3.3.1 and 4.2 snapshot  \n14:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the plan for this is to allow the user to indicate what is the currently installed UI  \n14:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but we did not had time to do it in the UI  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so it means we cannot recommend upgrading to 4.2 :(  \n14:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes. but the users won't care. they will say something is bad because they have to spend 15 minutes clicking continue  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+1 sburjan  \n14:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: surely not.  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this will need to be added in big bold red letters in the 4.2RC1 and 4.2 final release notes  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie that it should be used if not upgrading only or otherwise you'll have to spend time merging all differences that happened between your version and 4.2  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the comment should specify that the user can still upgrade by choosing skip and doing an import as before  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the comment should reference the JIRA issue to fix this  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not skip, cancel  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes cancel  \n14:52\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok. after 20 minutes of clicking, I'm done :)  \n14:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0question: doing this, and importing the XAR old school, won't prologue the issue to oher versions ? because Em still won't be aware of what is installed.  \n14:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: yes  \n14:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well  \n14:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not exactly actually  \n14:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since there is a hack in the standard importer to register as extension the imported XAR  \n14:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it will be ui-all instead of ui but EM will know what's installed  \n14:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0oh cool. so we import the xar old method and the xwiki will see it as instaled via EM ?  \n14:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, that's cool  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n14:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and since ui-all declare ui and all its dependencies as virtual ids it will be found as previous version of ui-all  \n14:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: what no ?  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"EM will know what's installed\"  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you install with import EM will not know, right?  \n14:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I just explained why it will know it  \n14:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's the vote I sent recently to put the extension id in the poackage.xml  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that's cool didn't realize it has this effect  \n15:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0note: only if you have access to the repository while importing the XAR  \n15:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so importing the xar in 4.2 using the old way, will make EM aware of the extensions installed, so for future versions Distro Wizard won't see many conflicts. Did I understood properly ?  \n15:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's a bit complex to upgrade from ui-all to ui and has to be well tested but in theory yes  \n15:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0guys, it seems that the export and print preview features don't preserve the query string of the document. This means that dynamic documents whose output is different based on some query string parameters are not properly exported. I view this as a bug and I want to check if this is by design (i.e. you could say that the document from the db is printed, not the one modified by the query string). WDYT?  \n15:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I understand. But ATM this can't be tested because we have no 4.3. Right ?  \n15:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: AFAIK the way export work is not really by exporting the current document but what to export is listed in the query string and the export action is called  \n15:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: actually there is several way to test  \n15:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\\* the quickest is to add a descriptor by hand in the EM index  \n15:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and restart  \n15:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0for example in your case you add the 3.3.1 ui-all to the EM index  \n15:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm talking no single page export, in which case the only required export query string is \"format=foo\". Ofc, adding the document query string to the export query string results in a proper export  \n15:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0s/no/about  \n15:08\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so in 4.2-rc1 i add the 3.3.1 ui-all descriptor in EM ? (before using the distro wizard) ?  \n15:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: actually depends what export we were talking about  \n15:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I was talking about html one  \n15:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: for example yes  \n15:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this means that Distro Wizard won't work well until the user imports the XAR using the old method ?  \n15:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the Wizard will not be able to to 3 way merge until it knows what's installed already  \n15:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ouch. this will hurt  \n15:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: it doesn't matter the export type. As long as it's a single page export, adding the document query string to the export query string works fine.  \n15:12\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it adds onemore step to the migration process  \n15:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: not if we add right in the UI a way to indicate what's currently installed  \n15:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in the Wizard  \n15:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we already talked about that with mflorea \u00a0but we were too short for 4.2  \n15:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sburjan: it's a work in progress, the first version  \n15:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, but before we indicate what's curently installed we have to import the xar old way to make the EM aware of what is installed, righ ? \u00a0(vote about vote sent recently to put the extension id in the poackage.xml)  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: \"the quickest is to add a descriptor by hand in the EM index\"  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we would simply do pretty much that in the Wizard  \n15:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0does postgres support XEM ?  \n15:33\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:33\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0is now known as <evalica>  \n15:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: I get error s when trying to install Workspaces on a postgres instance. is postgres supported ?

I`ve launched a build of xwiki-commons-4.2 that should trigger all the rest  \n15:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: just a second  \n15:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: OK great. Thanks for this  \n15:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: no creating a wiki is not fully supported with pgsql  \n15:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but you can use pgsql if you create the actual databases yourself  \n15:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK  \n15:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in any case you don't have to test it  \n15:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the only thing officially supported in virtual mode in MySQL  \n15:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe Oracle I'm not sure  \n15:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0getting a stack in 5 minz  \n15:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: see jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-1960  \n15:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0thanks  \n15:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i was thinking only oracle doesn't support XEM  \n15:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: http://pastebin.com/8ruC8MQf. But as tmortagne said, i guess this is normal  \n16:03\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0sburjan: that looks weird... the error message is more or less messed up since it's like activity stream failed, but I guess it`s related to what tmortagne mentioned since it fails at saving a document inside the new wiki template.  \n16:32\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: is it me or the build of commons hasn't triggered rendering, etc. ?  \n16:35\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0jvelo: looking into it  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it should have been triggered  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the -4.2 jobs have exactly the same configuration as the ones for master  \n16:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and, for example, rendering has checked the option \"Build whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built\"  \n16:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so after a build of commons, it should have been triggered  \n16:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so I`m a bit puzzled  \n16:52\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: strange..  \n16:52\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0all the configuration seems to be right  \n16:53\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and now strangely a build was triggered for xwiki-platform-4.2 because of a commit on stable-4.2.x from 6 hours ago...  \n16:54\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: could you please have a quick look over the -4.2 jobs to see if you spot a problem?  \n16:55\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0specifically why did not xwiki-rendering-4.2 get triggered once xwiki-commons-4.2 finished.  \n17:17\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0should we trigger rendering manually for now ?  \n17:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo, Enygma`: it did not triggered it because rendering does not know it depends on commons- 4.2  \n17:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and that's because it has never been built  \n17:20\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0hehe  \n17:20\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0OK  \n17:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it did not parsed the maven informations  \n17:21\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I guess it does that for platform as well ?  \n17:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0probably  \n17:21\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it means we need to trigger all TLP manually the first time ?  \n17:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0except that someone started it it seems  \n17:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: I guess  \n17:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see how jenkins could know the ids without doing a git clone  \n17:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is something weird in the rendering configuration fail  \n17:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it gives an error  \n17:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0http://jenkins.xwiki.org/view/Rendering/job/xwiki-rendering-4.2/configure  \n17:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\"Failed \u00a0to connect to repository : Error performing command: /usr/bin/git \u00a0ls-remote -h git://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering.git HEAD\"  \n17:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it's able to find it itself actually  \n17:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but since it could not check the repository...  \n17:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0does someone see anything wrong in this repository ?  \n17:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0commons produces the same error actually  \n17:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: AFAIK, all jobs have that error listed  \n17:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's new  \n17:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but they work  \n17:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0first time I see this error  \n17:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it`s like this since 2 weeks  \n17:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a02 weeks is not that long :)  \n17:31\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so to make sure I understand the triggering issue: all top level projects (at least commons, rendering, platform enterprise and manager) need to be manually triggered the first time after the branch has been changed in the configuration?  \n17:31\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0to make sure they do a git pull on the newly configured branch?  \n17:32\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: the issue is that they don't have any ide on which job they depends until they know what they are  \n17:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and for that they need to check the pom.xml files  \n17:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe they automatically to a remote check of the pom.xml but it seems to fail  \n17:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so we have to either commit something or force the build  \n17:34\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0right... seems reasonable :)  \n17:34\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0thanks for the info :)  \n17:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0did we upgraded the git/github plugin recently to cause this error ?  \n17:35\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I would not know that...  \n17:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like we are fully up to date  \n17:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I just tried this command and it works well for me  \n17:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not sure why it fail on jenkins  \n17:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe git is too old  \n17:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0actually there is no git on root jenkins...  \n17:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's probably why  \n17:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it's probably a new feature  \n17:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0fixed  \n18:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0XWiki debian repository is now properly GPG signed ;)  \n18:11\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0jvelo: are you branching 4.2.x for 4.2.0?

It would be nice if they would first do this temporary local release branch step for \\*all\\* the projects and then proceed with the building. This way devs would not have to wait for the release to finish in order to start committing.  \n18:20\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0OK  \n18:20\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I see  \n18:20\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but until then, if you want to do branching, you have to do it manually or modify the scripts...  \n18:21\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0cjd\\_: can you wait a bit or do you want me to branch right now ?  \n18:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: no usually we don't  \n18:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(create release branches)  \n18:21\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0it's fine with me  \n18:22\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0I'll just make a mental note to backport that at some point  \n18:26\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0cjd\\_: OK  \n18:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:38\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0platform 4.2 build failed with \"could not find artifact org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-extension-api:jar:tests:4.2-SNAPSHOT\"  \n18:38\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0though I can find a tests SNAPSHOT in http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons-extension-api/4.2-SNAPSHOT/  \n18:54\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<coud3>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<coud3>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<coud4>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:33\u00a0<coud3>\u00a0has quit  \n19:39\u00a0<coud4>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<coud4>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:25\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:25\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I wonder if it is feasible if we start building packages for all supported database  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean VMs?  \n21:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0no, builds like we have XEM with MySQL, and so on  \n21:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0XE + postgres  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't package mysql  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure it's interesting  \n21:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0somethin liek we have wiki-manager-jetty-mysql, to have it for psql  \n21:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0something to work with psql out of the box  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only differences are:  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- the driver jar  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- a few lines in hibernate.cfg.xml  \n21:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0without adding jars and modifying hibernate  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so another option is to bundle all jars  \n21:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes. i am thinking for testing, but having one universal build could be good for end-users to  \n21:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0les steps in instalation  \n21:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*less  \n21:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0one step less, adding the jar more exactly  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me it's the first install step when you start XE  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the first time)  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you get to select the DB and params  \n21:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes. unsless you use the hsqldb build  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can probably have a single distribution for all  \n21:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this will increase a little bit the size of the package, but I guess it's negligible  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't have to be, we can download them too from maven, our choice  \n21:50\u00a0<steph\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s / maven / our extension repo  \n21:50\u00a0<steph\\_\\_>\u00a0'lot there!  \n21:51\u00a0<steph\\_\\_>\u00a0... or 'lo in fact.  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hello  \n21:52\u00a0<steph\\_\\_>\u00a0I've been investigating a way to get the parent page autocomplete to work with french accents, but to no avail. I've followed the encoding guide for UTF-8 to the letter, and am stil dumbfounded at what I could have missed... Is there something related to encoding, but not mentioned in there that I could check?  \n21:56\u00a0<steph\\_\\_>\u00a0Ok, maybe it was a dumb question... :p  \n21:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0steph\\_\\_: It should work...  \n21:59\u00a0<steph\\_\\_>\u00a0Yeah, I was thinking so, too. It's just strange as it works properly in the pages, the page names are properly converted to their unicode http equivalent... It's just the autocomplete that interprets the character as an ISO one.  \n21:59\u00a0<steph\\_\\_>\u00a0But we're still on an old version - 3.5 - and it might have changed since then. Could find something related in the changelogs, though.  \n22:02\u00a0<steph\\_\\_>\u00a0I'll try an update, then, hopefully I should find a way.
