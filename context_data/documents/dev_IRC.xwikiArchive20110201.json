What would make sense is to change injection from field injection to method/constructor but so far we decided not to do that  \n09:53\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's not too diffcult for those but pretty useless  \n09:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0And #1 people can (and are likely to) use a module with no dependencies, #2 people using a module outside of the platform are more likely to propose patches, #3 it's free name recognision.  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(they don't do anything useful and you can already depend on them)  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but that's not xwiki  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just go to apache commons  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if there's no link with other xwiki modules it's not xwiki related stuff  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it should be moved to a generic location  \n09:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So I should move transation and locking out of xwiki?  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the shade plugin or jarjar is abad solution  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if transaction is not using components then yes, this is why I proposed to reuse an existingframework in my mail  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in that case it's more generic than xwiki and has nothing to do in xwiki  \n09:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think your assertion that it's \"useless\" is throwing away a golden opertunty.  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki would just be forge for it but without a real tie  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this case  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's more debatable for stuff that relates to wiki stuff though  \n09:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you have a group of people deciding what enterprise wiki to use and one pipes up and says \"I know the name xwiki, I used one of their modules for a project\", that might seal the deal.  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but then there's 100% chance that they'll use other xwiki modules one way or another  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: there's no problem in making xwiki-transaction module not depend on any other module  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now what I think you're hinting at  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to propose to make it a top level project  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'd be ?1 till we see it committed, it's used for a while, etc  \n09:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Agreed. I like it but I agree with you there :)  \n09:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Finally, got it working... Good night  \n09:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm only using it as an example, I as a matter of habbit write as much code with as few dependencies as possible.  \n10:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0gnight  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: nn (not sure what's working but sounds good)  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: sure but we need specific examples and yes I'm +1 on limiting deps  \n10:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0PDF Export passing DOM Documents around instead of Strings  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but not at the detriment of removing features that are good for us)  \n10:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So I end up with a lot of \"primatives\" and I often think someone else could use that, they would likely have patches for it too, and it would spread the xwiki name.  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(like if you reinvent DI just not to depend on xwiki-component is bad IMO)  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: sure, we want to do the same for the xwiki rendering engine, thart's why it can be used standalone  \n10:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe, I try not to reinvent anything unless I cannot find something which meets my specifications.  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mean all code in xwiki should use component wherever they can  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wherever it makes sense rather  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and they shouldn't not use components because they couldn't be used outside without depending on xwiki-component  \n10:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Speaking of xwiki-xml  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would be a very bad rationale IMO  \n10:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Agreed.  \n10:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If I want to use XmlScriptService someplace else, how do I get it?  \n10:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But often I end up with \"functions\" which don't live very long and have their dependencies handed to them in their constructor.  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: wdym?  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someplace else = ?  \n10:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0How do I get an instance of it  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cm.lookup(...)  \n10:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0With any other type of component I'd request it as a dependency  \n10:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But ScriptServices don't actually have an interface  \n10:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I need the exact methods in the class  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm this is done for being used by introspection actually  \n10:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So, I can either lookup and cast back to XmlScriptService, which is not so safe (someone might provide a different implementation for the \"xml\" hint)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes I agree  \n10:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or I can bypass the CM and make a new instance myself  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to think about it  \n10:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or I can make a different interface for it  \n10:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Can a component implementation implement two roles?  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IF sounds the best but we need to think how it would be implemented  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and no  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if 2 roles then you'll have 2 instances  \n10:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If that's the only downside, I can live with two instances  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where do you need it?  \n10:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, I already used it in the escapetool override  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it' not made to be reused  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reused outside of scripts that is  \n10:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And I wanted to use it in PdfExportImpl, since it also needs a lot of XML handling  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're probably using something not made to be used in this context  \n10:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, I know  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO this means we need some java APIs for what you need  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to not go through the script service)  \n10:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, I wonder if Apache Commons has something for XML  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have XMLUtils for ex  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems there's overlap between both now  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0both = XMLUtils and XMLScriptService  \n10:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0cjdelisle: Did you look at http://commons.apache.org/transaction/ ?  \n10:10\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I looked at their lock manager, it is primative IMO  \n10:11\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I wanted to use it but detecting deadlock is worst case exponential time, and it has no way to break deadlock, just rollback a thread and try again hoping it has cleared.  \n10:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Deadlock can be broken efficiently by \"trading locks\" and it can be detected in worst case liniar time.  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: is their project dead? did you try to talk to them?  \n10:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't know. I couldn't find anyone who was implementing locks the way I wanted.  \n10:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0No I didn't talk to them.  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you were talking about exposure, implementing your idea in apache land in this project would get it even more attention for ex  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm not saying we should do that, but you might want to consider it)  \n10:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That is one path. Ofc it's a different license and the world will know it as apache instead of xwiki.  \n10:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0DeadlockBreakingLock is still an infant. When I get some more time I will implement the rest of it's methods and I might write a paper about it.  \n10:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://commons.apache.org/transaction/apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/AbstractTransactionalResourceManager.html#commitTransaction%28%29  \n10:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Same path: begin(); try { doStuff(); commit(); } catch (e) { rollback(); }  \n10:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Also more complex than TR, it doesn't offer what TR does but TR doesn't offer what this does.  \n10:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0(doesn't offer everything that...)  \n10:42\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0hello. I have a short question. I have a 2.7 final XE. I created a simple user, and changed my profile Image. AS doesn't log that change, but the avatar gets updated in other modifications from AS. Is this normal ?  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what other modifications sburjan`?  \n10:50\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0Create a page, create a space, etc .. those appear in AS .. but changing the profile Image doesnt.
