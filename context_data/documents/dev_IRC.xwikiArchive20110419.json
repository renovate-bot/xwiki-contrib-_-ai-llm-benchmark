I'm wondering if we should change their parent to xwiki-core-parent, wdyt? (for tag I'll add a pom to group the plugin and the app)  \n22:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, we should change the parent  \n22:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'll do it  \n22:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Did you manage to merge xwiki-application-tag-1.20 ?  \n22:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I got a conflict when trying it  \n22:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, I got the conflict with a pom from a different module, but I removed the pom from the commit and I added the 1.20 tag app pom which was missing  \n22:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the rest looks good  \n22:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, poms cause a lot of merge conflicts, since they look very similar  \n23:33\u00a0<hppyfeey11>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:34\u00a0<hppyfeey11>\u00a0hi everyone, I have being reading the manual, developer guide and other documentation i can find on the XWikisite  \n23:36\u00a0<hppyfeey11>\u00a0Noww i am planning to make this Calendar App. Can I go ahead using java.
