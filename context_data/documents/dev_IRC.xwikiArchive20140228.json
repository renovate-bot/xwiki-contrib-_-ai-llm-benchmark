 \n08:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the build is failing  \n08:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the problem :)  \n08:59\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0(if I don't, maven complains that the pom where invalid)  \n08:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our maven build can be run from any module without the need to have anything in your local repo  \n08:59\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I do not get the issue right now, if you do, could you explains ?  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you done what I said?  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"to reproduce remove the xwiki artifacts form your local repo and try building xwiki-platform/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-office/xwiki-platform-office-importer for example\"  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/form/from  \n09:00\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I don't understand the problem ATM  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I knew the problem I'd fix it, still trying to understand what's wrong  \n09:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I have moved the dependency management for those deps from platfom pom to commons pom  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know what you did  \n09:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0if commons poms does not get deployed, platform cannot build anymore, obviously  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the reason why we have a CI  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so let's check that  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe jenkins was down and didn't deploy the top level pom  \n09:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0we have 2 CI actually  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only 1 pushes stuff to the maven remote repo  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's jenkins\u00e0  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0)  \n09:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0do you mean, Jenkins should do the job ?  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other one (TC) is not operational yet  \n09:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0if so, the issue is simple, Jenkins has not build commons  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Commons/job/xwiki-commons/ seems to have worked  \n09:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0have juste launch it just before you ask me  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the commons artifacts must have been pushed  \n09:03\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so for some reason  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it didn't get triggered  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I see changes in your manual trigger  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Commons/job/xwiki-commons/1243/  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe our CI was in a bad shape  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus didn't build it  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then we had a cron restart the CI  \n09:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Jenkins seems absolutely unreliable currently  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n09:05\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0is your experiment with TC conclusive ?  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not yet  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's still not full configured  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we need to use it for real  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first step is to make it build everything correctly  \n09:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for sure, but according to what I see from Jenkins, it could not be worse :)  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it is  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't build everything  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(yet)  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that's slightly worse :)  \n09:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0really, Jenkins has build nothing from my changes  \n09:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0could it be worse ?  \n09:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0while TC have failed due to Jenkins, BTW !  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can have TC push to our remote maven repo  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was hesitating because of the conflict that can be caused by this  \n09:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for sure, this could be an issue  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm tC failed again  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder why  \n09:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0all I said finaly, is that we do not trust Jenkins much, your recent ML thread confirm that  \n09:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0does TC get the latest pom or does it used the cached ones ?  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW we still don't have a license for TC, jetbrains haven't replied yet  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's supposed to use the latest one  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've configured it with -U  \n09:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0looking at the logs, it does not  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looking at the logs it does :)  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0search for -U  \n09:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0pom was from 07:46:20  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you can see it says:  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Downloading: http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons-pom/6.0-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in here: http://teamcity.xwiki.org/viewLog.html?buildId=51&buildTypeId=XWikiPlatform\\_Default&tab=buildLog  \n09:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Downloaded: http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons-pom/6.0-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-commons-pom-6.0-20140228.074620-22.pom  \n09:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a007:46:20  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the latest  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons/6.0-SNAPSHOT/  \n09:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yep, its GMT  \n09:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0sorry  \n09:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but not the right pom we need :)  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why not?

Thomas needs the status file in order to try to reproduce, but he's not available for a few days. You can report an issue and attach the job status  \n10:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: is that file still available after upgrade, which one it is exactly ?

:)  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems you're adding a merge commit when you push  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've noticed this a few times already  \n10:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0git fetch && git merge origin/master  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that's the issue then  \n10:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, but how else ?  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be nice if you could use \u2014rebase instead  \n10:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, have to look this up  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0git pull --rebase  \n10:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, never know about that one - learn something new about git every day, thanks !  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yw  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: I also wanted to thank you for your participation in the xwiki dev, it's great to see you so active every day! :)  \n10:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0thanks, but no need, I want to see less issues in XWiki too ... less complaints from our users, too :)  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n10:52\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0what exactly does \"Awaiting committer feedback\" mean (as pull request status in jira) ?  \n10:54\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: if for that particular issue there is a pull request, some committer should look at it and apply it.  \n10:55\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0evalica: yup, thanks  \n10:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: \u00a0if it is your pull request, then it is ok to push the issue in chat - I have figured out that this helps :)  \n10:58\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: yup, i've discussed it here with tmortagne a month ago, then he changed that to this status :) its XWIKI-3544 which practically breaks rendering cache  \n10:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, tmortagne is away for a few days, unfortunately  \n10:59\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep  \n11:00\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n11:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the trouble with the \"big pull requests\" is it takes more time to look at it, so it is necessary to be persistent about it ...  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this TC view is quite nice, you have JIRA integration: http://teamcity.xwiki.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=XWikiCommons\\_Default&tab=buildTypeIssueLog  \n11:04\u00a0<Sidali>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: btw I get \"There are 65 checkstyle errors.\" when applying the pull request locally  \n11:12\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: thanks, going to check that... i remember i've turned checkstyle off, because i wasn't able to compile platform itself  \n11:25\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:32\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: by the way, i'm testing the distribution wizard on 5.4.2 now, on first run it had the same problem, but in stdout there were some warnings (cannot compare two attachments), so i found out my dev storage was out of sync with production... i've synced that and now it looks like it's working... three subwikis upgraded in a row without stucking  \n11:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, cool it is running smooth for far, keeping finger crossed that it continues that way  \n11:46\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: yep, it looks like it's working, 7 subwikis successfully upgraded, another 14 to go :) going to skip them and check extensions... there is just hell of a invocationtargetexceptions \u00a0(Couldn't instantiate the class for type with id 4012 on class class org.apache.poi.hslf.record.StyleTextProp9Atom), but i guess they are office-specific errors  \n11:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0meh, what is that ... happens while upgrading ?  \n11:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: Thomas broke Clirr with https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/3ff2ebbf4601870e7773191350ec76479b2230a7 . I don't understand exactly why is the change needed, so we have two options: revert or add excludes for http://pastebin.com/i74Hdb08 WDYT?  \n11:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep, but it might be problem with solr indexing (i use remote solr instance)  \n11:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, yes, it needs to reindex everything after the update (I think)  \n11:50\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup  \n12:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: well, so far it works without problem, but just noticed \"Successfully applied [UPGRADE] for extension [XWiki Platform - Panels - UI 5.4.2] on namespace [$escapetool.xml($argument)] from previous extension [org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-panels-ui-5.0]\"  \n12:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0duh, no escapetool in the context when rendering the message ... or $argument is undefined  \n12:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0why didnt' I see that ...  \n12:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0i guess there is just typo somewhere :)  \n12:48\u00a0<Sidali\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:49\u00a0<Sidali>\u00a0has quit  \n12:49\u00a0<Sidali\\_>\u00a0is now known as <Sidali>  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: did this \"[$escapetool.xml($argument)]\" happen for the main wiki or subwikis ?  \n13:00\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0if i remember correctly, it happened for global extension... logs should be in status.xml right?  \n13:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes!  \n13:04\u00a0<Sidali\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:05\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0well, it happened for global extensions (jobs/status/extension/action/...), this is part of status.xml - https://ezcrypt.it/Sd8n#2LjeAMXvDIKLmHv64CnQjPyg  \n13:06\u00a0<Sidali>\u00a0has quit  \n13:06\u00a0<Sidali\\_>\u00a0is now known as <Sidali>  \n13:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0so it's more like problem with distribution wizard (<null/>)  \n13:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, maybe \u00a0it is a null in there because the extension had no name in 5.0.3  \n13:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0at least it explains why I did not get the same message :)  \n13:10\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep, it's possible... enterprise UI had different artifact back then before 5.2, so i had to specify it on the first two pages  \n13:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes that platform-attachment-ui is new compared to 5.0.3, and the log message did not expect this and logged a null  \n13:21\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, any ideas why org.xwiki.wiki.internal.descriptor.DefaultWikiDescriptor.getWikiId() doesn't work in velocity? (or if there is better way how to get all current subwikis instead of $services.wiki.all)  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice view: http://teamcity.xwiki.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=XWikiCommons\\_Default&tab=buildTypeChangeLog  \n13:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:09\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys please note that I've taken agent-2-1 offline for jenkins  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I'm using it for TC now  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so please don't enable it :)  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(otherwise it'll cause conflicts, when running func tests for example or for VNC start/stop)  \n14:24\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:27\u00a0<Sidali>\u00a0has quit  \n14:29\u00a0<Sidali>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: IMO thomas is very wrong  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I really don't get it why he changed the package which was ok to something that is obviously wrong  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just commented on https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/87a4519e74fadebbdad37e109d7d655e6755b167 )  \n14:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n14:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I don't understand either, that's why I reverted, but then he put it back  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep seen that and commented  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it still is wrong\u2026.  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's still wrong  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we mixed up directory names with package names  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I created the \"compatbiitliy\" dir  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the goal was a directory where to locate compatibiltiy aspects  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this was to separate it from other types of aspects we might want to be used like performance or logging aspects or...  \n14:36\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, we still don't know what problem he tried to fix  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure there's a problem to fix actually :)  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking chat  \n14:37\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I think that's it  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone removed the config I had put in the past  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://mojo.codehaus.org/aspectj-maven-plugin/compile-mojo.html#aspectDirectory  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thomas probably removed it to use the default but he didn't remove the \"compatibility\" directory  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's still set in some places  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in xwiki-platform-legacy for example it's there  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<aspectDirectory>src/main/aspect/compatibility</aspectDirectory>  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's missing in rendering and probably commons, checking  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok in commons devs have not used the compatibility directory  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nor in rendering  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what thomas did is actually wrong IMO  \n14:44\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now in order to be homogeneous we just need to decide if we want to keep that directory or remove it  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we're using specific moduels for legacy stuff I think we could remove it  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and still be safe)  \n14:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm fine with both, but the current compatibility.\\* package is strange  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's definitely wrong  \n14:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so either keep the folder but not the package or remove the folder (and ofc the pacakge)  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:06\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:20\u00a0<Sidali>\u00a0has quit  \n15:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:55\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:58\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:59\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:06\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n16:27\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n17:02\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:02\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:37\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit\n"}
