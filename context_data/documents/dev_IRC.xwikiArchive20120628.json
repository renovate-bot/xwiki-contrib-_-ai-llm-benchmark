I also did a quick test and velocity macros inside gadget content work, but of course, only 1 level :)  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks worng  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we consider gadgets to contain velcoity by default?  \n16:40\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0no  \n16:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0or actually, I don`t know  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0iamcorbin: can you paste your content?  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the whole content of your gadget  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in wiki syntax  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0a quick test:  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0having this is a gadget`s content:  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0{{velocity}}  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0$doc.fullName  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0{{/velocity}}  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Again: $doc.fullName  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0outputs:  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Dashboard.WebHome  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Again: $doc.fullName  \n16:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so the answer is no :)  \n16:42\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0same as I posted above, just using this code ( http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/List+Children+Of+Current+Document )  \n16:42\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0under For XWiki Syntax 2.0  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok got it  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0iamcorbin: you were adding the velocity gadget and as its content you were using {{velocity}}....  \n16:45\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0correct, that removing the surrounding {{velocity}}...{{/velocity}} tags fixed the problem  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok problem solved  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n16:46\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0no thank you  \n16:46\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0but I do still have another question. I am trying to figure out velocity code by starting with trying to understand how that snippet I posted works, but I can't find those calls in the API so I'm not sure where to look  \n16:47\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0starting with \"#macro\" and \"createDocumentTree\"  \n16:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0#macro is velocity syntax itself, not really API  \n16:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0see http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html  \n16:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what is the complete call with createDocumentTree ?  \n16:48\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0oh, I thought velocity was Xwiki specific that helps  \n16:48\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0#macro(createDocumentTree $document $depth $level)  \n16:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok so #macro is used to define a velocity macro you can then call in another code, sort of method without a return  \n16:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0createDocumentTree will be the name of the macro  \n16:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so after this you can calls #createDocumentTree($document, $depth, $level)  \n16:50\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0ok cool, that apache page will help  \n16:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you probavaly have it if you do a search  \n16:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\\*probably  \n16:50\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0yeah, it's in the last line  \n16:53\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0thanks, time to do some studying now that I have a better idea of what's going on now. I'm really liking Xwiki so far and appreciate this helpful community!  \n16:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0always nice to hear :)  \n17:00\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0in case you are interested, I'm using it with a friend I went to college with who has a consulting business in Chicago (I just moved to Grand Rapids, MI and am starting my own consulting business here) and he just set it up on his local network that I vpn into through a windows7 virtual machine (I run Ubuntu). He is getting swamped with work and is going to start subcontracting stuff to me and we are going to use Xwiki as a place to  \n17:00\u00a0<iamcorbin>\u00a0organize client information and consulting resources  \n17:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0guys, regarding the diff issue, it seems I am unable to delete selected version range  \n17:02\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0hmm... seems that on a fresh page works, but not working with Main.WebHome.
