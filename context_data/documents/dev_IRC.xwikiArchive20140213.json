Now I have a wiki on which I would like to update this extension, but I don't manage to see an update proposed in the EM UI...  \n17:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I search extensions, I can find xwiki macro - pdf viewer  \n17:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0it says \"functionallites\" ludovic:xwiki-macro-pdfviewer  \n17:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0but I don't see it as an upgrade  \n17:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0actually, I \u00a0think I had this problem before, and it was a bug that was fixed in the mean time... but I am on version 5.2.1  \n18:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: it's not a bug  \n18:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the updater only search ids  \n18:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's because it's impossible to search for anything else than id in a maven repository so for now the API only contains what works for all kind of repositories  \n18:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have to search for the new one and it will replace the one you have currently  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now about xwiki.extension.features in parent will work but it does not make any sense for me  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0parent is supposed to have several children or then it's useless and I doubt you want to have several different extension exposing the same features  \n18:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0locally the WCAG tests fail on me ... anyone else ?  \n18:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: the alias not being found as an upgrade is a bug, XWIKI-9808  \n18:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0(I remember because I reported it)  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: it's not the same thing  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-9808 is not about the updater  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's that you get a install button instead of a upgrade button  \n18:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, never mind my \u00a0validation issues, it is because my admin has some odd subscriptions on his profile page  \n18:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the fact that the updater does not find your extension is completely different and supporting it is a new feature, not a bugfix  \n18:16\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne: it's the same case, I know that there was a nuance on that issue, but I am talking about the same thing as I was talking then  \n18:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0no, not the updater. When I search the extension by it's new name, it appears as a new extension, although I have the old version installed  \n18:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0that's what I meant  \n18:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I remember the nuance  \n18:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0and this is XWIKI-9808, iirc  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok then yes it's XWIKI-9808  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I missread you first messages I guess  \n18:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I might have expressed them badly also  \n18:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's UI bug, if you click on install it will ugrade it  \n18:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0:)  \n18:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0it's just that you don't click on the button because you're afraid of what will happen  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n18:23\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm strange the rendering build is flickering for me  \n18:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it constantly fails but at different places whenever I run it  \n18:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Hi devs, how can I create a new document from a template in Velocity (I tested CopyDocument but it didn't copy the Object from the template)?  \n18:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it didn't copy the object ?  \n18:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sounds like a bug to me  \n18:58\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Maybe I didn't do it right  \n18:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I use DocumentReference for copyDocument function  \n18:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Is it right?  \n18:59\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it should  \n18:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Should I save something?  \n18:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Or the copyDocument should be enough  \n19:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it should be enough  \n19:01\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0At least, copyDocument is the right way to do?  \n19:02\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0recently had some trouble with downgrading, had to remove some extensions etc. now i'm missing the tools to list users/groups and edit them  \n19:10\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0is that part of an extension i'm missing or are the permissions probably screwed up for my user  \n19:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0looks to me like missing pages  \n19:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0where are the \"tools to list users\" gone amiss exactly ?  \n19:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tekzilla: which version ?  \n19:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tekzilla: in a subwiki ?  \n19:15\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0gdelhumeau: 5.4 now, its the main wiki  \n19:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok  \n19:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I know there was a bad commit in 5.3  \n19:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but in 5.4, nothing that I know  \n19:15\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0ok so if the main UI is installed correctly, i should see the users and groups  \n19:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes  \n19:16\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0alright thanks, i'll see whats wrong with it  \n19:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok  \n19:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0good evening guys  \n19:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tekzilla: you might check how your XWiki.AdminUsersSheet is doing  \n19:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if I remove that page, indeed the corresponding section in the admin is gone  \n20:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:18\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0ClemensR: thank you very much for checking that! that might help out alot  \n20:18\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0i'll have to check it out later  \n20:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok. anyway, I hope it really helps  \n20:32\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:48\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:50\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:19\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:22\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:51\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n23:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
