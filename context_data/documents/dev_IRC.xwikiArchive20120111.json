I didn't know if the new \"create\" form was added on purpose or it is a mistake.

I doubt it.  \n08:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0in my case the link leads me to /bin/create/SomeSpace/SomeUnexistingPage  \n08:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0which displays a \"Create\" button  \n08:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and if I click this button I'm taken to edit mode  \n08:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It does go to /create/, but there's no button, it redirects to edit automatically  \n08:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm, are you sure you don't have local changes?

execute on the genertaed XDOM  \n14:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0right, but what does wiki=false mean?  \n14:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0as a parameter?  \n14:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0shouldn't it prevent stuff to happen?  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: it mean it does not parse it  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. it's a plain text  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and not whatever the current syntax is  \n14:39\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0ok, I might see technically what it means  \n14:39\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I mean it might make sense technically  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so basically it parse it with plain/1.0 parser  \n14:39\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0but as usage, you cannot expect anyone to understand that  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well you need to look at the doc for the \"wiki\" parameter  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to check if it's correct  \n14:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0it's really really hard to understand what is the difference between the two  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't mean it's not generating wiki syntax  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it means the content is not considered wiki syntax  \n14:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0right  \n14:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I see.. but it's really hard  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the result should be the same, what wrong IMO is actually to have a verbatimblock since it just supposed to mean that the text inside {{{ }}} should not
