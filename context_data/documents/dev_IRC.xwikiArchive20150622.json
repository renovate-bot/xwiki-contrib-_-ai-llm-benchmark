After import the pages have error in them. Missing macros. etc. I will link to a screenshot  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0cool I can create a doc in a nested space (using a velocity script) and then access it from the URL :) first step!  \n16:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the standard import UI is not great for error reporting...  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0Enygma`: cool that you're taking XWIKI-12229 ;)  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0once this issue is fixed we'll be able to create nested spaces docs from the UI (by typing directly the URL)  \n16:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: hah, actually I read it too quickly and confused it with the create UI :)  \n16:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but it should be related still  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes this one has to be done for 7.2M1 while the UI counterpart could be done for M2  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now indeed, we can consider thy're related ;) still good you're taking it :)  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: do we have a jira for modifying Add Page/Add Space?  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0apparently not  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cannot see it in http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/NestedSpaces  \n16:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0no, am creating one now  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I saw the create action issue and thought that was it :D  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so is there a conclusion about the create space UI? Are we dropping it and presenting only documents?  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0or it's still unclear?  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unclear  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0awesome  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone (you?) need to make us converge  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0even better! :)  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0haven't seen anyone against dropping add space so far  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but there could eb  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not veryone has expressed their opinion  \n16:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0well, nobody is saying it directly, but indirectly there is still friction  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's important that for all design decisions we do them in M1  \n16:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0NS vs ND  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is a bit different  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0dropping add space could be done even now possibly  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes we need to start deciding about what ND means compared to NS (in the UI)  \n17:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yeah, because IMO, dropping the create space UI is what makes the difference between NS and ND, since you can`t just drop the add UI without dropping the differentiated display of pages and spaces  \n17:03\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0tmortagne: http://i.imgur.com/PvmjHMT.png http://i.imgur.com/62OsoGG.png  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0quanttrom: this screenshot sounds like missing translation document, how does the import error looks like exactly ?  \n17:04\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you get a list of failing page or a big error ?  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/page/pages/  \n17:05\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0no failing page. no error. Just a list of pages that were successfully imported  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0quanttrom: you told me that you where getting error during import  \n17:07\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Hi. I've got a problem where I try to hit a page (Admin's preferences page... trying to toggle hidden documents) and xwiki just kills itself, no log message, nothing...  \n17:07\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Is there a way to set verbose logging on all levels?  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0eromano: it's not going to help you much I think since it's going to be so verbose that whatever you find search will be totally drowned  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/find search/search/  \n17:08\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0tmortagne: \u00a0the error is show in the screenshot. It says \"Importing software home.xar: Error while importing\" but no errors listed below  \n17:08\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0http://i.imgur.com/lidvRBD.png  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha sorry I clicked on the second screenshot and did not even saw the first one that was just there...  \n17:09\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0tmortagne: what would you suggest I do next  \n17:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0eromano: if you suspect something in particular, you might try http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Logging+Application and enable detailed logging there.  \n17:10\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Yeah, I'm not sure where the problem would be, though... I tried enabling a few modules, but nothing.  \n17:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0are you sure it`s not a JVM crash?  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0eromano: the JVM is completely killed without anything ?  \n17:11\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0I'll reproduce it one more time, but yes, that's what it looks like.  \n17:11\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0(It's when I go to Admin's profile, and attempt to edit the page in any form)  \n17:12\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0object editor, page editor, etc... and it's when I click on edit - I can't get to the page at all  \n17:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0quanttrom: enabling debug log in com.xpn.xwiki.web.ImportAction might give more details or what is this error about, see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Logging+Application for how to enabled debug log on some class/logger  \n17:13\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0tmortagne: will look into it right now. thanks  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but if all the document are listed as imported it's probably some minor issue  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now for http://i.imgur.com/62OsoGG.png on which page was this screenshot taken ?  \n17:17\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0main page  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the screenshot seems to suggest that the page WikiManager.Translations is missing or has been saved with a user not having expected rights  \n17:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0eromano: What JVM are you using? If there's a bug in the JVM, it`s outside of our control. Try using a diferent JVM, preferably Oracle's.  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0quanttrom: did you restared since your import ?  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue with one bug XAR is that pages can be imported in any order and some pages require some other at the moment they are created  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that might be your issue here  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example translation document need to have as author author a user which have admin right in this translation case  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a restart will fix all that  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if that's the issue  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sorry I have to go, good luck  \n17:22\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks !  \n17:22\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0I appreciate your help ! :)  \n17:24\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:31\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@evalicar: regarding the support drop for IE8/9, how does it affect extensions, e.g. http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/IDEAS-37 ?  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/evalicar/evalica  \n17:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I commented on the issue  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but but...  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commenting  \n17:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I don't know\u2026 the conclusion was that we don't fix the issues in priority, but we didn't agree to close them as Won't fix, since the usage is still good  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commented  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commented again  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I believe your comment was not correct :)  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you agree?  \n17:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0yes - I was looking at the pom too  \n17:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0you are right \u2026 we cannot close issues on extensions on browser support agrement  \n17:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0until they change dependency or case by case  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could say that once an extension requires XWiki 7.0+ then it can drop support of IE8/9  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WDYT?  \n17:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0yes  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok adding to the brwoser support page  \n17:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ty  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I hope everyone agrees :)  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea, tm   \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`, gdelhumeau  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0agreed?  \n17:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0+1  \n17:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sounds legit  \n18:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0makes sense  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k cool  \n18:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0though there is also the case when an extension does not have to actually do anything to \"upgrade\" to 7.0+ but no longer wants to support IE8/9. It would be a decision of the individual extension to drop support and move forward, following XE, but without introducing a technical limitation through some dependency.  \n18:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so we can also decide for some (/most/all) extensions to just make the step, without adding any dep.  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a contrib extension can do whatever it wants  \n18:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0exactly  \n18:04\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so it can drop support even \\*before\\* it requires some feature available only in XE 7.0+  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're just talking about suggesstions of best practices here  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it can even have bugs :)-  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or not work)  \n18:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yep  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll reword a bit  \n18:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0well, once it does depend on 7.0+ and important bugs need to be backported, then I guess it will need to use a bugfix branch as well.  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no need to reword  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have used \"should\" which I think is good enough  \n18:22\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:41\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:01\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:39\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:39\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:55\u00a0<quanttrom>\u00a0hello, I am trying to import a XAR file that is 46MB.
