In window title, you get the html in text output  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:12): [Vincent Massol] (when you use html in titles)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:12): [tmortagne] then the plain text renderer is not used  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:12): [Vincent Massol] ok it's something else then  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:12): [tmortagne] it's not a plain text renderer bug  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:13): [Vincent Massol] do you remember if we have a jira ofr it thomas?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:13): [tmortagne] no, i don't even remember this issue actually  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:13): [Vincent Massol] hmm I was sure we talked about it here or on the list  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:13): [Vincent Massol] (and I even thought you were taking care of it ;))  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:14): [Vincent Massol] hoani.cross: for https://pf.globotraders-tahiti.com/kiaora-ng/bin/view/Photos/ have you used the photo album app as is or have you had to modify it?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:14): [hoani.cross] photo album app delivered but somewhat modified to support i18n  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:15): [hoani.cross] my real problem is the blog app  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:15): [hoani.cross] mostly because it's xwiki1.0 syntax mostly  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:15): [Vincent Massol] ok so that's fixed already  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:16): [hoani.cross] and to properly support i18n, I created 4 blogs (one per language)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:16): [hoani.cross] since object do not have (yet?) i18n fields  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:16): [Vincent Massol] yes it's not there for objects  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:16): [Vincent Massol] several blogs is the good solution  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:16): [Vincent Massol] it's actually possibly better than a single blog  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:17): [Vincent Massol] since you may not always have translations available for all blog posts  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:17): [Vincent Massol] and most of the time you wouldn't want to see untranslated entries  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:17): [hoani.cross] yes and because different languages are associated to different cultures, no all populations cares about all blog posts  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:17): [Vincent Massol] yep  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:18): [hoani.cross] I saw that advantage and used it to sell the fact to my client (the presence of 4 blogs)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:18): [hoani.cross] but I get trouble with images to be included in the blog panel when I use them in summaries  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:19): [hoani.cross] coz it's xwiki1.0, on a xwiki2.0 doc, i get {{html}}... displayed in the blog panel  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:19): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: i found http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XAADMINISTRATION-51 but it's fixed and i checked, by default the plain text renderer is used for head title  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:19): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: do you know what XE version it corresponds to?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:20): [tmortagne] searching  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:20): [Vincent Massol] seraching too  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:20): [Vincent Massol] seems qiute old  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:20): [hoani.cross] one more thing, tags are NOT i18n and it's impossible to dedicated tags to one language, right  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:20): [hoani.cross] ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:20): [tmortagne] pretty sure it's not included in 2.0.2  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:21): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: it is  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:21): [Vincent Massol] 2.0.2 uses 1.18  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:21): [Vincent Massol] (according to http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise202)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:21): [tmortagne] yes it seems  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:22): [Vincent Massol] hoani.cross: hmmm right  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:22): [tmortagne] note the code is in XWikiPreferences  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:22): [Vincent Massol] ah  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:22): [tmortagne] so maybe a upgrade issue or it simply has been chganged  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:22): [Vincent Massol] hoani.cross: could you check that?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:23): [hoani.cross] I change my xwiki window title bar to '$tdoc.displayTitle - $msg.get(\"kiaora.website.title\")' and now look at the result on https://pf.globotraders-tahiti.com/kiaora%2Dng/bin/view/Accommodation/ for example  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:23): [tmortagne] you should have  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:23): [tmortagne] $tdoc.getRenderedTitle(\"plain/1.0\") ($doc.fullName) - XWiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:23): [tmortagne] ok that's why then  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:23): [tmortagne] $tdoc.displayTitle peoduce html  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:23): [tmortagne] produce  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:24): [hoani.cross] you rulez  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:24): [hoani.cross] it works  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:24): [hoani.cross] in japanese too, :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:24): [tmortagne] :)  \nxwiki-bridge left at 13:31 (  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 13:32  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 13:45  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 13:49  \nxwiki-bridge left at 14:57 (  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 14:57  \nxwiki-bridge left at 15:15 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 16:07  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 16:11  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 16:28  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:48  \nKermitTheFragger left at 18:33 (\"Leaving\"  \narkub left at 19:18 (Read error: 113 (No route to host)  \nlucaa left at 21:10 (\"Leaving.\"  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 22:05  \nCalebJamesDeLisl joined #xwiki at 23:23  \n\n"}
