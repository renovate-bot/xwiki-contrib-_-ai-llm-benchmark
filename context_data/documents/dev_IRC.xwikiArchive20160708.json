WDYT? Could be an improvement for after 8.2 if it's risky  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it requires some update to the tour app which may not support this use case?  \n09:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: we cannot do that - we tried, there is a bug http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/TOUR-33  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Small detail: I'd use \"breadcrumb'\" and not \"breadcrumbs\" since I think we refer to it as the \"breadcrumb\"  \n09:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: the pattern is using plural, see http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/Breadcrumbs  \n09:44\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Bootstrat tour does not support the display/highlight of multiples elements in the same step. I can use a selector like #leftPanels, #rightPanels but then will end up with both panel sections highlighted, each of them having own description (which will be duplicated information in page)  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so we need to fix this first. Maybe then modify the text to mention left and right panels  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: I've checked wikipedai and they use both. I'v never heard us use plural  \n09:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well in the story of Hansel and Gretel :) they use multiple :)  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because they are bread crumbs  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not bbreadcrumb which doesn't meant bread crumbs ;)  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my point  \n09:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well it's the base story for the pattern  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that I don't see why we'd document something with a different name from the one we sue  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*use  \n09:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0because it's the standard one  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who's the authority on that?  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see as much singular than plural  \n09:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well regarding UIX I gave you a link, I can find multiple books using plural when talking about the pattern  \n09:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0\\*UX  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually your links says somethinge lse  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0quoting:  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\" The breadcrumb at linux.com describes the depth of the hierachy you have indulged in.\"  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it says breadcrumbs plural in the title because it's talking generically  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\" \u2022 The label of the current page is at the end of the breadcrumb and is not linked.  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I don't agree with you  \n09:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices/  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this pages talks about sinfaulr  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0singular  \n09:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0breadcrumb = one element in the breadcrumbs control  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0did you read what I pasted?  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"\u00a0The breadcrumb at http://linux.com/\u00a0describes the depth of the hierachy you have indulged in.\"  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is not about a single element  \n09:49\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0Hello everybody ! Is someone can help me with http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13348 ?  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0second link you just ggave  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0What is a breadcrumb? https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/breadcrumbs-in-web-design-examples-and-best-practices/#what-is-a-breadcrumb  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"A \u201cbreadcrumb\u201d (or \u201cbreadcrumb trail\u201d) is a type of secondary navigation scheme that reveals the user\u2019s location in a website or Web application\"  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so no you're wrong apparently :)  \n09:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0out text say: \"Breadcrumbs\" - correct; \"The breadcrumbs allow you to identify where your page is located and navigate the hierarchy.\" - correct  \n09:50\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the two links you gave me just prove what I said  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fun :)  \n09:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0so not sure what is the problem  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the right term is singular when you talk about the control  \n09:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0no  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you talk about the various single elements of the breadcrumb then you can use plural  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the overall control is singular  \n09:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you never use just \"breadcrumb\" because it does not make sense. What you can use is \"breadcrumb navigation\" (i.e. breadcrumb-based navigation) or \"breadcrumb trail\" (i.e. a trail of multiple breadcrumbs). In both cases, it is always about a multitude of breadcrumbs (i.e. multiple breadcrumb elements). To simplify, we could use \"breadcrumbs\", but never just \"breadcrumb\".  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I've just quoted from Caty's links :)  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"A \u201cbreadcrumb\u201d (or \u201cbreadcrumb trail\u201d) is a type of secondary navigation scheme\u00a0that reveals the user\u2019s location in a website or Web application\"  \n09:53\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0I find very strange that the issue mentioned above doesn't appear in JIRA's 'my open issues'  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I'm going to stop here. Just know that I prefer breadcrumb because that's what we've always use and there's enough litterature to see that it's not wrong  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus-: hi  \n09:54\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0hi vmassol  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed that would be strange :)  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding the issue hte best person to help you with is Caleb who wrote this porter  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(cjd here when he's online)  \n09:55\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0Yes I know, and there is a thread on the ML but I can't get a clear answer  \n09:55\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0So I'm open to any workaround at this point  \n09:58\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0I've just assigned the issue to Caleb :)  \n09:58\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0even if I don't like to assign issue to anyone myself  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not a good practice ;)  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better to ping him or send a mail on the list  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he'll see it if he has time  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not it means he doesn't have the time to work on this  \n09:59\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0...  \n10:00\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0well.  \n10:01\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:01\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n10:01\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0I just ping him, again  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on the list?  \n10:02\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0directly and on the list  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's really bad form to ping people directly  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:(  \n10:04\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0vmassol, I'm not perfect, I had a glitch this time sorry about it  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reason I mentioned it is just for you to know  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically you get free product and free support but at least the devs should be able to decide if and when they want to respond (since this is done for free). For guaranteed response, there are professional services. that's the logic.  \n10:08\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:08\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0I know, I know. this being said I havent been rude either  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no you're not :)  \n10:09\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0I'm waiting for an answer since April so... Well... I'm a bit stuck  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I understand  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could go back to DB mode  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0remove the attachments  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0switch to FS mode  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and attach them agian  \n10:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n10:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0vmassol, the point is I need to extract the attachments from the DB to have in on disk, nothing can do that but the FS porter  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I said would work  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just redious  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*tedious  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the point of the porter is to make it less tedious :)  \n10:17\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0well, tedious is not the word when you have to move 5Go of image and documents :)  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK people have had success with it in the past so I don't know why it's failing now for oyu  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in that case it's not really practicable  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't have a solution sorry. Someone (you?) need to read the porter script, debug it and fix the problem if any  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whoever that person is must spend some time do it  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if this is urgent and business-related, I can suggest that you contact xwiki sas (http://xwiki.com). They offer professional services and they probably give you a quote for doing it for you  \n10:19\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0vmassol, well I've tried and spent time on reading, but it's a bit harsh to me and I'm almost sure I would take no more than 10min for Caleb to tell me what I should do/fix in the code  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n10:19\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0I'm going to try agazin  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see what he says when he's availa  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*available  \n10:20\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0and about pro support, we stopped it some time ago, and the \"money\" is now spent on the RT editor (if you don't know this yet :P )  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@acotiuga: re the restart tour button  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:21\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0we decided to stop the pro support because... most of the time we can get ourself fixed on our own  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus-: ah ok, no didn't know you're part of this :)  \n10:21\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0vmassol: WDYM ?  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would have been useful in this case :)  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acotiuga: it restarts at the last step  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not the first one)  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"would have been useful in this case \" was for martinus-  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n10:23\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0vmassol, \"maybe\" :)  \n10:24\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0enough talk, now I get into the code once again :)  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry, I don't have the time to dive into this code myself. Good luck and let's hope caleb will be available soon  \n10:26\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0yep , thanks vmassol  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea1: we might need to mention in the RN of CK/XWiki that the users needs to force refresh their browser cache if they install the CKEditor extension. I've just done it and it was failing by default until I refreshed my cache  \n10:28\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0vmassol, just you to know, the pro support once told us that only the extensions with \"XWiki Development Team\" as author were supported ...  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure, it depends what support you take though  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and what extensions we're talking about  \n10:28\u00a0<martinus->\u00a0vmassol, so if the author is Caleb, it's not namely the \"XWiki Development Team\"  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this one is developed by someone from xwiki sas  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's possible to support it IMO  \n10:29\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0vmassol: sure, we can, but that's true for any extension that has js (as long as you had a previous version installed and as long as we don't version the resource URLs)  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's an extension developed by someone else from the community it's harder and would cost me  \n10:30\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0right now clearing the browser cache is mandatory after an XWiki upgrade  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea1: I know, just rtying to find ways to make it slightly easier for users.

 \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIR we said we didn't want this in the past  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any reason we're changing this?  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(actually we even have an issue open to keep the non-normalized content in the future if we can)  \n11:52\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0the reason is that both the wiki editor and the wysiwyg editors are \"XDOM editors\", so they get as input an XDOM  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see\u2026. hmmm  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that probably need a vote/proposal on the list I'd say, it's not a very small thing  \n11:53\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0the main reason for this was to be able to associate editors to data types  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, I understand  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we coudl associate with String no?  \n11:54\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0sure  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(instead of XDOM)  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you associate with string you can't have plain text editor  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep so we have to decide what we prefer  \n11:55\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0tmortagne: why?  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you save the content always been normalized anyway so I don't really see the issue  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I don't like is that this generates spurious diffs  \n11:55\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0it's not normalized, it's saved as is  \n11:55\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0(because you can write bad syntax)  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: only for wysiwyg not wiki  \n11:56\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0and we need to preserver that bad syntax as is  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha you are talking about wiki editor, I missed that part  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the issue is only technical we could have another object wrapping a String for the wiki editor  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WikiContent for example  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would just hold a String  \n11:58\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0my implementation allows use to have categories of editors for a data type. For XDOM we have Text and WYSIWYG categories. Moreover it support subcategories. So we could have String data type with \"Wiki Syntax\" categories, and Text and Wysiwyg as subcagories  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok even better then :)  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd be in favor of not changing the wiki editor behavior at least not now in RC1  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can open a dsicussion for that  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I fear we may not want to normalize  \n12:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would really prefer a more descriptive type than String  \n12:00\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0we could keep the XDOM editor for when we want to get an editor for XDOM, and use string for edit mode  \n12:01\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0it's like the same editor would implement multiple roles, Editor<XDOM> and Editor<String>  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we can easily use a wrpaping object if need be such as WikiContent if thomas doesn't like String  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(doesn't like = have something more descriptive)  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WikiContent, WikiText, etc  \n12:04\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0or WikiMarkup https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\\_markup  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n12:05\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0but I'm fine with WikiContent or WikiText  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0WikiMarkup sounds more \"standard\"  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm also fine with WikiMarkup.
