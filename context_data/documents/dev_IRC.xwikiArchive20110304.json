It's fragile and a bit of a hack to provide smooth transition but it becomes complex with deleted attachments where one might ask for all deleted attachments for a given document. WDYT?  \n11:50\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0The alternative is a groovy script which moves attachments over.  \n11:51\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0And I think that is safer too since the user will never be deleting anything from the db unless they are switched to db attachment mode.  \n11:51\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:52\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:56\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:58\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:12\u00a0<Stulle|Workstati>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:14\u00a0<qwebirc91216>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n12:17\u00a0<qwebirc91216>\u00a0has quit  \n12:19\u00a0<ralucaM>\u00a0has quit  \n12:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:35\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Just built xwiki-core with forkMode commented out and <argLine>-Xmx128M</argLine>  \n12:35\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Apparently that memory leak was fixed for maven3.  \n12:36\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0mvn -o clean install  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03.0.3?  \n12:36\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0[INFO] Total time: 1:10.538s  \n12:36\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Apache Maven 3.0.1-SNAPSHOT (rNON-CANONICAL\\_2010-10-04\\_23-13\\_user; 2010-10-04 23:13:29-0400)  \n12:41\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Another thing, you can get a massive speed increase by building WYSIWYG threaded.  \n12:42\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Maybe not safe enough to release that way but I would do it for CI.  \n12:53\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:06\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0Hi all  \n13:07\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0Maybe not on the right channel but I have a access rights related question ...  \n13:07\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0I want to have a space viewable by everyone, but editable only by people in a group  \n13:08\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0when I change the access rights of the space (set edit permission on my group), non logged users seems to have no more the right to simply view the page ...  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gsauthier:  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's normal  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when no rights is set for a given permissions it means it's allowed  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(allowed for everyone)  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you click on edit for a given group  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you need to also set it to all other users who need it  \n13:10\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0ohhh, so, if I uncheck the view permission for my group it should work ?  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/users/groups/  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you don't have it set for any group it'll work  \n13:11\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0Yeah, that works !!  \n13:11\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0thanks vincent  \n13:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n13:13\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0Cool, we now have group security on the OW2 TC pages :) http://www.ow2.org/view/TechnologyCouncil/  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n13:15\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0I really like much more the new XWiki (2.x) than pre 1.0 :) So much improvements !!!  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0glad you like it :)  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03.0 is around the corner too  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(well the first version of it)  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as always  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:19\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0I just had some issues with blogs: somehow, in ow2, the old blog classes (XWiki.ArticleClass) are still in use where we should use Blog.BlogPostClass ...

I found a problem I will report, fix, close. These last a day. 2. User doesn't like something complains; hard problem, api break needed or nobody considers it worth fixing but nobody wishes to claim it is frivolous and close as \"won't fix\", these sit on the tracker forever.  \n14:32\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: see my last tweets on http://twitter.com/vmassol  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting the move of observation-api  \n14:44\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Yup. When the data is peaked on the low and high ends a good trick is to compare the mean to the median. If the median is lower then you are doing well, if higher then you are losing.

Like the idea of a cooperative blacklisting service where multiple sites can participate in excluding spam and scraper ips. 1 central service which serves a tiny niche.  \n15:49\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Web services which are primarily consumed by other servers.  \n15:49\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0(That's probably just one application)  \n15:52\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0cjdelisle: we share similar thinking, i gotta hack some ruby scripts to be called from fail2ban/snort as per this: http://securitysauce.blogspot.com/2009/05/ip-blacklisting-for-snort-2841.html#c3708470947841333777  \n15:53\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0one of my tasks for my day-off / journee repos if i ever find the damn time!  \n15:54\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0this is ridiculous, everyone I know has some sort of blacklisting system on their box. It is probably the most clear case for choreography right now.  \n15:54\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0it's already been done and commercialized per se, but there's not really a widespread defacto community standard implementation out-of-the-box that one can just apt/yum/pacman to install  \n15:55\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0it would certainly be a great tool against all -ve net behaviour out there - boxes attacked post, meanwhile auto-blacklists subscribe to the hashtag  \n15:56\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0What I'm thinking is: too many page loads too fast --> redirect to a captcha.  \n15:57\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0maybe, an algo that takes that and other data and decides whether to jail the IP or not even better  \n15:57\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0As a webmaster you subscribe to whatever level of page loads per minute per ip you want and users will be blocked for you when they pull more than that number of pages from anyone.  \n15:57\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0(from any subscriber)  \n15:57\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0That means a web bug  \n15:58\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:58\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0someone's probably done that as an apache plugin  \n15:58\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0And the web bug creates a cryptographic token in each link and all you (the webmaster) need to do is validate the token when you get a hit. If the validation fails you redirect to the blacklisting server.  \n15:59\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Blacklisting server checks the ip and if they are not listed then it redirects them back (double redirect for people with js turned off)  \n16:00\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0It might be made faster with dns magic but dns is dangerous, mistakes take a couple days to clear out.  \n16:02\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0for now i'd be just happy with box being able to post to statusnet and subscribe to hashtag and auto-ban, thereafter one might evolve it further  \n16:02\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0hashtag is a bit like a p2p tracker  \n16:03\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe recycle bittorrent tracker tech.  \n16:03\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0cjdelisle: don't suppose you know the script that tells me orphans of users not in groups, excluding xwiki-all per chance?  \n16:04\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0users who are in no group hmm  \n16:06\u00a0<nuvolari\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n16:12\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0$xwiki.searchDocuments(\", BaseObject as user, BaseObject as group, BaseProperty as member where user.name = doc.fullName and user.className = 'XWiki.XWikiUsers' and group.className = 'XWiki.XWikiGroups' and group.name != 'XWiki.XWikiAllGroup' and member.id = group.id and member.value = doc.fullName and member.name = 'member'\")  \n16:12\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I think  \n16:19\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n16:20\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0i wonder if anyone's created an eclipse plugin for hacking xwiki velocity code to avoid common typo pitfalls  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I have to leave for a while\u2026. next step will be to move shared tests to commons  \n16:24\u00a0<jbrBridg1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:25\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0has quit  \n16:26\u00a0<nuvolari\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<jbrBridg1>\u00a0is now known as <jbrBridge>  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:19\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:25\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:35\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok to rename hared-tests in xwiki-common-tests in common?  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0+1  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\"shared-test\" was not a very good name  \n18:57\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:47\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:16\u00a0<Stulle|Workstati>\u00a0has quit  \n20:16\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:16\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan`>  \n20:31\u00a0<nuvolari>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:58\u00a0<nuvolari\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n21:24\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n21:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:22\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:01\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:05\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0is now known as <npm>  \n23:24\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
