If I enter \"{{velocity}}#floatingbox(\"Test-text\"){{/velocity}}\" as xwiki code, the result ends up being html code.  \n18:20\u00a0<xwikinewb>\u00a0Am I missing some step?  \n18:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, also add {{html}} ... {{/html}} \u00a0around the complete thing  \n18:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0by default output generated by the velocity gets interpreted as wiki syntax (and html escaped in the fitrst place)  \n18:24\u00a0<xwikinewb>\u00a0Ah, it worked with a minor change. I used them in the order \"{{velocity}}{{html}}...{{/html}}{{/velocity}}\"  \n18:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwikinewb: you can also use {{box cssClass=\"floatinginfobox\" title=\"\\*\\*Contents\\*\\*\"}}Test-text{{/box}} instead of mixing velocity and html  \n18:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0#floatingbox is a bit old and written when the default syntax was a mix of velocity and html by default  \n18:25\u00a0<xwikinewb>\u00a0how would I go about to find out about those useful macros? :)  \n18:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Box+Macro for the box macro and the \"floatinginfobox\" is simple the same css class used by #floatingbox  \n18:26\u00a0<xwikinewb>\u00a0ok.
