Would be good to add a warning to the release notes saying that starting with 4.2M3 you need to dynamically lookup the hidden document filter in singleton components.  \n10:38\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0mflorea: indeed  \n11:00\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0jvdrean: one alternative to componentManager.getInstance(QueryFilter.class, \"hidden\") would be to keep the declarative @Inject section, but use Provider<QueryFilter> filterProvider; instead of QueryFilter filter;  \n11:01\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0then you just use filterProvider.get();  \n11:01\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0this way you avoid working with/depending on the component manager  \n11:02\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: which of the 2 options should we advertise as the best practice? If I remember correctly, it should be the Provider way, right?  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otp  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0provider is to be used when you need to get the instance lazily  \n11:04\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and if the component changes instantiation method in the meanwhile from PER\\_LOOKUP to SINGLETON, the Provider will return the singleton, right?  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check GenericProvider implementation to see the algo  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one very important thing to remember is that ATM a runtimeexcption is thrown if not found so caller need to know this  \n11:08\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it seems to use componentManager.getInstance(...) internally, so this means that the instantiation method will be taken into account  \n11:08\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0yes, it should do the same as my previous example but in a more elegant way  \n11:08\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0I'm updating the RN  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys when can we release M3 now? Can it be done today?  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have an issue in that RC1 is supposed to be release next Monday (17th)...  \n11:43\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0In the Container module, why the Session interface is empty ? should not this interface provide abstraction of a session ?  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis1: yes, it's just not implemented yet  \n11:43\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I just commited a fix on platform for wysiwyg-tests. There is some flickering on selenium-tests. I think we can start the release after the current build is done  \n11:44\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0vmassol: any alternative to keep a object between requests ?  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should we postpone RC1 to Wednesday 19th? And do final on 24th  \n11:45\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: are you sure that is flickering?  \n11:45\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it is failing quite consistently  \n11:45\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis1: right now you'd need to use the servlet context  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: either using the XWikiContext.getEngineContext or using ServletContext directly, ie not going through container. The good alternative is to implement Container Session  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: should we postpone RC1 to Wednesday 19th? And do final on 24th?  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: ?  \n11:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: it doesn't fail locally and I think I've seen this test failing before. I'll double check anyway  \n11:47\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: do you know what the job xwiki-platform-core-site-job is supposed to do?  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: generate the maven site I believe  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(jenkins job right?)  \n11:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: +1, doing the RC on Monday is a bit short  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok sending vote  \n11:48\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0if we do the release today, I think it would be OK to keep RC1 for Monday  \n11:48\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but that`s just my oppinion  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: not much time to test  \n11:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: it fails because it doesn't have enough PermGem. We need to check why.  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: do you still have stuff to commit?  \n11:49\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes, but we also have the RC1-Final window to fix  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(known stuff)  \n11:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: for M3?  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: yes but it's better to fix for RC1 than for fginal  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0final  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0final is supposed to be just a rename of RC  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0theoretically we're not supposed to make any change  \n11:49\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0except bugfixes  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since otherwise it theoretically means a RC2  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not even bugfixe  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bugfixes  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we do that from time to time but it's still not good  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if we have known bugfixes to do  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we shoudl do them for RC1  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: for 4.2  \n11:50\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: not really a good option IMO, since it does not follow the session lifecycle and it will require a \"session\" like isolation. Implementing Session would be nice, but postpone availability too much. Disappointed that the basic session interface was not implemented upfront :(  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: there has been no need so far...  \n11:51\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: the PermGen remark was about the selenium tests or about xwiki-platform-core-site-job ?  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I know there's a need ofc, it just needs to be implemented  \n11:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I would like to work on two thinks (1) display invalid extensions differently (some red marker) and (2) make the upgrade plan live (i.e. update the upgrade plan log which it is build). But I'm not sure how much time I will have because I need to work on portlet integration too  \n11:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: site job  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is the portlet integration work criticial in term of deadlines?  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or could the deadline be pushed so that you focus on ths first?)  \n11:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the deadline is mid September  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hard deadline? :)  \n11:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I could finish this week, which leave me 2-3 days next week for EM  \n11:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I think so, need to check with Thomas and Guillaume  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok would be good if you could get 3-4 days of free time to finish 4.2  \n11:55\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: no, I will cast to servletSession  \n11:55\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not matter of deadline really, I just do not want to depends on 4.2  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: sorry, was talking to marius atually ;)  \n11:57\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: read too fast  \n11:57\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0ie8 and ie9 tests are disabled. Is that normal? Can we do the release without them?  \n11:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: the agents were lost during an uprade of the machine. I will have to re-install them with Alex  \n11:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: yes, they were suppose to run on windows agents, which were removed. We kept the jobs for future, in case we add the agents back. You an ignore them  \n11:58\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0right  \n11:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: check your skype :)  \n12:00\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0ok, so once the current builds are done, I will go ahead with the release process and copy the sources  \n12:01\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0sburjan: sorry, new skype's notfications fault :)  \n12:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:02\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: all selenium tests passed this time  \n12:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I think we can assume it's a flicker (needs to be fix at some point)  \n12:09\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0cool  \n12:10\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0I remember excluding maven-agent3 or vmaven-agent5 from the selenium test before starting it, but I no longer see that in the configuration  \n12:10\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0mflorea: did you clean it?  \n12:10\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0is now known as <Enygma`>  \n12:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0maybe, I did play with that config on a couple of jobs  \n12:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0not in the last few hours though  \n12:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0wierd... anyway, tests pass, that`s good  \n12:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0waiting for the rest of the build...  \n12:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: re Postponing 4.2. I will have only 2 days for testing the RC1. 20 and 21. Because 22 and \u00a023 are in weekend. I won't have the time for a full manual test.  \n12:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I guess postponing for another day is out of the question, right ?  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: start now :)  \n12:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'm busy with 4.1.4 ATM  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not the priority IMO  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0silvia said she could help with 4.1.4  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you can talk to her? (I've had a discussion with her this morning)  \n12:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and she is. she is performing the full manual test and I am checking if the fixedFor 4.1.4 issues are truly fixed. OFC, the ones I can test  \n12:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i have talked with her. this is her proposal I'm writing here  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're already late, we can't postpone more  \n12:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n12:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so core-site-job is still failing with PermGen issues...  \n13:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I still don`t understand what it does and if it is vital for the release or not  \n13:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: don't bother with this job  \n13:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok then  \n13:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0absolutely not vital  \n13:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thanks  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not even supposed to work ATM  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why it has a manual trigger  \n13:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I am trying to run the script ludovic provided,on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-234 \u00a0but I get an error  \n13:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Script12.groovy: 14: Ambiguous expression could be a parameterless closure expression, an isolated open code block, or it may continue a previous statement;  \n13:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0solution: Add an explicit parameter list, e.g. {it -> ...}, or force it to be treated as an open block by giving it a label, e.g. L:{...}, and also either remove the previous newline, or add an explicit semicolon ';' @ line 14, column 1.  \n13:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{groovy}}  \n13:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and I can't figure out what am i doing wrong  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works fine  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just tested it  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as is with no change  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0didn't you had to put {{groovy}} to surround the script ?  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course as it's written in the issue  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I copied exactly as is  \n13:16\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well in the issue I don't see the {{ and }} :)  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0look again  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:16\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I am. realy  \n13:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*realy  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0refresh  \n13:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, works now.

We should still look at fixing those issues ofc  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm guys shouldn't we also publish our releases on dzone?  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(our release announcements)  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've just seen that GateIn 3.4 has been announced there: http://www.dzone.com/links/gatein\\_34\\_is\\_released.html  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll send a vote since I think that's a good idea  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:54\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n17:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:17\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:41\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0I have an issue with XWiki Enterprise 4.1.4 where the WYSIWYG editor just shows a spinner image, rather than the content. I'm having trouble looking in JIRA to see if it's a known issue  \n22:41\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0This is an upgrade from XWiki 3.2, if memory serves  \n22:41\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0I thought it might be related to the locking mechanism -- the return from the Ajax call is 204 - No content  \n22:42\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0But I don't know if that's by design  \n22:42\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0I've tried different browsers on different platforms  \n22:43\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0The simple WIki editor works fine for making changes  \n22:44\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0I installed the XWiki Enterprise UI pages XAR for 4.1.4 and remove the same item from the old version  \n22:44\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0What I haven't done yet is create a new database and import everything to it. I don't know if that's necessary or recommended.  \n22:45\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0I don't see any JavaScript errors in the console or 404's in the request log  \n22:46\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0This is running in Tomcat 7.0.30 container. I tried with/without the native Tomcat library.  \n22:47\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0Nothing especially interesting shows up in the Catalina logs  \n22:52\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0I do see that the IFRAME is loaded with the content to be edited. And if I delete the div.loading that obscures it, I can start typing into that area.  \n22:53\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0However, div.xRichTextEditor div.gwt-MenuBar is empty, but for the full-screen button.  \n22:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:34\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0Well, I installed a standalone copy on my workstation. The WYSIWYG editor works just fine. And I see that the site looks much different. There must be an issue with my upgrade process.  \n23:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n23:51\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0I found the problem. Turns out, I didn't do the XWiki Enterprise UI pages XAR for 4.1.4 import correctly.  \n23:51\u00a0<jlamoree>\u00a0Now it's running like a top.  \n\n"}
