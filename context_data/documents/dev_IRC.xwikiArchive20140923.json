 \n12:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since all descriptors have explicit domain we should have all the required information to generate proper links, we have this issue \"officially\" when there is no main wiki descriptor  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe the url factory wrongly associate the main wiki and the the first URL in the xcontext without even looking at the descriptor in some cases  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you check the watchlist we get every day from xwiki.org  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll see that sometimes when you click the links they're wrong  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they point to the wrong wikis  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't traced why  \n12:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: I want to upgrade jquery for 6.2.1  \n12:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0using webjar  \n12:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n12:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:09\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:35\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, question for you  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to add some debugging logs when we shutdown xwiki  \n13:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sure  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm proposing to use a special logger name for that  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"org.xwiki.shutdown\"  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0private static final Logger SHUTDOWN\\_LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"org.xwiki.shutdown\");  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so any code that wants to log shutdown stuff would use that logger  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this makes it easy to enable all shutdown logs in one go in our log file  \n13:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok from my perspective  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<logger name=\"org.xwiki.shutdown\" level=\"debug\"/>  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so far we've always used full class name and no cross-cutting converns  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*converns  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*concerns  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hence my asking...  \n13:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's not a big deal for me as long as \"org.xwiki.shutdown\" is in every file which uses the logger  \n13:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that way I can search for the string  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess the real question behind this is whether we're prepared to start using cross-cutting logger names  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR here's what I get for now when I enable debug for this logger:  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/61c2d00a0fb965e59b56/raw/3f882a4432986dfb2003130492beee239485522b/gistfile1.txt  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when all goes right)  \n13:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a02014-09-23 13:54:05,735 [Thread-1] DEBUG o.x.shutdown \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Database Connection Pool has been stopped  \n13:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a02014-09-23 13:54:10,514 [Thread-1] DEBUG o.x.shutdown \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Component [org.xwiki.search.solr.internal.DefaultSolrIndexer] has been stopped  \n13:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0uh oh :)  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdym?
