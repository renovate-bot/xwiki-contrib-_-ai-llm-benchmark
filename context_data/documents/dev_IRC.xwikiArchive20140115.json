 \n15:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I think it depends on how rights are defined on the subwiki  \n15:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0guys, do we send e-mails for pull requests made on contrib ?  \n15:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: AFAIK yes  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you're right  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just tested  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0admin right is inherited on subwikis  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0always been like this but I think since 5.0 and the new right system everything is inherited, right Denis ?  \n15:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0tmortagne: is there a way to <exclude> a transient dependency in an extensions.xwiki.org extension?  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: <exclude> is not supported by Extension Manager no  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(i.e. it's not taken into account)  \n15:58\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm I have a websocket app which pulls in nettosphere which pulls in netty and collides with the version of netty in xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not the same id than the one in XWiki or do you require a version more recent than what is currently in the core extensions ?  \n16:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's a more recent version  \n16:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it would not work with a older version ?  \n16:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'd be ok with trying to see if the older version works, I just need to figure out how to exclude the newer version  \n16:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I mean with the version in XWiki  \n16:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0just a matter of figuring out how to make an exclude work in the EM  \n16:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't need to exclude  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just need to change the version you require  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can do that using a dependencyManagement  \n16:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I require nettosphere and nettosphere requires netty  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like we have in commons root pom  \n16:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok, so if I require netty directly using dependencyManagement, it will cause nettosphere to use the correct version?  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you declare something in dependencyManagement it applies to all your dependencies and their dependencies etc  \n16:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and EM is able to work with this?  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n16:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm need to check something  \n16:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it supports it but maybe not in all cases  \n16:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0can I create an object with dependencyManagement on ext.xwiki.org or do I have to release it to a mvn repo and then create a faux extension which pulls it in as a dependency?  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0EM supports it but extensions.xwiki.org does not  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's only suported by maven repository handler  \n16:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok so basically I'm going to have to publish it somewhere in some maven repo (maven.xwiki.org?) and then create a fake extension on extensions.xwiki.org which depends on it  \n16:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0in order to get the functionality  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(there is no such concept in generic extension manager model, it's a \"hack\" in maven handler)  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't you have several jars already ?  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the dependency on netty is on the root one ?  \n16:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0erm  \n16:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the alternative is to upgrade netty on XWiki and say that you require 5.4, unless netty upgrade is dangerous  \n16:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I depend on nettosphere and every somewhat recent version of nettosphere depends on a newer version of netty than xwiki has  \n16:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0or shade, move-dependencies, build a fat jar then go hit the shower  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure the last resort is to deploy your own nettosphere pom.xml with a different version or id  \n16:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0which seems to be the most likely way of reaching my goal by the end of the week  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the quickest  \n16:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0IMO we should review how the extension development process is for a new developer  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now it all depend if nettosphere works with XWiki's netty version  \n16:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if nettosphere declared this dependency there is maybe a reason  \n16:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm going to try the fat jar method just because it seems like the fastest way to somethign that works and every solution has significant risk of roadblock so I'm interested in fast  \n16:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean shade right ?  \n16:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since with a simple fatjar you might have conflicts  \n16:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yes, shading  \n16:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: are you around ?
