I have a 8.0-SNAPSHOT, jetty+hsqldb. Is this normal?  \n10:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: yes, it's not a dependency of XE since XE does not come with any user anymore, you get this extension only in the jetty/hsqldb package in which we install it to avoid having to register a custom user when you start it. I tough it would be a pain for testers but we could decide to get rid of it and always ask for a custom user.  \n10:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, makes sense  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: the cration of the admin user is now on master?

 \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're taking the hard road  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:09\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0lol, \u00a0seemed like the easy one from my perspective at the time  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no wonder you find it a bit hard to set up ;)  \n15:10\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0since i was trying to remove and disable so much of the stuff, it seemed easier to start with nothing and work forward then start with everything and work backward  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n15:10\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0but im sure im not a 'normal' use case either  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's an advanced use case actually  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n15:10\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0yeah, thats kinda what i figured after the fact  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0though we're going to make it a bit simpler with our minimal flavor that we're creating  \n15:11\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0when youre ready for testing, let me know  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'd need to know what minimal is for you  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12978  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's going to be released officially in 8.0 final  \n15:12\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0ive been a follower of xwiki since i discovered it years ago, have tried pushing it on anyone considering confluence; \u00a0its one of the few opensource projects that i know of that actually has \\*more\\* features and work in it than most of its commercial counterparts  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie in less than 2 weeks  \n15:12\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0nice!  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice comment :)  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can I quote you on it?

 \n15:23\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0means that you guys have put more time, energy, and effort into developing the featureset than many of your counterparts  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok got it thanks  \n15:30\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: what's the status on the release?  \n15:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no open issues, no issues without doc, but there is a failing test on platform  \n15:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/lastBuild/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-wiki-test-tests/testReport/org.xwiki.wiki.test.ui/WikiTemplateTest/createWikiFromTemplateTest/  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only one?

 \n18:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol, mflorea: I was currently looking into http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13168 which is about the alternative fix I`ve applied on 7.4.2 (for which apparently I did not handle sheets, or something in that area).  \n18:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m not sure what can be done about XWIKI-13138 since, as long as we don`t also update the context document's wiki reference when we do context.setWikiId(...)  \n18:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we are currently exploiting the fact that some systems need the current wiki set to some value and we are explicitly changing that, without caring about the context doc  \n18:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so they kind of end up being desynchronized  \n18:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so we could either 1) do it automatically in context.setWikiId, 2) fix individual issues by also setting and restoring the context doc when we set the context wiki or 3) revert  \n18:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0doing 1) might result in an invalid context document  \n18:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Enygma` XWiki.updateDatabase(newWikiId) doesn't have a document to put on the context because it starts from an empty database. It could set the context doc to null, nut this doesn't fix the problem because XWikiContext#setDoc as it is not doesn't touch the wiki if the passed doc is null  \n18:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so someone that sets the current doc and then restores the current doc (null) --> will leave the wiki set  \n18:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0setting the current wiki to null is also not really an alternative  \n18:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0i.e. you have currentWiki=foo and currentDoc=null, someone sets currentDoc=bar:A.B then restores the null current doc. This leaves currentWiki=bar  \n18:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: maybe something like DefaultDocumentAccessBridge.pushDocumentInContext/popDocumentFromContext might be better  \n18:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0instead of directly calling xcontext.setDoc(document);  \n18:31\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(note that we would need the DAB version of the push method that accepts an XWikiDocument instance and we would also need for the context backup/restore process to include the current wiki)  \n18:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but the idea would be to not do it by hand, but use a helper instead  \n18:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this would still be valid only 1 way (for setting the context doc)  \n18:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0anyway, for now I think it would just be best to revert and to apply the same intermediary solution  \n18:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and we should come up with the best practice of setting the context wiki whenever we set the context doc (if from a different wiki) and when restoring the context document, we also need to restore the context wiki.  \n19:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:06\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:25\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n20:26\u00a0<cujonz>\u00a0has quit  \n20:30\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:39\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n21:16\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n21:25\u00a0<cujonz>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:06\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
