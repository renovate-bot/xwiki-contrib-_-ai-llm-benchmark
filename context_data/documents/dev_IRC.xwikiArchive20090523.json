Looks like i dont even have rights to create a page, no panel too.  \narunreddy - (23/05/2009 10:06): sdumitriu:It says Error : You are not allowed to view this docuement or perform this action.  \nkaaloo joined #xwiki at 10:56  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 11:02  \narunreddy left at 12:12 (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))  \narunreddy joined #xwiki at 12:15  \ntuska joined #xwiki at 12:42  \narunreddy left at 13:22 (Read error: 113 (No route to host))  \ncristinaS joined #xwiki at 13:57  \narunreddy joined #xwiki at 14:42  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 14:46): Hi vmassol I was thinking about the grails xwiki rendering plugin, there is a radeox plugin that provides a radeoxRender gsp tag. \u00a0A first level of integration would be to do the same and provide an xwikiRender tag.  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 14:48): kaaloo: hi, sounds cool. I still need 1 or 2 days to finish the clean separation.  \ntachirei joined #xwiki at 15:55  \ntachirei left #xwiki at 16:01  \ntharindu\\_ joined #xwiki at 16:07  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 16:17): vmassol: ok I'm ready to go ! \u00a0Can you point me out what the api will look like ? \u00a0I've been looking at xwiki rendering in fisheye but I'm not quite sure where to start.  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:18): kaaloo: I'm almost done on my side too. Here's some quickstart but I'll write more on how to use the xwiki rendernig outside of xiwki when I'm done: http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 16:19): vmassol: great let me see here  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:19): the idea will be to use the EmbeddedContainer to initialize xwiki components: new EmbeddedContainer()  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:19): then you'll use that instance to do your lookups  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:19): then the rest is a described on http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:21): by default you'll run in non wiki mode, i.e no notion of wiki page, attachments, etc. So links for ex are only links to URLs. To enter wiki mode you'll need to provide an implementation of the WikiModel interface (it has 4 methods)  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 16:21): ok so I'll also need a grails XWikiRenderingService that can provide an api for transformation for instance  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 16:29): I'll start out with the xwikiRender tag, there may be some cool things to do with the notion of a grails converter, something like render as PDF or render as Word  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 16:34): Isn't it possible to ask the parser for a Syntax instance instead of creating a new instance (txManager.performTransformations() in the example) ?  \nlucien joined #xwiki at 16:41  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:56): kaaloo: you do ask a parser for a given syntax....  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:56): componentManager.lookup(Parser.class, \"syntax id here\")  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:56): the transformations are something else  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:56): not sure what you want to do  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:57): right now you'll need transformations only to execute macros  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 16:57): (it's optional)  \ntachirei joined #xwiki at 17:01  \ntachirei left #xwiki at 17:28  \ntachirei joined #xwiki at 17:28  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 17:33): ok let's leave macros for later then, but want I want is to obtain a syntax instance from the parser instead of doing a new Syntax(...)  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 17:36): kaaloo: well you can just call Parser.getSyntax() ;)  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 17:36): but what do you need this syntax for?  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 17:37): (you should only need it for transformations)  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 17:39): yes just for transformations, so the example could be updated then, or am I missing something ?  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 17:40): yes  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 17:40): kaaloo: if you can edit that would be cool  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 17:40): s/edit/edit it/  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 17:40): I will  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 17:42): I'm going to implement a WikiPrinter because inside a grails tag you need to print to an output stream, like a jsp tag, does that sound ok to you ?  \nvmassol - (23/05/2009 17:42): yep  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 18:00): ok I have my tag more or less setup, I should grab a jar just to make sure it compiles  \nkaaloo - (23/05/2009 18:01): Now what about this EmbeddedContainer, I need to get a componentManager instance somehow  \ncristinaS left at 18:07 (\"Bersirc 2.2, for external use only.
