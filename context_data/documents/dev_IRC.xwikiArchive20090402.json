But you should not choose a project you don't like at all just because it's less popular  \nlucaa - (02/04/2009 10:51): alexmaru: is your project proposal at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/XWikiWidgetandFirefoxextension inspired from this http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/XWikiCrossPlatformWebandDesktopWidget2009 ?  \nalexmaru - (02/04/2009 10:52): lucaa: yes  \naargre - (02/04/2009 10:52): it's not about things sorting out i am just tired of writing so many proposals  \nalexmaru - (02/04/2009 10:53): those are just some ideas... that i wanted to discuss with the community  \nlucaa - (02/04/2009 10:53): alexmaru: and you haven't submitted your project application to the gsoc page, did you?  \nalexmaru - (02/04/2009 10:53): I hope my final proposal will be bigger and of higher quality  \nalexmaru - (02/04/2009 10:54): lucaa: nope  \nlucaa - (02/04/2009 10:56): alexmaru: well, you should submit it, so we can get an idea about who wants what and a round number of applicants / per project.

We abstract the storage behind interfaces, with different implementations. We do have an experimental JCR storage engine, but the main storage is done with Hibernate on top of a RDBMS  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:29): You should look at http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/store/  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:29): (It's quite messy in there, we're working on refactoring this module)  \ntudor\\_f - (02/04/2009 13:30): thanks; mainly i'm interested on how i could improve the photo gallery's module storage system  \ntudor\\_f - (02/04/2009 13:31): from what i can tell until now, it's simply attachement based with a serialization in the back in a xml file..  \nlucaa - (02/04/2009 13:33): tudor\\_f: I think the serialization you're referring is done only on export. Otherwise it is stored in a database. But as sdumitriu said, through interfaces. So you should not take into account anything more but these interfaces, to guarantee you that all you'll do is usable regardless of the storage engine, I think  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:34): You should not think about this  \ntudor\\_f - (02/04/2009 13:34): yeah, i was wondering why the base64 encoding on the jpg files :)  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:34): The storage is a given, it is not your concern to improve it  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:35): It is bad, but fixing it is a different project  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:35): Which requires a lot of deep knowledge about XWiki  \ntudor\\_f - (02/04/2009 13:37): so i can focus on building a nice & clean user interface on the photo gallery, good to hear that :)  \ntudor\\_f - (02/04/2009 13:49): i've noticed that there's a Lightbox integration module already existing inside the code repository; does that mean there's a Prototype/jQuery/Ext/MooTools and such inclusion snippet somewhere out there?  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:54): The lightbox is not that clean  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:54): It's more of an ad-hoc hack  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 13:56): About JS frameworks, we're using Prototype. I think that it's the more serious of them (Prototype is to \u00a0JQuery like Java is to Visual Basic, IMO)  \ntudor\\_f - (02/04/2009 14:00): prototype will do fine (though i do manifest a preference towards jquery to be honest) :)  \nvlad\\_x - (02/04/2009 14:15): hello. Could someone tell me how the current CAPTCHA works on Xwiki?   \nvlad\\_x - (02/04/2009 14:17): I mean ... does it \u009d pop - up \u009d each time someone connects and that's that or does it work on idle users as well ?  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 14:18): I don't know, I've never seen it in action  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:18): vlad\\_x: I remember seeing mails explaining how to do it in the mailing list archives, you can search on markmail.xwiki.org  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:19): but as sergiu said I don't know if it works at all, a little or not at all  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:19): it used to work that's all I know  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:19): but that was a long time ago  \nvlad\\_x - (02/04/2009 14:19): ok. I'll check it out :) . Thank you both.  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:20): note that jerome velociter is planning to work on it during the XE 1.9 timeframe  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:20): (jvelociter)  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:20): actually it's xwiki.markmail.org  \nvlad\\_x - (02/04/2009 14:21): ok.  \njvelociter - (02/04/2009 14:21): yes it's possible to make it work, it means overriding register.vm in XWiki.Registration to add a couple of lines. As vmassol said, this is explained in mail thread archives on users or devs lists  \nvlad\\_x - (02/04/2009 14:22): jvelociter : thanx for the info.   \nvlad\\_x - (02/04/2009 14:25): also ... I have another question. I read that GsoC students will be given some \" bugs \" to fix. Does this mean all candidates or just the ones that have been selected for the projects?  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 14:27): Normally, just those accepted  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 14:28): But given that this year we have strong competition, we might ask some of the candidates to provide a patch, so that we can see who is a faster learner  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 14:29): Note that other organizations have a patch requirement in the application phase  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:29): vlad\\_x: btw it's not about \"bugs\" but \"issues  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:29): \"  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 14:29): \"No patch, no chance\"  \nsdumitriu - (02/04/2009 14:29): We're kind enough not to have this strong requirement  \nvlad\\_x - (02/04/2009 14:30): could you give us an example ? Somethings like a short sneak peak :) ?   \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:30): \"SoC students have time allocated to familiarize with XWiki development process. As such we'd like each SoC student to pick one or several existing issues in JIRA and send a patch that fixes it/them before that period ends (from April 20th to May 23rd) \"  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:30): from: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/  \nvmassol - (02/04/2009 14:31): gsocers are the one to pick the issue they're interested to work on  \ncypromis - (02/04/2009 14:31): ok  \ncypromis - (02/04/2009 14:31): what part of openoffie do I need to use the office plugin ?and what part of graphviz  \ncypromis - (02/04/2009 14:31): trying to do a ncie new install but getting confused by those parts of the settings  \nglerouge - (02/04/2009 14:31): for OpenOffice, a standard OOo 3 instance should be ok  \nglerouge - (02/04/2009 14:32): then go to your wiki's admistration and look at the OpenOffice server administration icon  \nglerouge - (02/04/2009 14:32): you can start it from there  \ncypromis - (02/04/2009 14:33): so no need to do the setup in xwiki.cfg/properties ?  \nxwikibot - (02/04/2009 14:43): Design.WebHome was modified by xwiki:XWiki.GuillaumeLerouge - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/  \nxwikibot - (02/04/2009 14:44): Design.WebHome was modified by xwiki:XWiki.GuillaumeLerouge - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/  \nvlad\\_x - (02/04/2009 14:47): sorry for bothering you again, but does xwiki currently have a recovery mechanism ?
