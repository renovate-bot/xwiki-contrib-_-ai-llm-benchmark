Everybody seems to want to do this release :D  \n10:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I would prefer not to do it, since I have stuff to catch up to  \n10:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ok - I'm done \u2026. there are many other isssues - but this one was a blocker - thanks for waiting - you can go on with the release. My commit will not affect the tests.  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then I'll start in 30 minutes  \n10:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so whoever wants to do it, I`m fine with it  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: yes 6.2.2 is ok  \n10:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n10:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: any idea how I could cast to a float in velocity?

 \n10:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0a string  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$numbertool.toNumber()  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0returns a Number  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then floatValue()  \n10:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yep, nice one  \n10:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0forgot about that  \n10:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0though not velocity friendly at all  \n10:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thx  \n10:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m pusing a fix for 6.2.1 as well in 5 minutes  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe there's a simpler way I don't now  \n10:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0none that I could found  \n10:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*find  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: here's another possibility  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$mathtool.toDouble(\u2026).floatValue()  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very similar....  \n10:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I know, but indeed, same logic  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: you need a float for what ?  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0passing it as method parameter ?  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0filtering in the livetable  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0query parameter  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so can't use automatic conversion indeed  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0nope  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the solution worked out nicely  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\u00a0#set($numberValue = $numbertool.toNumber(${filterValue}))  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\u00a0#if($tableName == 'IntegerProperty' || $tableName == 'LongProperty') ...etc  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\u00a0#set($numberValue = $numberValue.longValue())  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0#set($numberValue = $numberValue.intValue())  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\u00a0#set($numberValue = $numberValue.floatValue())  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0#set($numberValue = $numberValue.doubleValue())  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I re-did the filtering fix so that it is complete  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the issue was only about long, but the problem was with all numbers  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0XWIKI-11000  \n10:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0committing  \n11:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0should be fine now  \n11:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m done for 6.2.1  \n11:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: how can I launch a functional test from maven with my own instance of xwiki ?  \n11:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't want the test to stop mine and to start a new instance  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: as far as I can see in XWikiExecutor you can set -DxwikiPort and -DxwikiStopPort  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you need to use:  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0-Dxwiki.test.verifyRunningXWikiAtStart=true  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since 6.2)  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the pom sets it to false by default  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha no reuse the existing instance, read too fast  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you need to override it on the command eline  \n11:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok good  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0startig the 6.2.1 release  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm this mean that when starting a test from the EDI it will try to start a new instance by default ?  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no the opposite :)  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the default is true  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so we force Maven \u00a0by default to not reuse it, ok  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10745 is still open  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that normal?  \n11:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes I wanted to postpone it to 6.2.2  \n11:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's done now  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I need to verify that I do not break the tests before commiting it  \n11:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0let say we'll do it for 6.2.2  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I saw some commits yesterday  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was another issue?  \n11:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0not about that for sure  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0about the languages at the top right in the top menu  \n11:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I did commit but on my own fork, as a backup  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I saw teh screenshots  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but probably not the commits  \n11:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0about -Dxwiki.test.verifyRunningXWikiAtStart=true, it's the same for selenium-1 based tests?  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: yes, it's in XWikiExecutor  \n11:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:01\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n12:17\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:20\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0building platform 6.2.1 now....  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys we need to decide how we handle RN for 6.3M1. Right now it says \"Since 6.2\". I think we should keep that  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this means that all RN in 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 need to be also copied in 6.3M1 RN  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've done that for 6.2.1  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but everyone will need to do that for 6.2.2 too  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we agree about this strategy  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other strategy is to remove stuff from 6.3 but I find that less good  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and say \"Since 6.2.1\" and then \"Since 6.2.2\" in the RN of 6.3M1  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this will remove a lot for 6.3M1 RN so I don't like it too much  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW in the RN for 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 we don't need detailed RN, the full list of jiras should be enough  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's what we do in general for bug fix releases)  \n13:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a06.2.1 is not only a bug fix release...  \n13:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes that's the main issue, usually we don't really have to wonder about what RN should contain the new features and improvements  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think it changes anything  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's still majoritarily a stabilization/bugfix release of 6.2  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(mostly stabilizing the flmaingo skin)  \n13:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0then 6.3 is a stabilization of 6.2 too, regarding flamingo  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau\\_: not just flamingo, thre are most stuff for 6.3  \n14:06\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok release done in maven  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lots of jobs are going to fail  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because ci needs a rebuild of the 6.2.x branch in the right order....  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0always a pain  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as usual yes  \n15:00\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:04\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:28\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:39\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm at this step: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleasePlans/ReleasePlanHelp#HPushtoOW2  \n15:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at http://forge.ow2.org/project/showfiles.php?group\\_id=170&release\\_id=5539 I see that the standard jar has been uploaded  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but only this one it seems  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that something you got too when you did your last release?
