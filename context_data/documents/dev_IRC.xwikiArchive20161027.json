There was a problem for the first or second version of this XAR though  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like 1.0 or 1.1  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but 1.2 was ok AFAIR  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's upgrading from 1.1 here  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not 1.2  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok and this is something you fixed already I think in the code base right?  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like you did not installed 1.2  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I think I remember that you fixed something on this)  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'll import it for now  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't remember  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you sure it was not really something wrong in the XML ?  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no I mean preventing instaling a new vesion when an old version has a problem  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you fixed that issue  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the delete maybe  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but for an upgrade you have to load the previous  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/delete/uninstall/  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I'll need to be careful, I need to manually merge stuff :)  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/Data/XWiki/8.4RC1/ looks better now  \n17:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0great :)  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mean: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/Data/XWiki/8.4RC1/#HXWikiSelectWidgetcanbefiltered  \n17:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0btw, in the release notes of 8.4, could be reuse the changes from 8.4-rc-1 but with a black list?  \n17:13\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0for example, if we remove from 8.4 something we have done in 8.4rc1  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no we can't right now  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a jira issue for this already  \n17:13\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok so you know it  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what can be done is remove it from 8.4RC1  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it wasn't a good thing  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's better to not advertise it anyway even in 8.4RC1 :)  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's what I did for some issue I worked on in 8.3 AFAIR)  \n17:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but sometimes it is just because we have improve it, and it make no sense to display the 2 changes in 8.4  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it's not like we were removing the jira issue, thoese RN are about main points  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I introduced something and remove it because it was a bad idea)  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but indeed there is the case where it's a bit difference  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like it was partial in RC1  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/RN-18  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what might be nice is to have ids and if you use the same id in 8.4 it replace the one from 8.4RC1  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that you can simply rewrite it the way you want  \n17:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0for example in http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/Data/XWiki/8.3/, we have 2 separated sections for the Not Found Screen  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that could an idea, haven't started thinking about how to implement this issue  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@gdelhumeau sure but I'm not sure if it's that important  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even with a blacklist or somrthing, it would still not be working fine  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it could, depends  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for final it would but not for M1, M2, final  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway, it's possible, but I haven't thought about it yet :)  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also need to think about the changes report  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not the RN)  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm found another bug\u2026  \n17:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Enygma`: would you like to check my last commit? https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/45959c669b82321ca97ec338d7965a9c5428c88f  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@thomas I had installed 1.2 of the RN app actually  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but since the problem was in v1.1, I also had to import it  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=XWiki.ExtensionUpdater#extension-body-progress--695545785 it still says 1.1  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and now it says 1.1 too  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that normal BTW? shouldn't the import be considered as an install?  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when nothing is there  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah hmmm  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but registereing the id of the imported XAR all the time was creating too many issue with people importing just one page from some standard page for any reason  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0something we could improve in the future no?  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's on pupose  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0purpose  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is there something (jira?) I can read about this to understad the problem?  \n17:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not urgent though)  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just curious)  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so for xwiki.org how do we fix it so that next time I can upgrade the extension?  \n17:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10618  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thx  \n17:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the quickest is to remove it from the extension index on filesystem  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I could remove the extension from the perm dir and reinstall  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0next time we do a restart...  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0remove it now  \n17:29\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(otherwise next time you will forget :))  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I need to be prepared to install it  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't care  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the pages will still be there  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it just won't be marqued as installe  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll just have all pges in conflict I guess  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0marked  \n17:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0only if there is changes  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when I install v1.3)  \n18:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:47\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:27\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:39\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n21:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:54\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:46\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n23:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit\n"}
