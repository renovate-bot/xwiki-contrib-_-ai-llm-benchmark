 \n10:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0not really  \n10:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but at least +1 to dig in this direction  \n10:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I'm getting tired of the load JSX adds to the page  \n10:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0for the standard page there's like 10+ scripts already  \n10:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0modularized javascript seems like the only real way to expand in js  \n10:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It does have an optimization script which we could include in our build, it runs in rhino and it can compile and \"link\" javascript  \n10:17\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0you can actually feel the weight when doing CTRL refresh, it's frustrating  \n10:17\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0ok  \n10:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0indeed  \n10:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0funny that I'm using C/C++ terminology for js  \n10:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0static linking  \n10:18\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0that would be interesting indeed, this + dynamic loading of on demand JSX  \n10:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0That's just optional, what's important is getting the script included so we can grow from there  \n10:18\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0yep  \n10:19\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but managing JSX with it would be a huge gain  \n10:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0require([\"prototype-1.7\"], function($) { .....stuff that uses prototype });  \n10:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's kind of a nice feature  \n10:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0although it's kind of a lie because prototype b0rks the DOM tree at a low level so you can't really prevent it from having some influence  \n10:19\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0not sure function($) brings anything in this case, I think prototype exports $ anyway  \n10:20\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0(where jquery doesn't)  \n10:20\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0yep  \n10:20\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0at some point we should maybe move away from prototype  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0+1 for moving away from prototype  \n10:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and one way to do that is to write new js using require(['jquery-1.8'], function($) { ... . });  \n10:22\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0yes  \n10:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: have you any thoughts on this?  \n10:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0modular dependency injection for javascript :)  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: sorry no thought, I don't know this domain well enough  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(would need to google and research it)  \n10:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0we'll have a lot of legacy components based on prototype, but I think if we want to move away from proto we have to start writing new code differently anyway  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I suggest you make a proposal and explain the consequences  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(sounds good in general)  \n10:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'll try to present my research in my proposal but I'm a strong +1 at the moment  \n10:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0not sure sdumitriu will be thrilled by moving to jqueryu  \n10:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I think it's important we at least discuss all those topics before starting the 5.x skin Caty proposed  \n10:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Whether he or you or I like jQuery or not is kind of beside the point, jQuery \"won the standards war\" so to speak.  \n10:25\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0and have a general direction of where we want to go with regards to the JS world  \n10:25\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I agree  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree cjd, now we need to see what this means for what we already have and how we would migrate/move away from it  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that should be part of your proposal  \n10:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok, I will add that  \n10:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's kind of out of the domain of require.js but I see that it makes sense.  \n10:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I want to hear something from sdumitriu before putting it on the list though..  \n10:26\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0there are a couple of domains prototype covers that we will likely need a replacement for  \n10:26\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0- custom events  \n10:26\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0- class system  \n10:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm jquery doesn't let you listen for custom events?  \n10:28\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I was thinking about firing  \n10:28\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but maybe it does, I'm not a jquery expert  \n10:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0$(\"#myelement\").trigger('fuelified');  \n10:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0$(\"#myelement\").bind('fuelified',function(e){ ... });  \n10:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-custom-events-they-will-rock-your-world/  \n10:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0from a quick googling  \n10:28\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0ok it seems to be possible http://jamiethompson.co.uk/web/2008/06/17/publish-subscribe-with-jquery/  \n10:29\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0there is one thing jQuery will bring that will be very valuable for us  \n10:29\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it's event delegation  \n10:29\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0we need that since we are pulling components asynchronously from many places with the JSX system  \n10:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0While we're talking, what are your thoughts on YUICompressor vs. ClosureCompiler?  \n10:30\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0and right now the best we could come up with is that components should listen to \"xwiki:dom:loaded\" AND \"xwiki:dom:updated\" to be able to handle \"future elements\"  \n10:30\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0cjd: none :)  \n10:31\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I only have used YUICompressor  \n10:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0From what I've seen, ClosureCompiler seems to be a real validating compiler with constant folding and error messages whereas YUI is more of a minifier  \n10:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0You do get errors from YUI of course but it looks like CC is more strict  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:35\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:52\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n11:58\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:15\u00a0<qwebirc66475>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:17\u00a0<qwebirc66475>\u00a0has quit  \n13:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n13:50\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:35\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n15:02\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grrr http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Rendering/job/xwiki-rendering/1099/console  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0removing parallel run  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok works  \n16:18\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:49\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:12\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0vmassol: tdelafoss I will rename the holiday request app on github, ok ?

Does that work for you?  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Not deferring require.js? Yes  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0That one's small, AFAIK  \n18:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's 1993 lines before minification  \n18:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0require([\"jquery-1.8\"], \u00a0\u00a0vs. \u00a0\u00a0require([\"jquery\"], \u00a0do you have an opinion?  \n18:42\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a01.8  \n18:42\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Or wait  \n18:42\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Do we fetch it from a CDN, or from our own server?  \n18:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I would say from our own server since some people might be firewalled...  \n18:43\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Then use just jquery.js  \n18:43\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n18:44\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh and should I add a #3 deprecate the usage of prototype.js in our own code in favor of jQuery ?  \n18:47\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Like we do with prototype.js  \n18:47\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0We can upgrade on the filesystem without requiring an update of all the client scripts  \n18:47\u00a0<mrvanes\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0heh thought you were lagging  \n18:49\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so WDYT re deprecating usage of prototype for ourselves? I am hesitent to push new paradigms on people but we probably ought to move in one direction or the other  \n18:49\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0No, just doing lots of stuff in parallel  \n18:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nps  \n18:50\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0I'm gonna have to investigate something  \n18:50\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0What's jQuery's take on classes and OOP?  \n18:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't know that much about it, I guess I'm kind of playing the \"no opinion\" role and saying \"everyone else uses it\"  \n18:57\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Switching office, ttyl  \n18:58\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:40\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tdelafoss: hi, you should use the image macro on e.x.o  \n19:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your images are also a bit large :)  \n19:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tdelafoss: there a guide actually for xwiki.org let me find it  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DocGuide  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for images, see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DocGuide#HScreenshots2FImages  \n19:44\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:47\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0cjd: Back  \n19:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sdumitriu: I just sent the proposal, I found a few class systems which we could easily adapt but I don't feel right about proposing a best practice without getting dirty and doing some porting first  \n19:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://digg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascript/Class/trunk/Class.js <-- this one looks promising  \n19:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Me too  \n19:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I was going to try and port some of our widgets first  \n19:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0to requirejs or to jQuery?  \n19:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0jq  \n19:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think either way, what I'm proposing now makes sense, we need modules and I took require.js out for a test drive and it's still here.  \n19:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0And ofc our users need jq even if we don't.  \n19:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0anyway the AMD way is to wrap everything in define() functions so using Class.js would be something like \u00a0\u00a0define(['Class'], function(Class) { Class.create(...); })  \n19:59\u00a0<tdelafoss>\u00a0vmassol: Thanks for the doc. It is better now (images are still not exactly the good size, but it looks better nonetheless :) ), I would finish it on Monday.
