I have installed ircbot without using the advanced search. this installed version 4.2. I removed version 4.2, but now when I use advanced search I have a upgrade button (don't know why since the previous version was removed) and pressing it I get http://pastebin.com/3mQ3JMtd  \n12:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0and I am notified that version 4.2 is still installed. this must be another bug for sure  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how did you remove version 4.2?  \n12:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0uninstall from \"Installed Extensions\"  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from the UI?  \n12:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then it's a bug IMO  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should raise it  \n12:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thing is that I'm on snapshot, I hope this doesn't make it harder to reproduce. reporting  \n12:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0reproduced also on 4.3-RC1. So it's not because of snapshots  \n12:22\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Are you guys open on contributions nowadays?  \n12:25\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Or open-minded?  \n12:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n12:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0what do you mean by that, crocket?  \n12:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: should I create a new Jira component for Solr Search ?  \n12:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right now I`ve added some issues directly to the Search Jira component, but that doesn`t feel quite right  \n12:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: check skype message :)  \n12:32\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, I mean http://lists.xwiki.org/pipermail/devs/2012-November/052794.html  \n12:32\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I think it can go into the core.  \n12:33\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Nobody has written a component that helps users sort XWiki Objects by their properties.  \n12:33\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I'm going to read about contribution in xwiki.org and try to push it to the core.  \n12:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0crocket: did you read http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Contributing ?  \n12:34\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I'll read about it this weekend.  \n12:34\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, I was reading it.  \n12:35\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: reported: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8476 hope it's clear enough  \n12:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0crocket: if you feel that something \\*should\\* (don`t read \\*needs to\\*) go into the core, then you can create a jira issue and attach a pull request. If it is not accepted into the core, then you can publish it as an extension which is easily installable with the Extension Manager.  \n12:36\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, Can you take a time to see my component? https://snowberry.me/xwiki/Sandbox/NetworkServices  \n12:36\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0It's demonstrated on https://snowberry.me/xwiki/Sandbox/NetworkServices  \n12:36\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0oops  \n12:36\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0There is an error  \n12:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I understand, but if I had the time, I would have answered your mail  \n12:38\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, Please visit again http://snowberry.me/xwiki/Sandbox/NetworkServices  \n12:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0crocket: making a pull request is the way to make people look over your code, using the proper tools.  \n12:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this way the right people get notified and, when they have the time, will review your code.  \n12:38\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, It compares the running times of XWQL and my component.  \n12:39\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0yeah  \n12:39\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, Is it that simple? just make a jira issue and attach a pull request on github?  \n12:39\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0crocket: today is a release day - I don't think anyone will have the time to review it today  \n12:40\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I don't know which package my sort component belongs to.  \n12:41\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0If it had to go in the core, I'd need to choose the right package and the right maven groupId and artifactId.  \n12:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nice services :)  \n12:42\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I think it'll be discussed once there are a jira issue and a pull request on github.  \n12:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Note that my opinion is nothing at all should be added to core unless it's actually making API which makes extensions easier to build..  \n12:43\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0cjd : hmm... ok  \n12:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0But we have a nice extension manager so things which were outright impossible just a year ago are really easy now  \n12:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm not belittling your project, we need more metrics, especially performance metrics. It's just that I think it belongs in an extension, perhaps as part of AdminTools  \n12:44\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0cjd : I don't have a lot of data for performance metrics.  \n12:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0your small measurement of query performance is better than what we have at the moment ;)  \n12:48\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0cjd : Does $services.query belong to the core?  \n12:49\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Or is it an extension?  \n12:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0IMO it should be an extension but it is currently in the core.  \n12:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Keep in mind that many of these things existed prior to the extension manager so at that time we had no choice  \n12:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0cjd: the query module is an extension, AFAIK: xwiki-platform-query-manager  \n12:51\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0cjd : Keeping lots of components out of the core means people will submit many extensions with overlapped functionalities.  \n12:51\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, It got installed via a wizard.  \n12:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0crocket: what do you mean?  \n12:52\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, xwiki-platform-query-manager.  \n12:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0what you get by default in XWiki is not necesarily in the core  \n12:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when you say core, you actually mean bundled by default  \n12:52\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, How did the wizard install this if it wasn't in the core?  \n12:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but when I say core, I mean xwiki-platform-oldcore  \n12:53\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0ok  \n12:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0which is pretty much deprecated  \n12:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we are moving to a completely extension-driver architecture  \n12:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0where every module is an extension  \n12:53\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, How can I make the wizard install my component?  \n12:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you would have to add it to the XWiki Enterprise UI extension  \n12:55\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, But my component is not a UI extension.  \n12:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right, in your case, you need to add it to the XWiki Enterprise Web extension  \n12:57\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, I skipped the wizard and installed UI extensions right away, then I couldn't see lots of stuff installed by the wizard.  \n13:02\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, Where on extensions.xwiki.org can I find XWiki Enterprise Web extension?  \n13:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it does not have an extension page. AFAIK, it comes from the maven repository and it coresponds to the xwiki-platform-web maven artifact that gets translated into an extension to be installed with ExtensionManager.  \n13:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0stuff from the xwiki repositories can have extension pages that are used as documentation, but it's not mandatory. The actual extensions come from the maven repository.  \n13:08\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, So I make a JIRA issue and a pull requst on github for submission to xwiki-platform-web?  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: seems there's a misconception about \"IMO it should be an extension but it is currently in the core.\"  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is in commons/rendering/platform/enterprise are not core things  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're just extensions  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is different about them from others is just that they are \\*\\*maintained\\*\\* by the xwiki dev team  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from a packaging POV, XE will become an almost empty shell with just the DM to let you install whatever you want in the not too far future  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0crocket: you should ask to have your code put in xwiki-contrib  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://contrib.xwiki.org  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I'm not sure about the need for a separate component. If we do then we'll need \u00a03 components: search ui, search lucene and search solr  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally the rule we have so far is  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one jira component per top level module in platform-core  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I agree that for large top level modules we might need to go one level deeper  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in this case I think we need to materialize all sub modules  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie the 3 I mentioned for search  \n13:26\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0ok  \n13:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like we did for syntaxes in rendering  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: seems your merges fixes are not enough to fix the issue  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jv restested it  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and found the same issue  \n13:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, so for now I`ve created \"Search - Solr\"  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I know and I just commited new fix  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0( vmassol )  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok cool  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0didn't see the commit yet  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah just now  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there one a bug in BaseCollection and another one in XWikiDocument  \n13:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we need a //TODO hunting day...  \n13:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:31\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0When will com.xpn.xwiki.api.Object move to an extension?
