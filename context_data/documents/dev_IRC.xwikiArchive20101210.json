I need to apply additional cleaning filters when an office document is imported. So there is a cleaner component which uses multiple filters (which are also components) but their hints are hard-coded. I'm not sure what's best to do: (1) \"overwrite\" somehow the cleaner component (2) modify the cleaner component to look for a \"custom\" hint filter. WDYT?  \nvmassol - (10:01): mflorea:AFAIR it's already supported in the code. But I need to check it  \nvmassol - (10:01): sdumitriu: what should I do for the cache macro?  \nmflorea - (10:02): vmassol: what's supported is to get the cleaner configuration and add filters but I can't do that because the cleaner is internal to the office importer module. I want to hook custom HTML filters.  \nvmassol - (10:03): mflorea: i don't understand  \nvmassol - (10:03): you're talking about modiuign the office importer no?  \nvmassol - (10:03): \\*modifying  \nmflorea - (10:04): well, ideally I should be able to add my filters without modifying the office import module. These filters are very specific, they have no value for the platform.  \nvmassol - (10:04): sdumitriu: I can wait for 3.0 I guess but we'll need some hacking to be able to use it for xwiki.org (need to overwrite the macro tx jar + add the new cache macro jar)  \nmflorea - (10:04): ideally I would just drop my jar in WEB-INF/lib and the office importer cleaner would use them  \nvmassol - (10:05): hmmm that said we don't really need it for xwiki.org, there's a workaround  \nvmassol - (10:05): which is to stop xwiki.org, edit the properties file and hardcode the page to be cache since we alreayd have a rendering cache at the page level  \nvmassol - (10:05): sdumitriu: ok I'll wait then  \nvmassol - (10:06): mflorea: then you'd need different roles  \nvmassol - (10:06): and you no longer have control over what filter to use  \nvmassol - (10:07): which is bad from a programatic POV  \nvmassol - (10:07): it's better to pass a list from an api pov  \nmflorea - (10:08): hmm, you can control what jars you have in your WEB-INF/lib  \nvmassol - (10:08): but the code that passes the list could auto dsicover for a given use case  \nvmassol - (10:08): mflorea: there are differnet levels  \nvmassol - (10:08): API level  \nvmassol - (10:08): instance level  \nvmassol - (10:08): at the api level there's no notion web-inf/lib at all  \nmflorea - (10:08): right  \nvmassol - (10:08): it's really hard for a dev  \nvmassol - (10:08): to have to create a custom classloader  \nvmassol - (10:09): overwrit ethe default CL with his own oe  \nvmassol - (10:09): one  \nvmassol - (10:09): to be able to control what gets passed  \nvmassol - (10:09): remmeber your discussion about this the other day  \nvmassol - (10:09): :)  \nvmassol - (10:09): but as I said  \nvmassol - (10:09): we can have 2 levels  \nvmassol - (10:09): at our API level we pass a list of filters  \nvmassol - (10:10): as it's done now  \nvmassol - (10:10): it's just the caller that can decide how he gets that list  \nmflorea - (10:13): ok. but in the office importer case, there is a custom HTML cleaner that uses the default HTML cleaner from xwiki-xml module. The custom office importer HTML cleaner gets the default cleaner configuration and adds his own filters. I was thinking about: (1) modify the office importer cleaner to add one more filter with hint \"custom\" (or what ever) in order to allow custom filtering or (2) overwrite somehow the office importer cleaner (MyCustomOfficeImportClea  \nmflorea - (10:14): s/the hint of the office importer filter/the hint of the office importer cleaner  \nvmassol - (10:16): what you could do I guess is have a new role for filters for the office importer  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 10:24  \nmflorea - (10:25): vmassol: but wdyt about component implementation overwriting? Let's say I have a component and an implementation with hint \"foo\". Later I want to \"redirect\" the \"foo\" hint to a new implementation. Is this advisable?  \nvmassol - (10:26): mflorea: yes but not for us  \nvmassol - (10:26): for users  \nvmassol - (10:26): this is the mechanism for users to change xwiki behaviors  \nvmassol - (10:27): (when we don't offer explicit extension points)  \nmflorea - (10:27): how would a user do that? For instance, how would a user replace the velocity macro, using the same hint.  \njvelo left at 10:27 (Client Quit  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:27  \nvmassol - (10:28): mflorea: here: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Component+Module#HOverrides  \nsabageru joined #xwiki at 10:28  \nmflorea - (10:30): vmassol: great!
