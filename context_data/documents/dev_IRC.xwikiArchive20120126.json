It used to have the include macro for the sheet, but that's not needed with the new sheet system. I had the same problem with App Within Minutes, see my comment to XWIKI-7268 . I changed XWikiDocument#mergeXObjects to not add the objects if they already are there, in order to minimize the problem (at least in my case). i.e the page is saved, but   \n08:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0The real issue is the test in readFromTemplate, that checks for empty content. It's there from the beginning, I think, but I don't understand why we need it.  \n08:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think it should test for isNew()  \n08:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n08:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:41\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: you forgot to apply our support best practice ;)  \n09:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: thanks for creating an extension (I should have done it)  \n09:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n09:01\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0your code doesn't work :P  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tried it  \n09:01\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I've tested it first  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0me too  \n09:01\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what doesn't work for you?

I'll dig more.  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: another issue:  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I had added a field  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I had named it \"STATUS\"  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when in class editr  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I've edited the class again  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and replaced the \"S\" by a \"T\"  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue is that when I edit the livetable columns  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it now says \"StatuT\"  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(uppercase T)  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the LT still displays \"Status\"  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and not \"Statut\")  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the LT it's probably because I need to save so that it regenerates it  \n15:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, you need to resave the livetable  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed if I save it's now \"StatuT\"  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there's the problem of uppercase/lowercase  \n15:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't think there is. Are you sure you pressed \"t\" and not \"T\"?  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure why we put it all in uppercase  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even if I did  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it displayed STAUT  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0STATUT  \n15:48\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why are we hiding what the user is typing?  \n15:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, because that is how the label looks like in inline edit mode  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since we don't normalize it  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and use what the user typed thereafter  \n15:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:49\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, will fix that as soon as I get the time  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's WYSIDNWYG\"  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0What you see is definitely not what you get  \n15:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it is what you get, if you edit an entry, it will look exactly the same  \n15:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the WYSIWYG refers to the sheet  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not using any wyswiyg editor here  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what yo'ure talking about  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm talking about livetable and LT column editor  \n15:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the class editor is a wysiwyg with respect to the sheet it generates  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case there's a problem  \n15:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the field label is introduced in class editor  \n15:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I agree it is a problem for the live table editor  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I type \"status\" I see \"STATUS\" and it displays \"status\"  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0displays in LT and LT column editor  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's a mistake to use uppercase conversion in the class editor for labels  \n15:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n16:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n16:36\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:39\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:47\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:50\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're going to need to spend some time debugging xwiki.org and find why it's slow  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's been consistently slow for some time now  \n17:36\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:46\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:58\u00a0<CIA-32>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r0e2202c\u000f \u000f/ (23 files in 2 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7455: Provide UI to import and synchronize an external extension in the repository - http://git.io/6-KcAA  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<CIA-32>\u00a0Eduard Moraru\u000f master\u000f \\* r21423de\u000f \u000f/ (4 files):\u000f Fixed page parent for some Workspaces pages. - http://git.io/giRzeg  \n18:27\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:57\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n19:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<jcater>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:29\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:30\u00a0<jcater>\u00a0hmm, I guess I should've read the admin guide on upgrading before I imported the new 3.4 default XAR as-is  \n19:36\u00a0<jcater>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:57\u00a0<cmarcoin>\u00a0has quit  \n20:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:38\u00a0<helge>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:41\u00a0<helge>\u00a0Hello, I have a problem with the history / rollback in XWiki pages.
