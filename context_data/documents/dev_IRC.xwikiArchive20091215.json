I'll send an email about it  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] second point: the skins  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:22): [Vincent Massol] we need to decide if we want to document only for the latest skin or take into account other supported skins  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:22): [Vincent Massol] right now supported skins are: colibri, toucan and albatross (not sure exactly though about albatross)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [silviar] I've only used colibri for the screenshots recently, but there are indeed screenshots of all the skins thoughout the documentation  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [Vincent Massol] again we need to decide here what we want to do  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [Vincent Massol] for ex on the watchlist app page  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [Vincent Massol] you said \"starting with XE 2.1...\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [Vincent Massol] which is not correct  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [Vincent Massol] it should be \"starting with XE 2.1 and the Colibri skin....\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [silviar] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:24): [Vincent Massol] but still  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:24): [Vincent Massol] we need to decide if we also document for Toucan/Alabtross  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:24): [Vincent Massol] I'll send some emails to ask for opinions on the list  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:24): [Vincent Massol] please participate to the thread! :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:25): [silviar] This means an increased ammount of time dedicated to documenting more or less the same thing. If the users decide they need this I could do this for all 3 skins. Otherwise I think the effort could be better used in creating other documents  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:25): [silviar] I will :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [silviar] If we make the doc for the latest version do you want me to keep only the documentation with the new action menus?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [silviar] or should I wait for a response from the users before i make any modification?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] no you can continue as you're doing now  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [silviar] ok  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 09:30  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Vincent Massol] mail sent  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 09:36  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 09:37  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Vincent Massol] lucaa: CTRL button doesn't work for me  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Vincent Massol] it shows the contextual menu  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [lucaa] yes, it seems to be the meta key on mac.

 \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [lucaa] no, it's a bug  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Vincent Massol] the highlight doesn't work for me  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Vincent Massol] I can't get my annotation highlighted  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [lucaa] because you're using a global user  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [Vincent Massol] ah  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [lucaa] you should use a local user so that you can set yourself an annotation color  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [lucaa] because the users class is only modified locally to have colors  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [Vincent Massol] I see  \nEnygma` left at 09:47 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)  \narkub joined #xwiki at 09:48  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:01): [lucaa] anyone knows what we use DummyUser on the incubator for?

 \nxwiki-bridge - (10:44): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: otp  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:44): [Vincent Massol] it's on dev.xwiki.org  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:44): [Vincent Massol] IRC.IRCBot from memory  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:46): [tmortagne] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:49): [anamarias] I see Template, Sheet and Classes have been put each in different spaces for this manager application http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-applications/trunk/application-manager/src/main/resources/ What was the reason for that, and what are the best practices in creating spaces for the documents of your application?  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:50): [anamarias] I was used to put all classes, sheets, templates, macros, etc in a space called SpacenameCode  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:50): [jvdrean] anamarias: it used to be a best practice a long time ago  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:50): [jvdrean] the current one is the one you saw, AppCode space  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:51): [anamarias] so what goes in which space, are there others or a documentation page?  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:52): [jvdrean] anamarias: the current one is the one you saw, one space for everything: AppCode space  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:53): [jvdrean] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:53): [anamarias] but this one also has XAppClasses, XAppManager, XAppResources, XAppSheets, etc  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:54): [anamarias] they're not all in XAppCode  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:55): [jvdrean] yes because the app is quite old and does not follow the latest conventions  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:56): [jvdrean] if it was written today it'd have only one space  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:56): [anamarias] ah, so the one at this location http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-applications/trunk/application-manager/src/main/resources/ is the old one!  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:56): [anamarias] not the other way around  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:57): [jvdrean] exactly  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:57): [anamarias] ok, thanks  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:00): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: done, hope i did not broke it ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:01): news  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:30): [Vincent Massol] guys we have 3 tests failing on hudson: http://hudson.xwiki.org/view/Functional%20Tests/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/275/testReport/  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:30): [Vincent Massol] apparently for teh same reason:  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:30): [Vincent Massol] ERROR: Element //div[@class='panel expanded QuickLinks'] not found  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:30): [Vincent Massol] jvdrean: any idea?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:31): [jvdrean] looking  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:31): [jvdrean] we have an additional $ \"panel $expanded QuickLinks\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:34): [sdumitriu] But that selector is not that good  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:34): [sdumitriu] Why don't you select just the QuickLinks?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:34): [sdumitriu] The panel won't always be expanded  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:35): [jvdrean] me ? :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:35): [Vincent Massol] we  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:35): [sdumitriu] Whoever wrote that  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:36): [jvdrean] we agree it's not a good selector, the $ shouldn't be there anyway  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:37): [jvdrean] have we allowed velocity sets to null ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:37): [Vincent Massol] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:37): [sdumitriu] Yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [jvdrean] ok, that's the reason  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [jvdrean] #set($expanded = \"expanded\")  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [jvdrean] #set($expanded = $xwiki.getUserPreferenceFromCookie($cookieName))  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [jvdrean] the second call overwrites the default value with null  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [Vincent Massol] oh I thought it was a non breaking change....  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:39): [Vincent Massol] so potentially it's causing bugs in several locations  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:39): [Vincent Massol] glurps  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:39): [Vincent Massol] sdumitriu: what's your plan? :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:40): [sdumitriu] Hunt them down and squash them? :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:40): [Vincent Massol] yes but it seems like it's an afterthought  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:41): [Vincent Massol] you mean: wait for someone to report the bug and fix them?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:41): [Vincent Massol] it's not very proactive  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:55): [Vincent Massol] is someone fixing the tests?

(14:56): [Vincent Massol] http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HConfiguringWikiSyntaxesanddefaultSyntax  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:56): [Vincent Massol] we could extract all

http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/URL+resolution is not dev guide, it's a general document entry point for URL management in XWiki with links to differents configurations  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:03): [Vincent Massol] ah yes got it  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:03): [Vincent Massol] hmmm not sure since it's not for admins  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:03): [Vincent Massol] might be better in DEvGuide  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:03): [tmortagne] it's \u00f9ainly used for admins  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:03): [tmortagne] to understand what they need to configure  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:03): [Vincent

\nxwiki-bridge - (15:04): [tmortagne] sure but devs need everythings admin stuff included  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:04): [Vincent Massol] actually  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:04): [Vincent Massol] it's

xwikibot already mentioned, a diagram of my approach for annotations renderers is now available at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Design/AnnotationFeature/annotationsRenderer.png . if you want / have time to look at it, I would also have some additional questions (besides an opinion on the approach)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:41): [Vincent Massol] ok checking  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:41):

\nxwiki-bridge - (15:43): [Vincent Massol] it's too detailed  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:44): [Vincent Massol] and btw that's why I hate class diagrams  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:44): [Vincent Massol] (they're not good for architecture description)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:44): [Vincent Massol] anca: all I see on the diagram is that there's an Annotation REnderer  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:44): [Vincent Massol] is there anything else to check?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:46): [Vincent Massol] do you have a diagram for the whole flow?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:46): [lucaa] we can talk if you want, I mean voice  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [lucaa] implied answer is no  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [Vincent Massol] (with the Rendered being one black box in that diagram)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [Vincent Massol]
