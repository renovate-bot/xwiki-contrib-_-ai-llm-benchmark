They could be moved to internal packages but that would also mean breaking the API  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's been broken anyway so if we want that it's the right time ;)  \n10:40\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I don't want to spend time on it :)  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I don't know if we want it though, I don't know enough)  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well right now you've broken a large number of apis, it's not really nice either...  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and doesn't look good int he RN  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're priding ourselves that we don't break backward compat so we need to try it to the max ;)  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway....  \n10:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a010:40 <@vmassol> and doesn't look good int he RN \u00a0<-- int he; \u00a0\u00a0I do that too  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n10:43\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0large in number, but if you look at the list you'll see that what it contains is:  \n10:43\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0\\* refactoring of the XWikiExplorer to use the new tree  \n10:43\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0\\* small changes in the 2 steps that were using the tree (and their base class)  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it's not important now because we have nobody extending the WYSIWYG? Still it would be nice to think about how to improve that in the future (either by moving them to internal or something else)  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0future is probably without this WYSIWYG ;)  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good point tmortagne  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea1 should be able to tell us aobut that real soon now :)  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(hopefully)  \n10:48\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I'm on it.
