So you forbid a to call a space \"A\", if a document \"A\" already exists?  \n16:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Maybe we're talking about the same thing with just a slightly different UI  \n16:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup  \n16:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0+a user  \n16:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0docs and spaces in the same collision domain  \n16:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but we already know some people who want to create child pages at any moment  \n16:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah... there's always a counter-usecase  \n16:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and I think that rename C to C.WebHome in order to let C having childs is a bit annoying  \n16:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but then in windows, nobody asks to convert a file into a folder, it's just accepted that they're different things  \n16:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0like it's created a reality in people's minds  \n16:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I agree it could be easier to see our hierarchy like the filesystem, but it's also importing some limitations that we should not have in a wiki  \n16:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0What are they? Other than convert a page to a space..  \n16:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I ask because the POSIX guys might have had the same problem and addressed it before (for example using fattr which nobody knows about)  \n16:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you still have the \"WebHome\" issue  \n16:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0WebHome means nothing  \n16:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm  \n16:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0You mean when you create a new \"folder\" you end up with something that has no \"index\" ?  \n16:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0At least it should be called \"Home\" and be translatable  \n17:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the idea was also to replace the current parent/child relationship  \n17:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup  \n17:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0where any document could have children  \n17:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0which can be anywhere right now  \n17:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0perhaps then \"Folder\" should just be a UI term for a document ?  \n17:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the parent document  \n17:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0that is confusing when you have complex hierarchy on the other hand  \n17:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but styalized as a folder so that people are comfortable coming from their file manager  \n17:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0feel free to ignore me in the end, I'm just spouting nonsense :)  \n17:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0your remark is pertinent cjd  \n17:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the one about nonsense?
