The issue is that we now always have a xdialog-screen hidden from the search suggest. There are two options: (1) Add the search suggest panel to the DOM only when you display search suggestions, or (2) write a more specific xpath in the ui-tests. I'm fine with (2) but if (1) is not very complicated then may  \n15:31\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mflorea: (1) should not be too hard eitehr  \n15:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0great, I'll let you fix it if you find the time, otherwise I'll update the xpath in the ui-tests before the release  \n15:36\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0ok great  \n15:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:56\u00a0<npm\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:00\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n21:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:34\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:35\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:52\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0has quit  \n22:53\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:27\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:38\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
