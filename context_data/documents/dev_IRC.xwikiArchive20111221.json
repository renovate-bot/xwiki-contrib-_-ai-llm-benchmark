It seems that the data model had not been migrated in this new version. Since this problem will only be available on the next correction release, you offered some help to assist me solving this error on my instance  \n17:41\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0the bug is the very same as http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XE-1037  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0Last week we could not proceed on this, due to the 3.3 release. If you could give me some help solving this before the next minor release, I would really appreciate.  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ramongb: hi  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Actually I've tested postgresql in the meantime  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0version 9.1  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I've found it to work quite well (I was surprised :))  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0We have 2 functional tests failing though that I haven't analyzed yet  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't tested the upgrade path though  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but starting clean with a 3.3 on postgresql 9.1 worked fine for me  \n17:52\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0starting clean should really work without problems, I believe. But the case is migrating from 3.1 to 3.3. I'm using Jboss 4.2.3 and Postgres 8.3. Since I have a long term production environment since xe 3.0, with tons of pages and data, starting clean is not the case, unfortunately. When starting the instance, it triggers an exception \"org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Bad value for type long : <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?  \n17:52\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0precisely on com.xpn.xwiki.doc.rcs.XWikiRCSNodeContent  \n17:53\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0any xe version starting on 3.2 fails on migration with postgresql  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ramongb: I don't have a solution out of the box. The way I solve these kinds of things is by googling usually and then adjusting the xwiki.hbm.xml file accordingly  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll try to spend some time on it in the future but I'm on holidays next week so I won't be help to do much till next year (10 days from now)  \n18:00\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0Sorry if I bother you with this too much, and of course I'll get some holidays too :) I would like to help as much as I can, I can't just figure out where I can start looking at the xwiki.hbm.xml  \n18:03\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0But absolutely no problem, vmassol. Thanks in advance all the help, I'll do some research as well, and maybe we can take a look on this after holidays.  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ramongb: you need to verify the type generated by hibernate in postgresql  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then check why it's a problem  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then try to adjust the xwiki.hbm.xml file  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can find this file in the \\*oldcore\\* jar in your WEB-INF/lib  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can extract it and put it in WEB-INF/classes and modify it  \n18:06\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0nice, i was in the right path, I've done that. I'll check the types  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:08\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0thanks again for the help, wish you good holidays  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks. I'm still connected for a few hours here if you have questions  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ramongb: what you could do is check the differences  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0between xwiki.hbm.xml in version 3.1 and in 3.3  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hibernate performs a schema update and maybe there's something it doesn't support with postgre  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0latest version is here: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/resources/xwiki.hbm.xml  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0history: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commits/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/resources/xwiki.hbm.xml  \n18:21\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0vmassol: nice, I'll check this in detail  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XE 3.1 was released 21 June 2011  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can see in the history what was modified  \n18:22\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0upgrades done from xe 2.7 to 3.1 were successfull, in my various instances, as far as I remember  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only change I can see is  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<property\u00a0name=\"language\"\u00a0column=\"XDD\\_LANGUAGE\"\u00a0type=\"string\"\u00a0length=\"5\"\u00a0/>  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<property\u00a0name=\"date\"\u00a0type=\"timestamp\"\u00a0column=\"XDD\\_DATE\"\u00a0/>  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<property\u00a0name=\"language\"\u00a0column=\"XDD\\_LANGUAGE\"\u00a0type=\"string\"\u00a0length=\"5\"\u00a0index=\"XDD\\_LANGUAGE\"\u00a0/>  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<property\u00a0name=\"date\"\u00a0type=\"timestamp\"\u00a0column=\"XDD\\_DATE\"\u00a0index=\"XDD\\_DATE\"\u00a0/>  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie the index addition  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0google gives a lot of info  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2069541/postgresql-jdbc-and-streaming-blobs  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is interesting too: http://www.artin.org/geekblog/2011/01/hibernate-3-6-0-final-postgresql-clobs/  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahah  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Ultimately I found a simple solution. \u00a0PostgreSQL apparently doesn\u2019t play well with Hibernate 3.6 and requires a specific Hibernate annotation on your entity (I\u2019m using JPA entities by the way). \u00a0On your CLOB, in addition to the @Lob, add:\"  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@Type(type=\"org.hibernate.type.StringClobType\")  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know how to do this  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so here's what you can try ramongb:  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0edit the xwiki.hbm.xml file and add the following before the first <class name  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<typedef name=\"materialized\\_clob\" class=\"org.hibernate.type.StringClobType\" />  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that should fix the issue I believe  \n18:31\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0hhhmmmm  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me know how it goes  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have the same \"trick\" for Oracle  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you can check xwiki.oracle.hbm.xml if you wish)  \n18:32\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0nice, I'll do it and I'll let you know  \n18:32\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0yep, I've followed the discussions about oracle  \n18:33\u00a0<ramongb>\u00a0it's just a thought, but I believe the problem is with the docId property from table xwikircs, from class XWikiRCSNodeContent  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think so  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it's with the content property of that table  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since this is what is in the stack trace :)  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XE-1037  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the xml goes in the content part  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not in the doc id  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the fact that the docid type is \"long\" is coincidental IMO  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2069541/postgresql-jdbc-and-streaming-blobs explains the long issue AFAIU  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Large binary objects are stored indirecty with OID columns in Postgres.\"  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"The actual file data is stored somewhere outside the database table by Postgres.
