if you input for example /path/to/some/resource.jpg, it will get rewritten as it thinks it is attachment name... also it's not possible to pass any other attributes there and it only affects img tag, not a href for example  \n13:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: you mean when you use xwiki/2.x syntax ?  \n13:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in xwiki/2.1 syntax you can prefix the target with \"path:\" and it will ends up exactly has you wrote it in the <img> tag  \n13:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: nope, when using html/4.01 syntax  \n13:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0i will try the path  \n13:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are using html as source ?  \n13:48\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, path: is working, thanks  \n13:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0when you need to migrate thousands of pages to xwiki and they are already in html, it's easier to just use html as source (and if there is need to modify it, switching syntaxes will do the conversion) and populate wiki via REST api  \n13:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now if it's plain html without any special comment the behavior you have looks like a bug to me  \n13:53\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, that's possible, i'm going to test it on latest version (i'm using 7.1.2)  \n13:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: if you can still reproduce would be nice if you could create a jira issue with steps to reproduce  \n13:54\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, testing it on 7.2  \n13:59\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: reproducible on 7.2, i will file a bug... thanks for the file: pointer  \n14:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:16\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0hmm.. the XAR format is nicely compressed :)  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a zip :)  \n14:17\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I guessed as much after zipping it and it saved me a couple hundred K on a 32MB xar :)  \n14:20\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:20\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm trying to get the language of a document when I'm on the \"this page is locked for editing\" template, I see <html lang=\"xxx\" but I'm worried this is specific to the user interface language and might not always reflect the language of the page you're trying to edit  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: right now there is only one current language, UI and content are not yet separated  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6402 indeed  \n14:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok, when I pass ?language=xxx in the URL, I can still view a page even if it only has english version  \n14:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0in this case, I see in the source \u00a0\u00a0<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\"  \n14:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and XWiki.docvariant = \"language=en\";  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the actual language of the default version of a document is \"\"  \n14:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but that's specific to view mode, it seems in edit mode, it always tries to edit a translation and does not care much whether such a thing exists  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you know it's english but from database point of view it's just the default language  \n14:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mhm  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and if whatever language you indicate does not exist then it fallback on parent language  \n14:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n14:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0So i suppose my question is whether <html lang=\"xxxx\" \u00a0should be considered a reliable indicator of document language while editing  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for edit yes it assume that if it does not exist you want to create it  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are in javascript ?  \n14:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yes  \n14:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If it was velocity, I'd grab tdoc.language :)  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm probably not the best bet for best practice on this, mflorea ?  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is probably some API  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or gdelhumeau ?  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0meta.js doesn't seem to provide this unfortunately  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we should probably add the doc language as a meta  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and keep the lang attribute as the interface language)  \n14:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Perhaps we should open an issue to add a field like XWiki.docLang so that we have something we can rely on even in the future after the UI and document may nolonger be the same language  \n14:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0?  \n14:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case yes we should probably have some data-xwiki-document-locale to be consistent if with other document related infirmation  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: do we have a jira issue for having the Add Link feature of WYSIWYG work in multiwiki mode?  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(right now the tree only shows pages from the local wiki and same for search)  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(so users can't make links to pages in other subwikis easily)  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: found it  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9227  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too bad we didn't do it yet, seems important and should be easy to implement IMO  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WDYT?  \n15:08\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n15:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12685  \n15:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0took a bit of time  \n15:14\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:01\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n16:17\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: what's the rule for hiding docextra?  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example I see that Blog.WebHome has it but I think you removed it from some extensions  \n16:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: he hide them on applications where the main purpose of the app is creating entities, not commenting for example  \n16:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0on Blog\u2026 comment is a common action IMO  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but Blog fits on that def  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why?  \n16:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0actually you are talking about Blog.WebHome...  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n16:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0that lists the posts  \n16:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k - I think it fits  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0scheduler too  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0stats app too  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0etc  \n16:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k - I can talk with Gabi - wdty?  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then next question: should we also hide the edit button (and possibly other menu action) too?  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for non admins)  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it depends  \n16:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0we didn't do this for other apps \u2026 since edit is a standard wiki feature. This would be another topic of discussion.  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have we agreed on this behavior btw (the hiding of docextra for apps)? (just curious)  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we have we should add it to the Best Practices guide then  \n16:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0there was nothing written, but mostly applied on contrib apps  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I think we should start a proposal for this. you want to lead it?  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: just created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/WIKIEDITOR-27 FYI  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(reported to me by Anca and I've reproduced)  \n16:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: did you try CTRL+G ? (Find next)  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that opens jump to page :)  \n16:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0https://codemirror.net/demo/search.html  \n16:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0AFAIK it was working  \n16:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0need to check  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fails on mac for sure since ctrl+g opens jump to page  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but even if it worked there's no UI help  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the browser's find doesn't work  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(only finds the first occurence)  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commented on the issue  \n16:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it's expected for the browser find to not work  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it's bad  \n16:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0seems that both GoTo and FindNext get triggered  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it half works  \n16:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0AFAIK, in the past, GoTo would not trigger  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it works for the first ocurence  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so whatever the technical reason from a user POV it's really bad  \n16:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0no, you can`t override/intercept the browser find  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no = ?  \n16:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I mean, you do that focused in the editor  \n16:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and there is the custom search  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW alt+F doesn't seem tow ork  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: no  \n16:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, notice that t  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm on a page I hit ctrl+F  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the browser search opens  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I type my word and hit enter  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it works  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the I hit enter again and it doesn't find the rest  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's a failure from a user POV  \n16:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0AFAIK, the whole content is not loaded in the editor's model for performance issues  \n16:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so you need to use the provided search API  \n16:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the browser search will find that is currently loaded/displayed  \n16:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but not more, since it's not loaded  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do we explain that to users?  \n16:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0will have to see if they did something to improve/control that  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what does it mean to load only partially the content?  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's in the DOM already  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in full)  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh for the syntax hilighting part  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that only the visible part is syntax hilighted  \n16:47\u00a0<Ramona>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we could disable this but you incur the cost of syntax-hilighiting the whole content  \n16:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when the editor loads, it does not load the entire content into the DOM  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case we need to fix at least the ctrl+G thing since for Anca it's a no go to use that extension without search working  \n16:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0only what is scrolled into view  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and I agree with her)  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the content is taken from where?
