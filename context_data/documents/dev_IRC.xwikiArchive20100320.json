In toucan, they cause the text below to shift.  \nvmassol - (10:06): good morning caleb  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:07): Good morning, I've been playing with a FF addon called perspectives which bypasses CA signatures if the site's key has been the same (stored on some mit servers.) neat stuff.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:08): I'll have to tell bblfish. I think this could be integrated into foafssl.  \nxenon75 joined #xwiki at 10:11  \nxenon751 joined #xwiki at 10:11  \nxenon75 left at 10:11 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nxenon75 joined #xwiki at 10:13  \nxenon751 left at 10:13 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nDV left at 10:16 (Ping timeout: 256 seconds  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:17  \ntmortagne left at 10:17 (Client Quit  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 10:20  \nheadache joined #xwiki at 10:23  \nheadache - (10:23): hello  \nxenon75 left at 10:30 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:35): Hi headache, is it just me or is everyone getting a big aggravating panel on the left side of the google search today?  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 10:36  \nheadache - (10:37): CalebJamesDeLisl, I've noticed no change  \nheadache - (10:37): however could be some new feature  \nheadache - (10:37): maybe something semantic  \nheadache - (10:37): :D  \nheadache - (10:37): maybe...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:38): Meh, I've already got a greasemonkey script to deal with it.  \nheadache - (10:40): :D  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:59  \ntmortagne - (11:02): sdumitriu: hi, would you have any idea why the jsx at http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/L10N/Flags?editor=object is not loaded ? it used to work well, core version did not changed, only thing i can see is maybe a restart  \ntmortagne - (11:02): would that be that in this version there is a bug that makes jsx not loaded when restarting xwiki ?  \ntmortagne - (11:02): (2.0.4 it seems)  \ntmortagne - (11:03): i did not tryinf to resave it yet  \ntmortagne - (11:03): it wanted to know what was the issue (i don't plan to resave it each time the wiki is restarted)  \ntmortagne - (11:04): s/was/is/  \ntmortagne - (11:05): btw i'm only talking about jsx set as \"Always\" loaded  \nsdumitriu - (11:06): Do you mean ssx?  \ntmortagne - (11:06): i mean XWiki.StyleSheetExtension  \ntmortagne - (11:06): so yes ssx sorry  \ntmortagne - (11:07): but i guess that's the same behavior  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:07): Hmm http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/ssx/L10N/Flags loads fine.  \ntmortagne - (11:08): sure but that's not the issue  \ntmortagne - (11:08): it's not listed in the <head>  \ntmortagne - (11:09): it's not automatically loaded  \nsdumitriu - (11:10): I've seen this problem on the incubator, too  \nvmassol - (11:11): the strange thing is that the l10n wiki hasn't been upgraded  \ntmortagne - (11:11): yes but ot's possible it has been restarted  \ntmortagne - (11:11): sdumitriu: how the list of extension \"Always\" is loaded ? for each page ? or is it when you save the extension ?  \nsdumitriu - (11:12): Yes, when you save the extension  \ntmortagne - (11:12): so maybe the issue is that it's not reloaded at startup  \ntmortagne - (11:12): in this version at least  \ntmortagne - (11:13): maybe it is now  \ntmortagne - (11:13): do you remember something like that ?  \nsdumitriu - (11:14): I have an idea, I'll check it in a few minutes  \nsdumitriu - (11:14): (now eating...)  \ntmortagne - (11:15): hmm CssSkinExtensionPlugin doe snot seems to do anything at startup  \ntmortagne - (11:15): ha it's in AbstractDocumentSkinExtensionPlugin probably  \ntmortagne - (11:16): same thing it just register events  \nDV joined #xwiki at 11:16  \ntmortagne - (11:17): if that's the issue, it's weird we did not seen that before since it makes this kind of extension unusable  \nsdumitriu - (11:23): tmortagne: Please check exactly what version of the xwiki-skinx plugin is used on that wiki  \ntmortagne - (11:24): it's a standard 2.0.4 AFAIK  \ntmortagne - (11:24): but as i just looked at trunk skinx and it doe snot seems to load extension at startup either  \ntmortagne - (11:26): going to eat, back in 30 min  \nDV left at 11:26 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nDV joined #xwiki at 11:26  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:32): $xwiki.getDocument(\"L10N.Flags\").getContentAuthor() \u00a0\u00a0== \u00a0\u00a0XWiki.AndreasJonsson  \nsdumitriu - (11:33): Ah, wait  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:33): / Only add the extension as being \"always used\" if the page holding it has been saved with programming rights.  \nsdumitriu - (11:33): AlwaysUsed extensions are used only when the author has admin rights  \nsdumitriu - (11:33): Or programming, right  \nmarta joined #xwiki at 11:33  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:34): Love that preview button.  \nsdumitriu - (11:36): Which one?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:36): In the edit window, open my profile, edit, write some code, preview.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:37): Wonder why the notification function isn't working, it should have stopped working on save.  \nheadache left at 11:49 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \ntmortagne - (11:50): sdumitriu: ok that make sense, so i should move this object in another document then  \ntmortagne - (12:07): sdumitriu, CalebJamesDeLisl: thanks for you help, all is working well now  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 12:07  \nheadache joined #xwiki at 12:08  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:08): bblfish: I found something you might be interested in: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~perspectives/firefox.html  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:09): Bypass the firefox self signed key cop, I am looking at the code and it looks like we can make it validate the website using foaf+ssl  \nbblfish - (12:11): that sounds good. But it won't be widely deployed enough to start off with. It is something to keep in mind though, along with the option of doing something more general with DNSsec  \nbblfish - (12:11): initially we are just going to have to pay those CAs  \nbblfish - (12:11): but it's something we should try to fix, I agree  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:13): I was thinking of it as another option so we can support 3 ways of connecting.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:14): 1. bounce off of foafssl.org or some other site, 2. get your site ca signed, 3. use foafssl to authenticate the user and the website :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:16): bblfish: The CA model is already quite broken, not sure if you saw my message earlier but read this: \u00a0https://blog.startcom.org/?p=145  \ntmortagne left at 12:17 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbblfish - (12:17): yes, I saw the talks by Dan Kaminsky at HAR http://is.gd/aPfo5 (view with FF).  \nbblfish - (12:17): and at Chaos Communication Congress  \nbblfish - (12:18): He was quite positive about foaf+ssl though  \nbblfish - (12:18): the problems dissapear with dnssec, as CA's are no longer needed  \nbblfish - (12:18): but we can get going with the system as it is  \nbblfish - (12:19): when it comes into place things will just be a lot easier  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:24): I admit I have to read more about dnssec. The problem I see now with dns is that the root servers can still MTIM you.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:24): (that's with the dns we have now)  \nbblfish - (12:24): DNS is about to fall over  \nbblfish - (12:24): that is why DNSsec is being implemented  \nbblfish - (12:25): the US government and the owners of .com are starting to deploy it  \nbblfish - (12:25): that was the message of all the talks at HAR on the subject  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:27): I know .se has dnssec implemented. I just downloaded the pdf...  \nDV left at 12:31 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:39): Reading the wiki: \"These starting points are known as trust anchors and are typically obtained with the operating system or via some other trusted source.\" \u00a0hmm looks like the CA model...  \nbblfish - (12:39): which wiki?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:41): wikipedia.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:42): \"Other countries are concerned about U.S. control over the Internet, and may reject any centralized keying\"  \nbblfish - (12:43): ah ok  \nbblfish - (12:43): yes, that's the problem. But the other option is the internet breaks down  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:44): The internet breaks down? how?  \nbblfish - (12:44): without DNS no internet  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:44): You are suggesting that the DNS will just cease up.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:44): ?  \nbblfish - (12:44): watch Dan Kaminsky's talk  \nbblfish - (12:45): yes, you can hack a DNS server in 2 months  \nbblfish - (12:45): and it is getting easier all the time  \nbblfish - (12:45): so all financial transactions are at risk  \nmflorea left at 12:45 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbblfish - (12:46): I think you can imagine that when something this big is a problem, people find solutions  \nbblfish - (12:46): or policial problems are solved  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:46): Can you point me to the exact video, I see a lot.  \nbblfish - (12:46): Search Dan Kaminsky  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:47): Lots of videos, where was it taken?  \nbblfish - (12:47): It's all on the page  \nbblfish - (12:48): HAckers at Random, Holland  \nbblfish - (12:48): HAR  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:48): Is the point that dns can be spoofed because I know it can.  \nbblfish - (12:48): yes, very fast  \nbblfish - (12:48): pretty easily  \nbblfish - (12:49): and usually X509 comes to the rescue  \nbblfish - (12:49): but it can't  \nbblfish - (12:49): that's his point  \nbblfish - (12:49): that is why the CAs have to be built into the DNS  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:49): Ok now I'm interested, you're saying https can be spoofed?  \nbblfish - (12:50): watch the video  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:50): All right, be back when it's done.  \nbblfish - (12:50): The point is the problem is MASSIVE  \nbblfish - (12:51): and part of it is a problem of X509, because it was thought to be the solution  \nbblfish - (12:51): but that does NOT mean https won't continue to exist  \nbblfish - (12:51): or be the right solution - it's just that DNS has to change  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:53): I'm at har and still can't find the video, is it one of the videos at your blog?  \nbblfish - (12:54): yes, you have to watch it on Firefox  \nbblfish - (12:54): (I hope the videos are still available)  \nbblfish - (12:55): as they are ogg video format  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:55): Ok it looks like the second video down.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:58): Downloading the file, it's skipping bad.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:59): I heard the first minute or so and he points out the problem I pointed out, you have to trust a bunch of CAs you don't know.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:01): I can see why verisign would want to apply the CA model to the .com and .net zones (which they control) because they are a huge CA.  \nxenon75 joined #xwiki at 13:02  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:08): bblfish: Movie still downloading... Can you explain to me how this works? I go to website x but dns is spoofed, and I get website y. How does site y get it's web address signed so my browser accepts it?  \nbblfish - (13:10): when I watch it in FF it plays immediately  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:10): Yes it skipped badly though.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:11): Am I to understand that the jist of the problem is that I can get a signed key for a web address that isn't mine because the CA's don't know the DNS guys?  \nsdumitriu - (13:43): Hm, I thought that XWIKI-4637 was fixed already...  \nvmassol - (13:44): I thought it was too  \nvmassol - (13:44): have you checked fisheye?  \nvmassol - (13:44): IMO jerome forgot to close it (he forgets quite frequently to close issues ;))  \nsdumitriu - (13:45): I'll check if it was included in 2.2 also  \nvmassol - (13:45): yes it is  \nvmassol - (13:45): I changed the fix for  \nvmassol - (13:46): closing it  \nsdumitriu - (13:46): Yep  \nsdumitriu - (13:47): Components: templates and UI  \nvmassol - (13:47): ah can you change it?  \nsdumitriu - (13:47): Sure  \nvmassol - (13:47): (I put core without knowing)  \nbblfish - (13:54): CalebJamesDeLisl: Je viens de revoir le video. Il n'en parle que tout a la fin  \nbblfish - (13:54): Je pense que son dernier video au CCC etait mieux  \nsdumitriu - (13:55): bblfish: Caleb doesn't speak french that well  \nbblfish - (13:55): en ce qui nous concerne  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:55): (At all :) )  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:56): Watched almost all of the video, very funny.  \nbblfish - (13:56): ah sorry  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:56): He's just getting to the dnssec stuff.  \nbblfish - (13:56): Yes, I was saying he mentions what I was tlaking about at the end  \nbblfish - (13:56): In the CCC at Xmas that is the main focus  \nbblfish - (13:56): Let me see if I can find that video  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:57): I still don't see why we need to mess with dns just to get ssl to work but I still have 5 minutes left on the video.  \nbblfish - (13:58): this http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3658.en.html  \nbblfish - (13:58): yes, he gets there right at the end  \nbblfish - (13:58): the next video goes into more depth  \nbblfish - (13:59): I am downloading that  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:00): I suppose you already know I get paranoid about new technology (especially when people want to force everybody on to the \"new internet\") My feeling is fix the problem with ssl, dns wasn't and shouldn't be about trust.  \nbblfish - (14:01): yes. as I say in the last few minutes he points out that you can use DNS-SEC to put your certificate in the DNS  \nbblfish - (14:01): but he just touches on it  \nsdumitriu - (14:02): Caleb, did you watch \"That 70's Show\"?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:02): I don't have tv :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:02): But I'm the phes guy right? Someone told me that.  \nsdumitriu - (14:02): Neither do I, but there's the internet  \nsdumitriu - (14:03): No, you're Hyde  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:03): I'll have to look up the wiki on Hyde.  \nsdumitriu - (14:04): My favorite guy  \nbblfish - (14:08): anyway he even has a wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan\\_Kaminsky  \nvmassol - (14:08): sdumitriu: and you're Jekyll?  \nvmassol - (14:09): :)  \nsdumitriu - (14:09): vmassol: I guess you didn't watch that 70s show either  \nvmassol - (14:09): nope  \nbblfish - (14:19): CalebJamesDeLisl: on that wikipedia page is a link to the DNS spoofing attack  \nbblfish - (14:19): and a wired article  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:20): Yea reading about Hyde. lol.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:39): Reading the wired article: \"could use an automated system to flood a server with an endless stream of guesses. With a high-speed connection, a week of nonstop attacking would likely succeed.\" c'mon a root dns server and nobody notices for a week that it's being flooded out by somebody's residential fiber line?  \nmarta left #xwiki at 14:46  \nmarta joined #xwiki at 14:46  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:50): bblfish: I read the article, I tend to take a lot of these super high profile secret security flaws with a grain of salt. Joanna Rutkowska found a cache poisoning attack on every intel processor since 486, Jack C. Louis found out how to knock over any server running tcp, weev figured out how to break firefox with recursive javascript. And yet the internet is still here.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:55): dns poisoning is only effective if we use dns for trust which is wrong and if Firefox were to simply store certificates from all ssl sites it viewed, the x509 attacks all become very unlikely to work.  \nbblfish - (15:03): CalebJamesDeLisl: I am just going to watch the CCC video again  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:03): I'm downloading your video now.  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 15:08  \nbblfish - (15:12): I think you will like it a lot  \nbblfish - (15:12): :-)  \nbblfish - (15:12): It's real good  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:15): I'm also hacking my firefox perspectives addon to store every server cert so the x509 attacks would only work if it's the first time you viewed the site.  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 15:45  \nvmassol - (15:50): jvelociter: not sure we should remove these warnings actually  \nvmassol - (15:51): you could upgrade it to 1.9 and later though  \nvmassol - (15:51): s/upgrade/update/  \nvmassol - (15:51): (but even that isn't necessary I think)  \njvelociter - (15:51): yeah.. I'm not very sure either. Maybe we should have them in a floating box on the right  \njvelociter - (15:51): (right now it's ugly)  \nvmassol - (15:51): yes, I think we need something normalized for the whole site  \njvelociter - (15:52): yep  \nvmassol - (15:52): some icon that gives the version in it  \njvelociter - (15:52): but we are going to redesign the extensions site aren't we ?]  \njvelociter - (15:52): :)  \nvmassol - (15:52): it's not for extensions only  \nvmassol - (15:52): it's for any content  \njvelociter - (15:52): yes it's for everything  \nvmassol - (15:52): on the whole xwiki.org farm  \njvelociter - (15:52): so it needs to be in the skin  \njvelociter - (15:52): (or IX)  \njvelociter - (15:53): an object of type XWiki.SinceClass or something  \njvelociter - (15:53): and hop automagically we add the warning  \nvmassol - (15:53): sinceclass is too coarse grained  \nvmassol - (15:53): I think we need annotations actually :p  \njvelociter - (15:53): I rolledbacked the doc for now  \nvmassol - (15:53): (or something similar)  \njvelociter - (15:54): you mean from the annotation feature ?  \nvmassol - (15:54): since a potion of doc can be related only to a specific version  \nvmassol - (15:54): \\*portion  \njvelociter - (15:54): yep  \nvmassol - (15:54): yes I mean as in the annotation feature  \njvelociter - (15:54): but you also want to say \"this whole feature described in the doc\"  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): Really weird behavior here... I have this code:  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): #macro(elementMetaData $element)  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): \u00a0\u00a0#themePropertyClasses($element) #inlineStyle($element)##  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): #end  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): Which generates something absurd. If I add another letter, like in:  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): #macro(elementMetaData $element)  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): asd  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): \u00a0\u00a0#themePropertyClasses($element) #inlineStyle($element)##  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): #end  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): it suddenly works better. If I remove the extra line and save again, it goes right back to the absurd result  \njvelociter - (15:54): you want both  \nvmassol - (15:54): so either annotations or  \nvmassol - (15:55): some special verrtical margin  \nvmassol - (15:55): that can have version icons in it  \nvmassol - (15:55): and the text on the right of that margin would be for the version specified in the margin  \nvmassol - (15:55): (or on the left if the margin is located on the right of the screen)  \njvelociter - (15:56): for portion of text I agree annotations are ideal  \njvelociter - (15:56): though maybe a bit modified  \njvelociter - (15:56): since you don't want to associate it to a particular author I guess  \nvmassol - (15:57): why not?  \njvelociter - (15:57): or rather you don't want to display that association  \njvelociter - (15:58): i'd say because it's not very relevant  \njvelociter - (15:58): but yes you can display it  \nvmassol - (15:58): it's important to know who made a change  \njvelociter - (16:00): yes it's relevant for us  \njvelociter - (16:00): \"authors\"  \nsdumitriu - (16:05): vmassol, jvelociter: In my fix for XWIKI-4960 I removed any : introduced by a guest user in the username (to prevent impersonating another user)  \nsdumitriu - (16:06): This means that URLs used as guest names will be broken  \nsdumitriu - (16:06): Is that OK?  \njvelociter - (16:07): then we maybe need a \"homepage\" field in the comment class  \njvelociter - (16:07): it's good value to provide this link, especially when commenting as guest  \nsdumitriu - (16:08): Yep  \njvelociter - (16:08): you want to know who really is the person  \nsdumitriu - (16:08): OK, good idea  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:09): sdumitriu: did you test with \"XWiki.XWiki.Admin\" ? ;)  \nsdumitriu - (16:09): But otherwise, any points agains removing : ?  \nsdumitriu - (16:09): Caleb: Wow, good catch  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:09): That's why I didn't try to fix it. You need a loop.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:10): Then you have to handle XWXWiki.iki.Admin  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:10): (If you remove XWiki. from the middle that is.)  \nsdumitriu - (16:10): No, that's just from the start  \nsdumitriu - (16:10): Hm, how about just removing all the dots, too?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:10): I decided it was a mess and gave up.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:11): I think you're safe if you remove all : then remove \"XWiki.\" from the start but do it in a loop.  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 16:25  \nanamarias left at 16:26 (Remote host closed the connection  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 16:26  \nbblfish - (16:27): ok, just watched that video again. He starts off explaining a lot better the importance of DNSsec. He does not go into details about why it is going to be implemented. I think the other HAR talk did that  \nbblfish - (16:35): I think the big talk about why DNS is fatally broken is http://bert-hubert.blogspot.com/'s talk http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/camping\\_and\\_hacking\\_at\\_har2009  \nbblfish - (16:37): the pdf is here http://bert-hubert.blogspot.com/2009/08/har2009-thoughts-returning-back-to.html  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:40  \njvelociter - (16:47): vmassol: do you have a snippet to delete spam users ?  \nvmassol - (16:47): yes  \njvelociter - (16:47): found a very spammed wiki on myxwiki.org  \nvmassol - (16:47): both on xwiki.org and on myxwiki.org  \njvelociter - (16:47): it's published?  \nvmassol - (16:47): hold on  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:55): bblfish: Does this mean flashing all of the home dsl boxes?  \nbblfish - (16:55): ah yes, those are the weakest points. A FroSCon there was a great talk on how to halk those with javascript  \nbblfish - (16:56): see the talk \"http://programm.froscon.org/2009/events/323.en.html\" http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/froscon\\_the\\_free\\_and\\_open  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:56): But dnssec will require reflashing them all?  \nbblfish - (16:57): no, I think they solve the main routers first, then the OSes will slowly be upgraded  \nbblfish - (16:57): one problem at a time  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:58): So no security until every modem supports it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:58): Sounds like ipv6. It might be a nice idea but it's going to stay that way.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:00): My only real opposition to dnssec is because of the problems which we don't yet know about. Most of the DNS issues are resolved, with DNSSEC we get to start over.  \nbblfish - (17:03): watch those videos  \nbblfish - (17:04): dns wihtout port randomisation can be broken in two sec  \nbblfish - (17:04): with port randomization in 10 hours  \nbblfish - (17:04): that is slide 21  \nbblfish - (17:05): Bert Hubert is quite good, and I think the third video there points to another one  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:05): Just think of all the people just like me working at the ISPs and backbone companies who know what they know and don't like new tech :)  \nbblfish - (17:05): yes none of those speakers like DNSsec  \nbblfish - (17:05): they say so  \nbblfish - (17:05): but it is unavoidable  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:07): I think the way the isp and backbone people see it is it's either working or it's broken. If it's broken then we must fix it as soon as possible (not a time for upgrade). If it's working then all you possibly could do is break it.  \nbblfish - (17:07): let's discuss this in one year  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:08): You think there will be major change in a year's time?  \nbblfish - (17:08): that's what the top guys in the field are all saying  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:10): I'll become more interested when I hear cogent, level3, globalcrossing etc. start pushing it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:17): Actually dnssec would be easy if it were implemented opendns style. Not sure if/how that would work.  \nanamarias left at 17:20 (Quit: anamarias  \nbblfish - (17:20): http://bert-hubert.blogspot.com/'s is quite critical of it in his talk  \nbblfish - (17:20): He wrote an open dns  \nbblfish - (17:20): PowerDNS  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:22): I'm listening right now.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:22): I say opendns meaning opendns.org  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 17:36  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:07): bblfish: \"If you take a look at dns security vulnerabilities in the last 5 years most were dnssec.\" -bert hubert  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:07): I really liked his idea about just slapping one more id number on the dns packets.  \nbblfish - (18:09): the last talk on http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/camping\\_and\\_hacking\\_at\\_har2009 is a lot more positive - it also shows that a lot of big providers were deploying it a year ago  \nbblfish - (18:09): http://www.domainpulse.com/2010/03/18/org-to-enable-dnssec-by-june-2010/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:10): I'm in favor of it as long as they don't take down the old dns system, 2 systems are harder to spoof than one.  \nbblfish - (18:11): http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-27jan10-en.htm  \nbblfish - (18:11): http://news.techworld.com/networking/3214097/verisign-dnssec-to-improve-internet-security/  \nxenon751 joined #xwiki at 18:12  \nxenon75 left at 18:12 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:13): Hmm, so there's .com .org and .net  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:14): Unfortunately the root servers are the most highly maintained so it's the home routers that need better security.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:18): I guess breakable dns doesn't really matter as long as we have foafssl because a MITM attack would cause the user to be logged in as the wrong username.  \nheadache left at 18:20 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nbblfish - (18:22): CalebJamesDeLisl: that is where the trick of putting your public key in the DNS registry can do the final trick  \nbblfish - (18:23): so you put your domain public key in the DNS registry and now you no longer need CAs  \nbblfish - (18:23): so it is not worth solving that problem for the moment  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:23): But dnssec is so new and complex that I am for reversing the foafssl process to verify the server.  \nbblfish - (18:24): foaf+ssl verifies the user  \nbblfish - (18:24): dnssec the server  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:24): You got me interested and now you must pay the price :)  \nbblfish - (18:24): 2 different things  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:25): Suppose the user connects to the server.

It might be able to be implemented in a chrome extension.  \nbblfish - (18:40): I think he might be able to put it in chrome  \nbblfish - (18:40): for the next release :-)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:44): Chrome is 10% of the market, ff is 40 and ie is 30 I think I remember.  \nbblfish - (18:44): 10% in less than a year is huge!  \nbblfish - (18:44): They are advertising it on nearly every search page  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:45): Yea, they pushed it hard right from the start. I think it's a fad, we'll see.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:46): +1 for getting firefox to be a little less lazy, this new js engine is fast.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:48): If Chrome ruins IE then I'm all for it.
