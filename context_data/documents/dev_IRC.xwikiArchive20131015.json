Thus spamming the AD with authentication requests  \n09:16\u00a0<npst>\u00a0this (in my opinion) leads to slow responses  \n09:17\u00a0<npst>\u00a0is there a way to tell xwiki only to check for a valid user for non-static files, aka pages instead oof png, css ...  \n09:28\u00a0<npst>\u00a0(was that comprehensible? :D)  \n09:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0npst: what you could do is actually tell Apache to bypass XWiki for these  \n09:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Apache or whatever else you have in front of your application server  \n09:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wha authenticator are you using by the way ?  \n09:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what  \n09:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since there is no kerberos+LDAP auth in XWiki by default  \n09:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since the other solution is to improve the SSO auth your are using to store in the session the current user to not check the LDAP server all the time  \n09:39\u00a0<npst>\u00a0i'm using AppServerTrustedKerberosAuthServiceImpl, but it seems to work with AppServerTrustedAuthServiceImpl as well  \n09:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those don't access any LDAP server  \n09:40\u00a0<npst>\u00a0if i'm using the apache to bypass kerberos for those files, xwiki tends to get stuck in a loop of 200 and 401 return values (tries to log in the user for that file)  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they just get the request remote user and create the XWiki user when it does not exist  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I don't really understand why you talk about LDAP server access  \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they don't do the actuall auth in other words, it's whatever you put in front of XWiki that take care of it and indicate the user to XWiki  \n09:41\u00a0<npst>\u00a0indeed  \n09:42\u00a0<npst>\u00a0but my wiki should only be accessible to those authed by kerberos, so i deactivated guest access  \n09:44\u00a0<npst>\u00a0I actually don't know where exactly the problem is, all I see in the apache logs are a lot of forbidden or authorization required requests by anonymous, followed by the exact same request with user credentials  \n09:46\u00a0<npst>\u00a0since several of those requests are above the 500 ms mark (which indicates a socket timeout, say the internet), I'm trying to think of a way to reduce the amount of those requests  \n09:47\u00a0<npst>\u00a0And i thought allowing xwiki to present images and css files to non-valid users would be a good way  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as I said you can always configure apache to bypass XWiki for /resources/\\* urls but seems to me you have an issue with your kerberos authenticator  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0either that or the browser  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't know kerberos very well  \n09:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:59\u00a0<npst>\u00a0well, bypassing xwiki sounds interesting. would a new <Directory ...> entry be the way to go?  \n09:59\u00a0<npst>\u00a0(i'm new to all of this, not only kerberos :D)  \n10:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not an Apache expert either, let me check the doc, I just know it's possible to tell Apache that for a kind of URL it should go somewhere else  \n10:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds more like <Location>  \n10:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/fr/mod/core.html#location  \n10:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n10:04\u00a0<npst>\u00a0thanks, i'll look into that  \n10:05\u00a0<npst>\u00a0apart from that, i assumed that kerberos was the way to go for SSO, so i didn't dig into xwikis ldap features.  \n10:05\u00a0<npst>\u00a0were you hinting on using xwiki to access the windows AD directly?  \n10:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those are two different things  \n10:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n10:05\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:06\u00a0<npst>\u00a0i don't understand  \n10:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0LDAP still require a login/password  \n10:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0while main job of kerberos is to automatically authenticate the user without him typing anything  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and then kerberos itself rely on a LDAP database (Active Directory)  \n10:07\u00a0<npst>\u00a0i see  \n10:08\u00a0<npst>\u00a0so if i'd give my SSO/Kerberos stuff, ldap is the way to go  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0another SSO that seems to be used a lot on Windows is NTLM (but maybe it's another name for kerberos)  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0based on Active Directory too so it's pretty much the same idea  \n10:09\u00a0<npst>\u00a0yeah, I had NTLM before, but it's deprecated in Version 1 on current systems  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the other solution being to not setup SSO and ask user for login/passord with XWiki LDAP authenticator  \n10:10\u00a0<npst>\u00a0that's a good fallback plan to have, thank you again  \n10:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now I seen perfectly working setup of kerberos so I guess it's just about configuration but I can't help you much with that  \n10:12\u00a0<npst>\u00a0And I've seen people complain about low speed with kerberos, but no solution :D  \n10:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, I'm going to work on uprgading xwiki.org to 5.2  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone against?  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not, I'll start by putting xwiki.org in readonly mode while working on the upgrade  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok?  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: does this UIX support multiple implementors? http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ExtensionPoint/AfterHeaderUIX  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: don't prefer to test on myxwiki.org before ?  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes ideally it would be better but more work since my end goal was to upgrade xwiki.org for active installs ;)  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you think there's a risk?  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again I'm doing this on a separate VM  \n11:30\u00a0<npst>\u00a0nah, you'll be fine  \n11:30\u00a0<npst>\u00a0godspeed, brother  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so at worse the upgrade will fail and I'll just remove readonly  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well the other risk is that for ex it crashes every day after I instlal it  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'll put back the existing version and since there's been no DB changes (except for activeinstalls which adds a new table) it should be fine I think  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n11:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: wdym by \"implementors\"? it works like any other extension point. We look for all extensions that provide content for that particular point and display it. You can have ofc multiple menus or other things displayed after header. It wouldn't have much sense to use an extension point if it was limited to the menu application only.  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: just tested and it works  \n11:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0great  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys can you give me an ok for the upgrade or tell me it's too risky and i won't do it  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to decide  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: was an attempt to find someone to upgrade myxwiki.org ;)  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice try  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I may do it later on if I find the energy  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so does it mean you're ok for upgrading xwiki.org to 5.2?  \n11:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: +1 for the upgrade  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway green light for me for xwiki.org upgrade,  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks, starting  \n15:59\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:06\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n16:20\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n16:29\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: we need to configure SOLR on xwiki.org  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that it only searches in some wikis (as we used to do for lucene)  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do I do that?  \n16:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I don't think that's possible  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we'll need to add this feature  \n16:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you select the wiki from the advanced search, but there is no configuration  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there wasn't a ui either for mucene  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucene  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we could change the page code to provide a list of wikis  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Migrations#HOnwww.xwiki.org  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#set($allwikinamelist = [\"xwiki\", \"platform\", \"enterprise\", \"manager\", \"extensions\", \"dev\", \"contrib\", \"commons\", \"rendering\"])  \n16:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll create a jira  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now it's not nice becuase users see and search in wikis such as \"newwiki\", \"xclams,\" etc  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mf  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9559  \n16:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: that list is used just for UI, just to override the lists of wiki displayed in the select  \n16:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's not a feature  \n16:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it was simply customized for xwiki.org  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep that's all I need for xwiki.org  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was in the code  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0dipslay code  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I used it for xwiki.org  \n16:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so just edit Main.SolrSearch  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah cool  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's all I was asking for :)  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have a lock  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're doing it?  \n16:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm just looking over the code  \n16:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0force me  \n16:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0look for wikiSelector macro  \n16:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and instead of #set ($wikiNames = $xwiki.wikiNames)  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ideally all that will be based on hidden wikis gdelhumeau is introducing  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure tmortagne  \n16:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you put #set ($wikiNames = ['wiki1', 'wiki2', etc.])  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because xclams may not be hidden  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's jsut that we don't want to see it from xwiki.org  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: if we don't want to find it it should  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but maybe from some other locations we'll want to see it  \n16:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0actually, search for \"$xwiki.wikiNames\"  \n16:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0there are 2 occurances  \n16:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so it's best to define a global variable and use it in these two places  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't work mflorea  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the facets still show all wikis  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the results too  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you check what I've done?  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe I made a mistake  \n16:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you did the right thing  \n16:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0what is the problem exactly?  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only the listed wikis should be displayed  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[\"xwiki\", \"platform\", \"enterprise\", \"manager\", \"extensions\", \"dev\", \"contrib\", \"commons\", \"rendering\"]  \n16:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and?  \n16:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's what the select displays  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0try this: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Search?text=blog  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first link shows a result from xclams and the facets shows all wikis  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is NOT what we want  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and NOT what we had with lucene  \n16:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0your change was just for the UI of the filter  \n16:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(17:40:59) mflorea: vmassol: that list is used just for UI, just to override the lists of wiki displayed in the select  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're the expert just tell me what to change  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm just following your instructions  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I just want to change UI  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't care that internally it searches in all wikis ATM  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we must not show results from some wikis  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like playground, curriki, xclams, newwiki, etc  \n16:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0my instructions were just to restrict what wikis are listed in the select from the advanced filter  \n16:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and it works  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that's not enough  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what else can we do?  \n16:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, I don't see where lucene uses that list to restrict the search result  \n16:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0afaics it uses the list to restrict the select from the filter  \n16:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: can you check now?  \n17:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you can also check the diff  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep looking  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the good news is that with EM we shouldn't need to do the merge manually next time  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very cool  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems to work fine  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks mflorea!  \n17:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0np  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should I leave the issue open? could be interesintg, wdyT?  \n17:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you mean XWIKI-9559? I don't know.  \n17:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the question is if we want/need it in the platform  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems useful to me, now do we need this in addition to hidden wikis, i don't know  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n17:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not sure the right solution is to have a configurable list of searchable wikis. Could be a config in the (sub)wiki  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we have the need for xwiki.org then we need it  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it means the use case exists and it' sbetter to offer it for the user  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ideally we wouldn't have to change any code on xwiki.org  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example XWikiUserProfileSheet shouldn't be touched either  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also a list of wikis for which to dsplay the user AS  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO the way to deal with XWIKI-9559 is hidden wikis  \n17:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sure, but what I'm saying is maybe the config should be moved to the subwiki, saying \"I wasn't to be viewable/searchable from the main wiki\"  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep hidden wiki  \n17:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0s/wasn't/want  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: imagine that we have 3 subwiikis: xclams, curriki, education  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that from the education wiki we want to search in xclasm and curriki  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now from xwiki.org we don't want to search in these wikis  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you are describing a subfarm, maybe they should have their own...  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you mark them hidden then they're hidden for all use cases  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but having a configurable list of wikis at least allows for this use case  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's one more feature  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it can save users a farm it's all the best  \n17:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: with the current ui you cannot search in other wikis from a subwiki, only from the main wiki  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0having lots of farm is not the simplest  \n17:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so the \"from the education wiki we want to search in xclasm and curriki\" is not a supported use case  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right  \n17:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0a subwiki is able to search only in its documents  \n17:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ofc, at the API level you can specify in which wikis to search, so there's no limitation there, except maybe from some rights (programming rights?)  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: I think solr query API require PR right now anyway  \n17:15\u00a0<npst>\u00a0has quit  \n17:24\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n17:25\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:31\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: The links for the \"Latest product version tested\" don't show up here: http://test.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/QA/WebHome I think this is related to your 5.2 upgrade  \n17:31\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0it was working fine before afair  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: what links?  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n17:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0interesting  \n17:33\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0instead of [QA.XWiki 5\\.2 M2] there should be a link to http://test.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/QA/XWiki+5.2+M2  \n17:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it normal that it says it's HTM?  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0HTML  \n17:36\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I really don't know.
