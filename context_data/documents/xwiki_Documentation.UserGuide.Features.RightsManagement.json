These rights can be set at different levels: for the whole wiki or for a given space and its children.\n\nIf needed, it's even possible to write some [script](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/Scripting) to control programmatically exactly what users are allowed to do.\n\n*Example of the rights UI*  \n![GroupRights.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RightsManagement/GroupRights.png?rev=1.1)\n\nTo learn how to set up permissions, check the [Rights documentation in the Admin Guide](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/).\n\n\n"}
