 \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0irctc806: you can't define several AuthServices in xwiki.cfg but you can write a custom auth service that will test several AuthServices behind the scene  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for the login page it's a bit more complex since the authservice API only takes login and pass officially but you can hack something to pass other informations to your service using URL parameters, HTTP headers, etc  \n14:17\u00a0<irctc806>\u00a0thanks for the suggestions  \n14:17\u00a0<irctc806>\u00a0the fields are the same  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok then it should be easy if it's just graphical stuff, just need to override it I think  \n14:18\u00a0<irctc806>\u00a0okay I'll see and come back with congrete questions, thank you  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you\u2019re welcome  \n14:35\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:38\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:40\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n14:43\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0Denis G has finished a pull request to fix XWIKI-9403 \u00a0at \u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/142  \n14:44\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0maybe this is something for todays BFD ?  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh...  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forgot about BFD  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0crap  \n14:45\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, ok  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have 2 options: I prepare the jira/mail and we start working on BFD now or we postpone it to tomorrow  \n14:45\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0me too ... wanted to send a pull request for XWIKI-9400 and are now quite pressed to manage it ...  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?

 \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do 2 days BFD and devs decide to participate either today or tomorrow?  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: just saying, I doubt I will work on BFD tomorrow but I don't really care if people want to work on it tomorrow  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so I'll annonce the BFD for tomorrow but I'll take today into account for the results  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok for you tmortagne?  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm ok for the 2 days thing but it's sound a bit fuzzy for something that is supposed to be a standard event  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/it's/it/  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well if we keep today then we'll have 1-2 bug fixes (yours) which isn't enough  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we already skipped the BFD for the 15th of Aug  \n14:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sending mail  \n15:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n15:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: have you tried to upgrade to lucene 4.4 already? Elasticsearch requires lucene 4.4 and we're using 4.0 ATM  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(elasticsearch client java api)  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did not touched lucene, just looked at solr and solr upgrade is blocked by restlet  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0arg  \n15:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Hi  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if lucene gyys did not broke any API I guess you can upgrade it without upgrading solr  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0guys  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't work  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I get exceptions at startup  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Do you think WikiManager#createNeWiki() (that creates a new subwiki) should check if the user has the correct right to do it?  \n15:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0To me, it's part of the responsibility of that class.  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw not sure why ES client requires lucene, need to check that more  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: it's done in WikiManagerPluginApi  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and checking right is generally responsibility of the script service (in this case it's a plugin api but it's the same idea) and not the actual component  \n15:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok thx  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed rights should only be checked at boundaries to avoid overhead. Once you're inside you have all rights.  \n15:58\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Do you think we can create the workspace-template at the first lounch of xwiki ?  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: we used to but people complained  \n17:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0what was their complaints?  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(admins complains)  \n17:48\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0hello....  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: things like \"my wiki do things I don't control, it's not the way I create wiki, I don't need this template since I'm creating custom wikis, ...\"  \n17:49\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0im trying to install iframe macro extension but when i try to install it, i cant find the extension into the pannel administration  \n17:49\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0how can install it?  \n17:51\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0is it about this macro: \u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Iframe+Macro  \n17:52\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0\u00a0yes  \n17:52\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0im triying to find the extension  \n17:52\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0into pannel administration  \n17:52\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0it is not extension, it seems  \n17:52\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0its embedded?  \n17:53\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0not everything on extensions.xwiki.org is installable via Extension manager, only those with a big green \"Installable with the Extension Manager\"  \n17:54\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ithe iframe is a \"snippet\" that you can \"install\" by copy & paste the text in the \"Installation\" section, I think  \n17:55\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0excellent  \n17:55\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0thnx :) camil7  \n17:57\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0hm, seems macros have changed a bit since the time this macro has been written  \n17:58\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, unless it should be used inside of a {{velocity}} macro anyway - in that case you just copy & paste it into that {{velocity}} block  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: yes  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the installation instruction has been written for xwiki/1.0 syntax I think  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(which parse velocity by default)  \n17:59\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0if one wants to have it in the wysiwyg editor this needs a bit more clicking around  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it should be rewriten as wiki macro ideally I think  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and provided as XAR extension  \n18:00\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, yes, for xwiki/1.0 not even the {{velocity}} markers would be necessary \u00a0... but that is not recommended, of course  \n18:01\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0hm, how would one add l10n files for the xar ? \u00a0creating the macro page itself seems to be relatively easy ... (I hope, it does not work yet)  \n18:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Localization+Module#HRegisterawikitranslation  \n18:02\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks!  \n18:10\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0\u00a0Mariah: it is still not installable via extension manager, and UI is still englidh, despite of \u00a0tmortagne's pointer ... I struggled with stupid erros of mine  \n18:45\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0for now the \\*.xar attachment should be good enough for a test, will continue tomorrow  \n18:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n19:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n21:32\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:07\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:09\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:25\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
