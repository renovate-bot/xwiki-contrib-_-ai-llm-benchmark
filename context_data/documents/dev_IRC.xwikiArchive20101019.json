I had an idea this weekend and want to check if you think it is worth making a Jira ticket for:  \nkwoot - (09:20): adding a symbol for the newline character in the wiki-syntax-edit-mode. Sometimes it is unclear if there is a newline in the code. A special character/symbol shown for a newline can be very helpfull.  \nStulle - (09:20): hi, i keep getting a weird error on importing a file via the importer function: http://pastebin.ca/1966623  \nStulle - (09:21): any suggestions?  \ncjdelisle - (09:22): That's not an error I have seen before, what is the content which causes it to occur?  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 09:24  \ncjdelisle - (09:24): kwoot, I'm not sure if it's possible to change the display of the \\n char. If you know a way, by all means create an idea jira issue.  \nkwoot - (09:24): cjdelisle: will do. What section does this belong in?  \nStulle - (09:25): cjdelisle: basically it's just a word file that includes a picture (original is png) and some formulas (MS Equations)  \nStulle - (09:25): actually the error started popping up yesterday  \nStulle - (09:26): then it was just plain text without a lot of fancy formating... basically just a couple of bold, some headings and a few links in those docs  \ncjdelisle - (09:27): kwoot, it would be in the core project and in the \"component\" menu, choose \"Templates and User Interface\"  \ncjdelisle - (09:28): Stulle, are you trying to import a word document by copy-pasting it to the editor?  \nStulle - (09:30): nope, first i tried WYSIWYG import and then i tried Add Page Import  \nStulle - (09:30): but the error remains the same  \ncjdelisle - (09:30): IIRC, someone had some trouble with that but using OfficeImporter worked ok.  \nStulle - (09:31): well, it worked great for me until yesterday  \nStulle - (09:31): some time after i switched to the RC1  \nStulle - (09:32): although, IIRC, it did work at first but then suddenly fucked up  \nStulle - (09:32): brb  \ncjdelisle - (09:32): But if you have a page saved and it causes the error every time you view it, try editing it as wiki mode and get the code.  \ncjdelisle - (09:32): The renderer should not be throwing exceptions so anything which causes it to is of interest to us.  \ncjdelisle - (09:33): tmortagne, do you recognize this? http://pastebin.ca/1966623  \ntmortagne - (09:35): cjdelisle: yes i do, what version of xwiki core is this ?  \ncjdelisle - (09:35): RC1  \ncjdelisle - (09:35): This is Stulle's problem.  \ntmortagne - (09:37): hmm actually no i don't recognize precisely (mixed with another one), in any case as cjdelisle said any error in the xhtml parser is an important bug (it should never fail whatever the content) so it would be great if you could create an issue on http://jira.xwiki.org and i will look at that  \ntmortagne - (09:37): ( Stulle )  \nStulle - (09:38): re  \nkwoot - (09:38): okay. done. it is XWIKI-5593  \nStulle - (09:39): okay, the thing is i cannot switch to wiki mode in the WYIWYG editor after importing  \nkwoot - (09:39): BTW: Love the crypto stuff!  \nStulle - (09:39): and importing via page add is not working either  \ncjdelisle - (09:40): You're using it?  \ncjdelisle - (09:40): (crypto)  \ntmortagne - (09:40): Stulle: according to the error, th issue is in the XHTML parser not in wiki syntax parser, so what is needed is the XHTML (and that's why you can't convert from xhtml to wiki syntax)  \nStulle - (09:41): okay  \nStulle - (09:41): i'll create a ticket  \ncjdelisle - (09:42): If there is sensitive information in the document, you can try removing/replacing it and see what will still cause the error.  \ntmortagne - (09:42): Stulle: the best is that you provide in the jira issue a way to reproduce it all the time and it wil be fixed very easily  \nStulle - (09:42): okay, will do  \nStulle - (09:42): i'll just take another document that fails that has less material that might upset any organization (such as the ISO or IEC or so ;))  \nStulle - (09:48): i take it the current version of the office importer app is 1.16?  \nStulle - (09:53): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XAOFFICE-52  \nStulle - (09:53): d'you need anything else?  \ntmortagne - (09:54): it's actually not an office importer bug but a core one, anyway I will move it thanks  \nStulle - (09:54): okay, did not know, sorry for that  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 09:54  \nStulle - (09:54): also, i reported another bug a few days ago regarding improperly imported chars  \nStulle - (09:54): g2g  \nStulle - (09:54): later  \nrrodriguez left at 09:56 (Read error: Operation timed out  \nStulle left at 09:59 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 10:01  \nrrodriguez left at 10:09 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 10:10  \nsburjan - (10:19): vmassol: ping  \nsburjan - (10:19): or tmortagne  \nsburjan - (10:20): is the Extension manager still an experimental feature ?  \ntmortagne - (10:21): sburjan: yes it is  \ntmortagne - (10:21): and for a long time, there is a lot of work to do  \nsburjan - (10:21): okay, so I'll let it as an Experimental for the Release Notes  \nrrodriguez left at 10:22 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 10:23  \nsburjan - (10:25): tmortagne: I see that there are no new snapshots for 2.5 since 14 oct. 2.6 won't be released from trunk ? Or what sould I test and to be the most close candidate for 2.5 final ?  \nsburjan - (10:25): \\*2.5 won't be released from trunk  \ntmortagne - (10:27): sburjan: that's probably because sdumitriu forgot to add 2.5 to hudson  \ncjdelisle - (10:28): http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise/6433/console is ceased. killing...  \nsburjan - (10:29): tmortagne: I am checking on maven, and I don't see anything newer in snapshots since 14 oct  \nsburjan - (10:31): I am asking this because I see in the release notes : \"New macros for the Space List and Tag Cloud\", and I'd like to see/know which ones are new  \nsburjan - (10:32): and test them  \ncjdelisle - (10:36): <crazy idea> Imagine if the configuration was a groovy script which ran on start, practically any change you could imagine could be hacked into a configuration file.  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 10:37  \ntmortagne - (10:49): sburjan: again \"that's probably because sdumitriu forgot to add 2.5 to hudson\" so you no chance to have new build if nobody is building it  \nsburjan - (10:50): ok  \ntmortagne - (10:50): i need to finish something, i will look at that after  \ntmortagne - (10:50): unless someone else can take care of this  \ncjdelisle - (10:50): I can give it a try but hehe dunno what we'll end up with.  \ntmortagne - (10:53): cjdelisle: the easiest is to copy all 2.4 related builds  \ntmortagne - (10:54): (when you create a new hudson job you can copy one)  \ncjdelisle - (10:54): Cool. I'll do that in a minute.  \nsburjan - (10:56): I have an unrelated question: does anybody have any idea is HSQLDB or the JDBC driver has any build-in default on protection against multiple SQL queries that are executed in the same string ?  \ncjdelisle - (10:57): IIRC hsql no. Mysql yes.  \ncjdelisle - (10:58): allowMultiQueries is the mysql config parameter I think.  \nsburjan - (10:58): because I created a hsqldb app, but I not allowed to put multiple queries in the same string before execute()  \nsburjan - (10:59): I want to demonstrate how SQL Injection works (school project)  \nsburjan - (10:59): so basically i am able to print the database, but unable to make another select, drop, alter, insert  \ncjdelisle - (11:00): no pb, just abuse union ;)  \ncjdelisle - (11:01): '); drop table wxyz; commit; is dramatic but not what injection is usually after.  \nsburjan - (11:01): this is exactly I want to do .. drop a table :D  \nsburjan - (11:02): my problem is that the string I constructed end with a hardcoded '  \ncjdelisle - (11:02): Oh you need to get rid of a trailing ' char?  \nsburjan - (11:02): so I'll have to put something at the end that needs closing  \nsburjan - (11:03): well my string is constructed like this (\"select \\* from users where user ='\" + username\"' and password = '\"password\"';\");  \nsburjan - (11:03): something like this  \nsburjan - (11:03): so the last ' is hardcoded in the query  \ncjdelisle - (11:03): oh, so easy.  \ncjdelisle - (11:04): password = \"' or 1=1 or '' = '\"  \nsburjan - (11:04): basically I'd like to run : select + drop + something else that closes the '  \nsburjan - (11:04): thanks  \ncjdelisle - (11:05): oh that'll just give you admin. You need to drop a table. hmm.  \nsburjan - (11:05): I'll try it these days  \ncjdelisle - (11:05): This is the fun one:  \ncjdelisle - (11:05): SELECT document.name from documents where document.type = '$userInput'  \ncjdelisle - (11:06): $userInput = ... \u00a0can I remember....  \ncjdelisle - (11:07): ' UNION ALL users --  \nsburjan - (11:07): I'm limited to a user/password select \\* query  \nsburjan - (11:07): what is the -- mea ?  \ncjdelisle - (11:07): comment out the rest of the line.  \nsburjan - (11:07): I'veseen it in tutorials, but they never explained what was that  \nsburjan - (11:07): oh  \ncjdelisle - (11:08): dropping a table is a requirement?  \ncjdelisle - (11:08): http://81.22.99.132/sql-injection-cheatsheet-oku/page/3/ hehe love that.  \nsburjan - (11:09): basically I have a jsp, form, 2 input fields (user/pass) pressing the login button redirect to a servlet that makes the query, prints the queryString and print the ResultSet  \nsburjan - (11:09): and I can bypass it using anything' or 'a'='a  \nsburjan - (11:09): and I get the select to get the whole table  \nsburjan - (11:09): but unable to drop or insert :(  \nsburjan - (11:11): basically no even 2 selects in the same query don;t work  \nsburjan - (11:11): so I'm guessing there is some setting which allows only one query / execute()  \ncjdelisle - (11:11): postgres or oracle are more fun. you can add a function to the database to email you all the passwords which are entered in the future.  \nsburjan - (11:12): lol  \nsburjan - (11:12): that's just sad  \ncjdelisle - (11:13): Functions are cool but easy to abuse.  \nsburjan - (11:13): but usually who enables these kinds of security measures (I'm talking about java) .. it's the JDBC driver that blocks this, or the DB Engine ?  \ncjdelisle - (11:14): the db engine is probably where you want to look.  \ncjdelisle - (11:14): postgres supports ); drop table students; commit; --  \nsburjan - (11:15): well .. my string closes a ' .. so I have to generate a query that need an ending ', right ?  \nsburjan - (11:16): == won't ignore the hardcoded ' :)  \ncjdelisle - (11:16): http://www.hsqldb.org/doc/guide/ch09.html#N124ED  \ncjdelisle - (11:17): oh very fun. user = \"r00t' --\"  \ncjdelisle - (11:18): hmm mysql is picky about the number of ' marks even if they're in comments.  \ncjdelisle - (11:18): dunno about hsql  \nsburjan - (11:18): well i chose hsql in the idea that it was the dumbest :)  \nsburjan - (11:19): so I could do anything  \ncjdelisle - (11:20): first rule of hacking is attack proprietary software ;)  \nsburjan - (11:20): All these types of comments are ignored by the database.  \nmflorea left at 11:20 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan - (11:20): so what, hsqldb ignores standard sql comments ?  \ncjdelisle - (11:20): I think ignored == treated as a comment.  \nsburjan - (11:21): oh  \nsburjan - (11:21): i thought that it didn't supported comments in syntax  \ncjdelisle - (11:21): neat, create a hudson job to create hudson jobs http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3886892/configure-or-create-hudson-job-automatically  \nStulle joined #xwiki at 11:27  \nStulle - (11:27): hey  \nStulle - (11:28): i'm back. if you need anything else regarding XWIKI-5594 just send me a message  \nsburjan - (11:30): cool stuff  \nStulle - (11:36): is there a way to center formulas in a line?  \nkwoot - (11:37): cjdelisle: regarding your earlier crypto question. I look forward to trying it out to have managers here sign pages to give it some official status. sorry for delay in answer. trying to do some other work here :-)  \ncjdelisle - (11:38): no pb. Great to hear someone's talking about using it.  \ncjdelisle - (11:39): You know if everyone has an email cert for PKCS7 then you can sign things from in the browser with js and the key never has to even sit on the server.  \ncjdelisle - (11:40): The only limitation is everyone has to trust their own key (firefox sillyness) which is not too difficult if you have a company CA.  \nkwoot - (11:41): cjdelisle: fact of life: harddisks wear out. So if some user has a \u00a0workstattion with a old disc he looses his key.  \ncjdelisle - (11:42): true enough. but another fact is that most attacks fall on the server so you can't trust a key on a server as much as one in a browser.  \ncjdelisle - (11:42): s/request/response/  \nkwoot - (11:46): all true. Now if only there was a good solution :-)  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 11:48  \ncjdelisle - (11:49): When it's all signing, you can just start trusting a new key. With encryption it's more difficult.  \nrrodriguez left at 11:49 (\\*.net \\*.split  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 11:50  \ncjdelisle - (11:50): PGP offers key recovery where a piece of the key is given to each of a number of trusted parties but that's for disk crypto.  \nStulle - (12:16): so is there a way to vertically justify/allign formulas in a text?  \ncjdelisle - (12:17): I don't know very much about the formula macro but I would be reaching for firebug and css if faced with that problem.  \nStulle - (12:19): mhmm thanks  \nrrodriguez\\_ joined #xwiki at 12:27  \nrrodriguez left at 12:27 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nrrodriguez\\_ is now known as rrodriguez ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nrrodriguez left at 12:28 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nrrodriguez\\_ joined #xwiki at 12:28  \nvmassol - (12:42): cjdelisle: I don't thin deprecation issues should be considered \"improvements\".

I put the id and version, press the Resolve button. i get a hierarchic list, and the press install.

 \nlucaa - (15:37): however we could have a getArrayList(Object[] ) next to the parameterless one, it would be cool  \nlucaa - (15:38): no, I don't think so, it's just about piping data, and well, conversions are sometimes needed  \nsburjan - (15:38): ok. deleted that folder, restarting xwiki .. re-creating procedure  \nlucaa - (15:38): I mean, needing a collection in a different format doesn;t mean I'm doing wrong things, I would say  \nvmassol - (15:39): nope but writing parsing logic in velocity might not be correct, depends on what you're doing  \ntmortagne - (15:39): sburjan: anyway looks like there is a bug even if you have already something in your local repository, i'm trying to reproduce with the same build as you  \nlucaa - (15:39): split you mean?  \nsburjan - (15:40): I have revision 31840  \nvmassol - (15:40): yes  \nlucaa - (15:40): well, then we need a standard method to pass & get macro parameters which are lists  \nvmassol - (15:40): why do you need to split in the first place?

Otherwise we end up with xwiki-core\u2026. ;)  \nmflorea - (15:48): I'll use Sandbox for target space and Foo for target page  \nStulle - (15:48): yep  \nStulle - (15:48): (side note: just tried it on IE8 and it failed too)  \nmflorea - (15:49): I click import and the import succeeds  \nStulle - (15:49): what browser?  \nvmassol - (15:49): note to self: knowing Anca, I'm pretty sure I've angered her by now\u2026. sorry Anca, it wasn't personal just a remark I'm making to myself\u2026. don't take it personally ;)  \nmflorea - (15:49): let's see, I'm using IE 7.0.5730.13  \nStulle - (15:50): O\\_o  \nStulle - (15:50): i don't get it  \nStulle - (15:50): like i said, i tried it with the standalone zip and a configuration i setup on tomcat with postgres  \nmflorea - (15:50): XE version is XWiki Enterprise 2.5-rc-1.31828  \nStulle - (15:50): and it fails on both with IE  \nStulle - (15:50): same here  \nmflorea - (15:51): the OS is WinXP SP3  \nsburjan - (15:51): Stulle: maybe you should gibe us the file that breaks for you.  \nStulle - (15:51): well it breaks for \\*all\\* docs i tried so far  \nmflorea - (15:51): but note that XE is installed on Ubuntu and I just access it from Windows  \nsburjan - (15:51): okay...  \nsburjan - (15:51): trying now  \nStulle - (15:51): like i mentioned in the ticket, it appends the entire local string rather than just the file name  \nmflorea - (15:51): sburjan: from the stack trace the problem is not related to a particular office file  \nStulle - (15:52): exactly  \nStulle - (15:52): i think it's about the link that is parsed improperly  \nmflorea - (15:52): Stulle: your XE is installed on Windows?  \nStulle - (15:52): because, to me, it looks something like {server upload dir}/C:/{dir}/{file}  \nStulle - (15:53): it is  \nStulle - (15:53): but please also note that it works if i use Opera 10.63!  \nsilviar left at 15:54 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne - (15:54): looks like extension manager install issue is due to a bug in documentAccessBridge.hasProgrammingRights(), it returns false when if should return true here  \ntmortagne - (15:54): anyone remember something modified around hasProgrammingRights ?  \nsburjan - (15:55): mflorea: we should test this on a windows machine .. I mean server running on windows  \nmflorea - (15:55): Stulle: yes, this is most probably a IE bug. I remember that Asiri (who implemented the office import) had an issue with IE giving the full path as the file name but he fixed it.  \nStulle - (15:56): Well, it appears the bug is back... i love that about coding myself ;)  \nStulle - (15:57): @ tmortagne about Programming rights, IIRC, you need those rights to be allowed to start/stop/restart/connect/disconnect OpenOffice.org server... well, does not work for me in RC1, either...  \nsburjan - (15:59): mflorea: installing OO on a win machine and try it there  \ntmortagne - (15:59): Stulle: i think there is something special with office importer actually  \nStulle - (15:59): might be...  \ntmortagne - (15:59): anyway i'm currently debbuging documentAccessBridge.hasProgrammingRights(), will see  \nStulle - (16:00): sburjan: btw, the detection of the proper OO.o path on x64 systems seems to be broken... i had to manually set that  \ntmortagne - (16:00): hmm might be the same thing actually  \ntmortagne - (16:00): sburjan: could you try on XWiki/ExtensionManager page instead of admin UI  \nsburjan - (16:00): Stulle: the automatically detection fails on linux too .. we can't fix that .. it's not us  \ntmortagne - (16:00): i think the right is not properly check when in admin UI  \nStulle\\_ joined #xwiki at 16:01  \nStulle\\_ - (16:01): ah, sorry, hit the wrong key...  \nStulle\\_ - (16:01): could you repeat that?  \nsburjan - (16:01): Automatic path detection is done by a package that isn't written nor supported by us.  \nStulle\\_ - (16:02): ah, i see, so no point in telling you it might not work on x86 either. ;)  \nsburjan - (16:02): tmortagne: let me find the page without admin UI  \nsburjan - (16:02): Stulle: unfortunately no :(  \nStulle\\_ - (16:02): anyway, documenting this a bit better might be useful!  \nStulle\\_ - (16:02): because i actually did it try and error  \nsburjan - (16:03): well , we encourage setting the path manually in xwiki.proprieties file  \nStulle\\_ - (16:03): that's how i did it now... on x64 apropriate paths for a standard OO.o install are as follows  \nStulle\\_ - (16:04): openoffice.homepath=C:/Program Files (x86)/OpenOffice.org 3  \nStulle left at 16:04 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nStulle\\_ - (16:04): openoffice.profilePath=C:/Users/{admin user}/AppData/Roaming/openOffice.org/3  \ntmortagne - (16:05): ok so the issue with both OO and ExtensionManager is that admin right is checking on XWiki.XWikiPreference and that XWiki.XWikiPreference page author is XWiki.XWikiGuest  \nStulle\\_ - (16:05): where {admin user} is preferably the administrating user who installed and ran OOo under his name...  \ntmortagne - (16:05): there is two issue here for me  \nStulle\\_ - (16:06): maybe someone would care to add that to the OOo docu...  \nsburjan - (16:06): tmortagne: testing now  \ntmortagne - (16:07): sburjan: pretty sure it will work, extension manager has exactly the same issue that OO  \nsburjan - (16:07): Stulle\\_: users can install where they want their OO, and by adding hardcoded paths will not help much.  \nkwoot left at 16:07 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nsburjan - (16:07): tmortagne: WORKS !  \nsburjan - (16:07): :)  \ntmortagne - (16:07): which is a ConfigurableClass system bug IMO  \nsburjan - (16:08): so we shot 2 rabbits with one bullet ?  \ntmortagne - (16:08): sburjan: now that you installed it you should be able to see it in admin UI  \nStulle\\_ - (16:08): sburjan: you got me wrong there. i meant you could add the path to the documentation so users won't have to try-and-error figure it out  \nStulle\\_ - (16:08): like i did  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 16:08  \nsburjan - (16:09): tmortagne: yes, I see it  \ntmortagne - (16:09): sburjan: need to decide first what is the best way to fix that from security POV  \nlucaa - (16:09): tmortagne: I've been told that you have an opinion about list values for a macro parameter...  \nsburjan - (16:09): tmortagne: unfortunately, you are asking the wrong person, this is far beyond my capabilities and level of decision. you need a platform dev  \nsburjan - (16:10): Stulle\\_: well this is documented on the xwiki.org site.  \nsburjan - (16:10): on how to setup OO server  \ntmortagne - (16:10): sburjan: sure i was not really asking you, more myself ;)  \nlucaa - (16:10): I see 2 options now  \nlucaa - (16:10): 1/ syntax in the value of the parameter (comma separated, etc)  \nlucaa - (16:10): 2/ repeating a macro param multiple times with different values (like in http with get parameters)  \ntmortagne - (16:11): lucaa: AFAIK there is already a list syntax for macro parameters  \nsburjan - (16:11): tmortagne: :)) yeah .. rhetorical stuff :)  \nlucaa - (16:11): tmortagne: really?  \ntmortagne - (16:11): hmm it's actually maybe for arrays  \nlucaa - (16:11): do we have an example?  \nsburjan - (16:11): ok, at least now I can create the screenshots and move on  \nlucaa - (16:11): well, it doesn't matter, as long as I can pass multiple values for a parameter  \ntmortagne - (16:11): need to check exactly what is supported by BeanUtils  \nlucaa - (16:12): but could I do that with a wiki macro, which only has String parameters?  \ntmortagne - (16:12): sure that's BeanUtils job  \ntmortagne - (16:13): converts String into values  \nlucaa - (16:13): ok  \ntmortagne - (16:13): and there is a converter for array for sure  \nlucaa - (16:13): ok  \ntmortagne - (16:13): just need to find the syntax  \nStulle\\_ - (16:13): sburjan: well it's there but it's very vague for Windows users who have little or no experience with unix systems... anyway, it was just a suggestion...  \nsburjan - (16:15): tmortagne: 2 NEW issues. Uninstalling extensions FAILS within administration panel. Uninstalling extensions WORK from direct page, but you can't select multiple packages. Hitting uninstall on more than one, will take only the last one clicked  \ntmortagne - (16:16): sburjan: WDYM by select ?  \nsburjan - (16:16): clicking on the and adding them to the To be Uninstalled list  \nsburjan - (16:16): clicking on the uninstall button and adding them to the To be Uninstalled list  \ntmortagne - (16:16): it's not the way it's working  \ntmortagne - (16:17): this is listing you what need to be uninstalled if you uninstall the extension  \ntmortagne - (16:17): try to uninstall jruby for example  \ntmortagne - (16:17): since ruby macro depends on it, it's listed as extension to uninstall  \ntmortagne - (16:17): it's exactly like for install  \ntmortagne - (16:18): except that it's the opposite  \ntmortagne - (16:18): \" Uninstalling extensions FAILS within administration panel\" is not a new issue, it's the exact same issue than install  \nsburjan - (16:18): so it's checking for dependencies and removes everything that depends on it ?  \ntmortagne - (16:18): yes  \nsburjan - (16:19): yes.. same issue, but it affects other behaviours too  \ntmortagne - (16:19): it's actually the same behavior, the thing is the UI does not print a nice \"You don't have right to perform this action\"  \nsburjan - (16:19): Stulle\\_: well the same file is used for windows and linux too for setting up the path to OO  \nStulle\\_ - (16:20): i know. i was just thinking about adding like a dummy line \"this is how it could look like on win (x64)\" or something  \nsburjan - (16:20): oh, okay.. I'll take that into consideration  \ntmortagne - (16:21): lucaa: about array syntax \"The input syntax accepted by the parseElements() method \u00a0is designed to be compatible with the syntax used to initialize arrays \u00a0in a Java source program, except that only String literal values are \u00a0supported. \u00a0For maximum flexibility, the surrounding '{' and '}' \u00a0characters are optional, and individual elements may be separated by \u00a0any combination of whitespace and comma characters.\"  \ntmortagne - (16:21): cf http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/view/commons-beanutils/commons-beanutils/1.8.2/commons-beanutils-1.8.2-javadoc.jar!/org/apache/commons/beanutils/converters/AbstractArrayConverter.html  \nsburjan - (16:23): tmortagne: removing org.jruby:jruby or org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-core-rendering-macro-ruby will not delete all the other packages that were installed with this  \nlucaa - (16:23): tmortagne: \u00a0thanks, lemme do some tests  \nsburjan - (16:23): Stulle\\_: I will add a new box with default install paths of OO on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows 32  \nStulle\\_ - (16:24): nice!  \nsburjan - (16:24): so users should have a clue what to put there  \nStulle\\_ is now known as Stulle (8123cca2@gateway/web/freenode/ip.129.35.204.162  \nStulle - (16:24): yep, that'll be pretty neat  \nsburjan - (16:24): what is your 64 path (that is working for you)  \nStulle - (16:24): see above  \nStulle - (16:24): i posted it a bit up  \nsburjan - (16:25): thanks  \nsburjan - (16:25): and this is the default path ?  \nStulle - (16:25): basically it's like on x86 but \" (x86)\" is added after \"Program Files\"  \ntmortagne - (16:25): sburjan: you look at it the wrong way  \nStulle - (16:25): this is the default install path of OO.o 3.2.something on Win 7 x64  \ntmortagne - (16:25): nothing depends on xwiki-core-rendering-macro-ruby  \nsburjan - (16:25): great. thanks  \nsburjan - (16:25): written down  \nStulle - (16:25): cool  \ntmortagne - (16:25): so if you uninstall it nobody cares  \ntmortagne - (16:26): jruby does not need xwiki-core-rendering-macro-ruby to work  \nStulle - (16:26): and if somebody uses a localized XP i figure this is enough of a help for the person to figure it out by himself  \nsburjan - (16:26): tmortagne: so basically which is the package that will force remove the packages depending on it ?  \ntmortagne - (16:26): but if you uninstall jruby then it will uninstall xwiki-core-rendering-macro-ruby  \nsburjan - (16:26): yes, but the others remain, and afais they are unused  \ntmortagne - (16:26): because xwiki-core-rendering-macro-ruby can't work without jruby  \ntmortagne - (16:26): sburjan: the uninstall them  \ntmortagne - (16:27): they could be used  \ntmortagne - (16:27): you don't know that  \nlucaa - (16:27): tmortagne: is that supposed to work right now? just passing that syntax in a macro parameter and having the value as an array?  \nsburjan - (16:28): tmortagne: I understand what you say, but performing a clean uninstall means that these packages will have to be uninstalled one by one manually.  \ntmortagne - (16:28): lucaa: xwiki-properties is using BeanUtils so anything BeanUtil support is supported  \ntmortagne - (16:29): sburjan: don't forget that this UI is just a demo of the in progress extension manager framework  \nsburjan - (16:29): true  \ntmortagne - (16:29): uninstalling everything at once is just about a foreach in velocity  \ntmortagne - (16:29): that's not does really have anything with the framework  \ntmortagne - (16:29): s/anything/anything to do/  \ntmortagne - (16:30): also i don't think uninstall everything is a common use case  \nsburjan - (16:31): well you should be able to uninstall what you installed. \u00a0IMO.  \ntmortagne - (16:31): since the goal at some point is to distribute a very minimalistic core and you use extension manager to install all the rest  \ntmortagne - (16:32): sburjan: you are  \nsburjan - (16:32): oh, i see  \nsburjan - (16:32): I don;t know (yet) the full role of the extension manager .. so maybe this is why I look confused  \ntmortagne - (16:32): sburjan: for example you don't have any shortcut to uninstall everything in ubuntu  \nsburjan - (16:33): well when I say everything I refer to the packages installed with my module.  \nsburjan - (16:33): not others  \nsburjan - (16:34): but it seems like a repository structure .. so one smaller package could be used by 2 or more extensions  \nsburjan - (16:34): which could be good  \ntmortagne - (16:34): sburjan: yes but as i said extension manager future is no to stay some optional module to install seeveral small extensoions  \ntmortagne - (16:35): sburjan: you can see it exactly like what you have in ubuntu/debian/etc...  \ntmortagne - (16:35): that's the same gaol  \ntmortagne - (16:35): s/gaol/goal/  \nsburjan - (16:36): yeah ..  \nsburjan - (16:36): it's cool but power user feature  \nsburjan - (16:36): :)  \nmflorea - (16:39): Stulle: I think I know the problem. Office importer component is called with the file name taken from the file upload plugin. On IE the returned file name is something like \"C:\\Data\\Stulle\\Test.doc\". On other browsers the returned file name is Test.doc . The office import works on linux because /path/to/temp/dir/C:\\Data\\Stulle\\Test.doc is valid while it itsn't valid on Windows.  \nStulle - (16:40): well, thought it might be a problem like that  \nStulle - (16:40): so what i'd do would be to deprecate all redundant bits of the path  \nStulle - (16:40): aside of the filename  \nStulle - (16:40): however, my Java skills suck, I'm a C++ guy ;)  \nmflorea - (16:41): that's the job of the file upload plugin IMO  \nmflorea - (16:41): sdumitriu: do you know why file upload plugin doesn't strip the path in IE when returning the file name?  \nStulle - (16:41): well, like i said, i am not too much into the whole java and web stuff but the idea remains the same, no matter where to implement it, imo  \nlucaa - (16:42): tmortagne: I cannot make it, I tried:  \nlucaa - (16:42): {{recentchanges space=\"A, B\" /}}  \nlucaa - (16:42): {{recentchanges space=\"{~\"A~\", ~\"B~\"}\" /}}  \nlucaa - (16:42): {{recentchanges space=\"{\\\"A\\\", \\\"B\\\"}\" /}}  \nlucaa - (16:42): {{recentchanges space=\"{A, B}\" /}}  \nlucaa - (16:42): it's all strings, for a wiki macro  \nlucaa - (16:42): any ideas?  \nStulle - (16:43): well, last error - now i think this is really about the importer for one ;) - http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-5577  \ntmortagne - (16:43): lucaa: not really, i never used that, just seen there was support for it, maybe it's not enabled by default or something  \nlucaa - (16:43): ok  \nStulle - (16:43): it's rather trivial, annoying for (especially) German users, nevertheless  \ntmortagne - (16:43): just got rid of something, i'm can take a look  \nmflorea - (16:45): Stulle http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/faq.html#whole-path-from-IE I'll fix the issue  \nlucaa - (16:45): tmortagne: it's not really that urgent, I would say, I would be curious how it works because I don't like the idea that much, it can create escape problems, etc  \nlucaa - (16:45): (I need to go for an hour or so now, brb)  \nStulle - (16:46): cool, mflorea  \nStulle - (16:46): nice to see how a bit of nagging and windows can help solving trouble ;)  \ntmortagne - (16:51): cjdelisle: you closed XWIKI-5592 for 2.3.3 (i moved it to 2.4.4 thinking i used the wrong branch) but looks like you actually committed on trunk and i don't see an commit on 2.4 branch  \ntmortagne - (16:51): did you mean 2.6M1 ?  \ntmortagne - (16:52): (so also forgot to assign it to yourself, which I fixed)  \nvmassol - (16:52): sdumitriu: so what do we do for myxwiki.org?  \nvmassol - (16:53): (to restore it I mean)  \nvmassol - (16:53): sdumitriu: what have we lost? just the home page?  \nsburjan - (16:53): Stulle: can you check out the documentation to see if it's better ?  \nvmassol - (16:54): sdumitriu: QuickLinks panel seems wrong too  \nStulle - (16:54): just a minute  \ntmortagne - (16:56): cjdelisle: fixed the issue based on what i see on svn, modify if it's wrong  \nStulle - (16:56): should be great like that! i think anyone setting up an XWiki instance should be able to figure out the {user} bit for himself :)  \nsburjan - (16:57): yes, at least :) ..
