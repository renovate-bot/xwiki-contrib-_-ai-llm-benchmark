This chat is logged publicly, you're gonna win the email lottery!  \ndegro - (00:05): oops.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:06): Oh well, a name that short will get hit just by wordlist guessing.  \ndegro - (00:07): hah  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:09): I had an idea for an email service. You allow users to have aliases to their email address so when you use bad companies which sell your name (no names here but it's a river in Brazil) you can set up an address for doing business then disable it.  \ndegro - (00:10): sounds good, but the email service market is overflowing  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:11): True enough. Still spam is a problem. I think companies would like to be able to give a unique address to each user who loads the page.  \ndegro - (00:12): yeah  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:12): Then we could determine what ip addresses the spam spiders are running on by comparing the email address sent to with the ip that loaded the page.  \ndegro - (00:15): export/import worked just fine  \nanamarias left at 00:16 (Quit: anamarias  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:16): Good.

It will dump errors.  \ndegro\\_ - (04:32): you mean errors in the lang file?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (04:32): If regexs work then something like {{velocity[^}]\\*}</start>  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (04:32): Yes lang file errors.  \ndegro\\_ - (04:32): yeah, the tutorial says regex works  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (04:33): Cool.

I'm having some paragraphs and breaks out of nowhere  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (05:42): Ok.  \ndegro\\_ - (05:42): and yeah, it's gotten light for an hour or so, it's 6:42am  \ndegro\\_ - (05:42): just a sec, so I can set it up  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (05:47): ping when ready.  \nsdumitriu left at 06:52 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nDenis left at 07:04 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \ndegro\\_ left at 07:07 (Quit: Leaving  \nDenis joined #xwiki at 07:09  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 07:29  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 07:54  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 07:59  \ndegro left at 08:16 (Quit: degro  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 08:19  \nanna\\_ joined #xwiki at 08:39  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 08:45  \nsburjan\\_ joined #xwiki at 09:00  \nsburjan left at 09:01 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsburjan\\_ is now known as sburjan ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nvmassol - (09:20): CalebJamesDeLisl: hi  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:20): Hi.  \nvmassol - (09:21): quick question  \nvmassol - (09:21): do you think we need to run the register tests from admin + when there's no live validation on all the tests in Register Test to provee that they work?  \nvmassol - (09:21): it's just a question of speed  \nvmassol - (09:22): (I understand it's safer)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:22): If you stop testing adminAddUser, the lightbox can totally break and nobody will know (it happened.)  \nvmassol - (09:22): this is not what I said  \nvmassol - (09:23): there are 7 tests in RegisterTest  \nvmassol - (09:23): do they all need to run again to prove that the adminadduser work  \nvmassol - (09:23): (same question for live validation)  \nvmassol - (09:24): or would it be enough to run just 1 for ex?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:24): RegisterTest is with liveValidation on, test without livevalidation is pretty important because it proves there are no security holes.  \nvmassol - (09:25): yes yesy  \nvmassol - (09:25): I'm not suggesting we remove the notion of testing without livevalidation  \nfelix1 joined #xwiki at 09:25  \nvmassol - (09:25): just wondering if few tests can be executed with the same result  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:25): So you suggest not testing (much) with livevalidation turned on?  \nvmassol - (09:25): I'm asking since I haven't fully dived into these tests  \nvmassol - (09:26): I'm not suggesting anything yet  \nvmassol - (09:26): I'm asking  \nvmassol - (09:26): I'm asking the expert in this domain if we're not testing too much  \nvmassol - (09:26): :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:26): Well the way it works is RegisterTest has all of the tests and withoutLivevalidation and AsAdmin extend RegisterTest.  \nvmassol - (09:26): I know  \nvmassol - (09:26): but that's very easy to modify  \nvmassol - (09:27): takes 5 seconds  \nvmassol - (09:27): since you can control test by test which runs  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:27): Override tests with nothing?  \nvmassol - (09:27): nope  \nvmassol - (09:27): using a junit4 annotation  \nvmassol - (09:27): that lists which tests to execute  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:27): I see.  \nvmassol - (09:29): (not ethat I haven't done it so I don't know exactly)  \nvmassol - (09:29): but right now the question is more whether we need to re-run everything or if running less would yield the same confidence  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:29): I hate to remove tests which actually test different things. AdminAddUser uses code in Registration which is usually dormant.  \nvmassol - (09:29): can be done with @category: http://kentbeck.github.com/junit/doc/ReleaseNotes4.8.html  \nvmassol - (09:30): CalebJamesDeLisl: ok fine we can revisit this when the tests will really take way too long  \nvmassol - (09:30): it's not going to be long  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:30): It would be cool if it could choose tests to execute randomly.  \nvmassol - (09:30): that's easy to do in junit3  \nvmassol - (09:30): not sure how to do in junit4 though  \nvmassol - (09:30): actually  \nvmassol - (09:30): it's easy to do in junit4  \nvmassol - (09:31): using a custom @Rule  \nvmassol - (09:31): but let's not go there  \nvmassol - (09:31): sounds a bit too magic  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:31): Cool. Seems like the real answer is to add another executor.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 09:31  \nfelix1 - (09:32): Hi  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:32): Hi.  \nfelix1 - (09:32): what are the diff beetwen jsessionid and srid ?  \nfelix1 - (09:32): i don't understand why i've the both  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:33): I think they belong to the container (tomcat etc.)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:33): Meaning I don't know ;)  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 09:34  \nfelix1 - (09:34): oki ;)  \narkub joined #xwiki at 09:36  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:38  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 09:39  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 09:41  \nlucaa left at 10:07 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:08): re Register test: I think I can make those tests take ~half the time by stopping using sendKeys  \nvmassol - (10:08): CalebJamesDeLisl: but we need that no?  \nvmassol - (10:08): to simulate what the user does  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:08): I plan to at some point implement native javascript in FormElement (like selenium1)  \nsdumitriu left at 10:08 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (10:09): CalebJamesDeLisl: not sure what you mean but make sure to post on the webdriver mailing list  \nvmassol - (10:09): lots of knowledgable guys there  \nvmassol - (10:09): and they may have this done already or preparing it, or...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:09): I googled about slow sendkeys, someone said it was because it was firing all keydown, key up events.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:10): I think the best thing to do is use FormElement when possible and then we can do all speed hacks in one place.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:13): \\* crazy idea: make a screensaver which makes the computer rsync the code and execute tests until it's stopped.  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 10:13  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:14): abusenius: It looks like we're going to have to remove xml escaping of the space copyright.

The major concern is that XWiki syntax can't be run.  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 10:39  \nabusenius - (10:40): hm, where can I edit this copyright actually?  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 10:40  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:43): Space preferences.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:43): Upper left --> administer space.  \nabusenius - (10:44): in my case its only in global administration  \nabusenius - (10:45): there is nothing similar in space administration... strange  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:50): Hmm, looks like 5209 isn't quite fixed: http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/880/#showFailuresLink  \nvmassol - (10:51): CalebJamesDeLisl: some of these are caused by jv's change of yesterday  \nvmassol - (10:51): he introduced a regression a least in the creation of spaces  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:52): I was referring to the escaping test.  \nvmassol - (10:52): don't know if his changes account for all problems or only a subset  \nvmassol - (10:52): ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:52): I had to do some manual merging but I don't think that broke the patch.  \nsburjan - (10:59): hello vmassol.  \nsburjan - (10:59): do you have 5 minutes, I have a couple of questions  \nvmassol - (11:00): sburjan: shoot here and if someone knows he'll anser  \nvmassol - (11:00): answer  \nsburjan - (11:01): first of all. On a normal xwiki, not a farm, is there any superadmin user (that already exists from the install)  \nvmassol - (11:02): sburjan: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HEnablesuperadminaccount  \nvmassol - (11:02): (so answer is yes)  \nsburjan - (11:03): and in this condition, what is the meaning of the superadmin ? when running a normal wiki instalation  \nsburjan - (11:03): to recover and hacked/deleted admin account ?  \nsburjan - (11:03): \\*from a  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:07): Pretty much.  \nsburjan - (11:09): I see  \nsburjan - (11:10): so if theAdmin user is deleteded by accident/hack, there is still a chance for recovery  \nsburjan - (11:10): and the second issue is more like a suggestion  \nsburjan - (11:11): have you ever considered to auto-rename all the attaching files, to a lowercare extension ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:12): Because of the url spec?  \nsburjan - (11:12): fo examne .. XWiki sees example.PNG and example.png diffrent. This is because XWiki is case sensitive, but from a user POV, there shouldn't be any diffrence, or at least NOT from the extension perspective  \nabusenius - (11:12): CalebJamesDeLisl, I'll look at test failures once I finished merging all my branches  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:12): ^ windows user ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:13): Ok.  \nabusenius - (11:14): as a linux user I don't see why example.PNG and example.png should be the same file, would totally break my expectations ^\\_^  \nvmassol - (11:14): sburjan: if there' s no difference between lowercase and uppercase I wonder why both system exist and why we learn how to write using both at school :)  \nvmassol - (11:15): try this at schoole: I LOVE xwiki. Your teacher is not going to consider it's the same as \"I love xwiki\"  \nvmassol - (11:15): s/schoole/school/  \nvmassol - (11:15): ;)  \nvmassol - (11:15): you'll get some negative mark for wrongly using some uppercase where it shouldn't  \nvmassol - (11:16): (trying to rationalize it :-P )  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:16): My thinking is we should try to avoid changing the user's input. Maybe an optional filter would work though.  \nvmassol - (11:17): more seriously, this is a discussion for the mailing list sburjan in case you want to propose to change the current behavior. We'd need to agree on it.  \nvmassol - (11:17): but this raises more questions  \nvmassol - (11:17): as to whether MyPage is the same as myPage  \nvmassol - (11:17): etc  \nvmassol - (11:17): it's a pretty large change  \nsburjan - (11:17): as a linux user they are diffrent, but from the perspective of a web user, they shouldn't. basically the only thing I'm suggesting is a windows-style approach over the files' extensions  \nvmassol - (11:18): sburjan: it's not consistent  \nvmassol - (11:18): I don't see why we would do it for file extension and not space/page names for ex  \nsburjan - (11:18): MyPage should be diffrent from myPage, I agree on that  \nvmassol - (11:18): then I don't undertsand your point  \nvmassol - (11:18): what's your rationale?  \ntmortagne left at 11:19 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (11:19): I think you're maybe mixing a generic use case from a specific use case you'd want to have in your own wiki  \nsburjan - (11:19): because when tracking versions of files, PNG and png will be diffrent, and will be catalogued as distinct files, even if the filename(without extension) is the same  \nvmassol - (11:20): myattachment.png is diffrent from Myattachment.png  \nvmassol - (11:20): extensions are not special  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 11:20  \nvmassol - (11:20): they're not even considered as extensions  \nvmassol - (11:20): it's a single string  \nsburjan - (11:20): yes, but myattachment.png os diffrent from myattachment.PNG too, and this shouldnt happen (IMO)  \nsburjan - (11:20): \\*is  \nvmassol - (11:21): again what is the logic?  \nabusenius - (11:21): sburjan, have you seen matrix? there are no extensions :)  \nvmassol - (11:21): abusenius: exactly  \nvmassol - (11:21): :)  \ntmortagne - (11:21): very important point :)  \nvmassol - (11:21): sburjan: from xwiki's POV you can name your attacgment \"myattachmentwithnodotinit\"  \nsburjan - (11:21): yes, that is true...  \nvmassol - (11:22): (extensions don't exist as abusenius was saying)  \nvmassol - (11:22): (we only have a notion of filename)  \nsburjan - (11:22): the only thing I'm saying is that attachment versioning is affected by this.  \nsburjan - (11:22): yes... i understand  \nvmassol - (11:23): yes different names leads to different attachments  \nvmassol - (11:23): s/leads/lead/  \nsilviar - (11:23): i think what sorin means to say is that when you have Image.png with version 1.0 and you upload Image.PNG, Image.PNG will be uploaded separately also with version 1.0 instead of becoming version 2.0 for Image.png  \nvmassol - (11:23): silviar: I understand what sorin says  \nsburjan - (11:23): but same name with caiptal extensions leads to diffrent versions  \nsilviar - (11:23): ok :)  \nvmassol - (11:24): Image.png and image.png are also different  \nsburjan - (11:24): yes, exactly :P  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 11:24  \nmflorea left at 11:24 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (11:24): and MyPage and mypage are also different pages  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:24): It's an age old question, do we offend powerusers in order to protect newbies from their mistakes?  \nvmassol - (11:25): the real problem is that we have a current behavior  \nvmassol - (11:25): and changing it across the board would be a huge task  \nvmassol - (11:25): breaking lots of things for users  \nvmassol - (11:25): so I don't see it happening anytime soon  \nvmassol - (11:25): (assuming we wanted to do it)  \ntmortagne left at 11:26 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsburjan - (11:26): it was just a suggestion :P  \nanna\\_ left at 11:27 (Quit: anna\\_  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 11:27  \nvmassol - (11:27): sburjan: if you feel strongly about it you should take it to the devs list and make a proposal  \nvmassol - (11:27): (here it's just informal discussion that have no real weight on decisions - all decisions go through the list)  \nsburjan - (11:28): I'm not... I still have a lot to learn how XWiki handles these things.  \nvmassol - (11:28): and you're free to suggest as many things as you want  \nsburjan - (11:29): well, I will suggest things when I have new ideas .. hope I won't get to annoy you  \nmariusbutuc joined #xwiki at 11:32  \nabusenius - (11:37): CalebJamesDeLisl: re failing escaping tests, seems that you forgot to also apply the changes to skins/colibri/src/main/resources/colibri/menuview.vm  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:38): ahh right.
