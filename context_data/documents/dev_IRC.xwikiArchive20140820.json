 \n16:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Only maven-shared uses that class  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because if the problem is just maven 3.1.1 it's not a big deal  \n16:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Building with Maven 3.1 or 3.2 fails with class not found org.sonatype.aether  \n16:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Which is normal  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I googled for days  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0before finding the \"good way\"  \n16:13\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It wa renamed to org.eclipse.aether  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are very few instructions  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we need to move to aether  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n16:13\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, I found an even better way, but the change was bigger  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm on 3.2  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it works  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the CI works too (not sure what version it uses though)  \n16:13\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Use the dependency-tree module  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah it's only some mojo failing?

 \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it's possible that I have updated to 3.2+ but didn't run a functional tests\u2026 strange though since I do that regularly...  \n16:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway thanks for fixing this  \n16:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:25\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: IRCBot func tesst still fail for me, normal?

I`ve fixed other deprecations but this one does not seem to have an immediate replacement as far as I can see. Need to look better into that. sdumitriu might have a good idea about this since I think I found one of his replies on the velocity-user mailing list on the topic. sdumitriu do you know of any replacement for org.apache.velocity.tools.generic.ListTool in velocity-tools 2.0?  \n16:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Enygma`: There's no replacement, every method that ListTool had is now supported natively, since arrays[] are treated as Lists  \n16:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0sdumitriu: will have to look at that tomorrow.
