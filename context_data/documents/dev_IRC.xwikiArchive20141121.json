(blocker)  \n16:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it is a feature that was introduced around 6.3 and that lived for about 1-2 minor versions maxed  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a regression and I know it's used by some users  \n16:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since we`ve quickly reverted that change that introduced that \"feature\"  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've reverted something?  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I missed that  \n16:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0wdym?  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought we broke it involuntarily  \n16:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that \"feautre\" was introduced by putting the Add Menu in the document content  \n16:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we`ve \"reverted\" that decision by moving the Add menu back in the Top menu  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but tht's different  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we never thought about this consequence  \n16:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0most likely http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10475 would be the right fix for this  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure if we're prepared to do that one quickly, it would be awesome  \n16:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:39\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<Slash\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: cool! would be nice to update http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI too.
