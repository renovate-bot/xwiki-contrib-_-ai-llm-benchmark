See my last mail on devs regarding the release. Let me know if there are any blockers and if you think it's ok to wait 2 more days for XWIKI-11176. I also need to get the status from Edy.  \n10:12\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, not fully through my mail, thanks for the heads up  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: the way XWIKI-10446 is described is a bit fuzzy, it's just that it require PR and you can give wiki creation right to a user that does not have PR  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's the exact same issue with any other document that require PR  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nothing really new here  \n10:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, vmassol listed some options in his last comment  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I saw them but IMO the first issue which he did not listed is hat this UI require PR  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which make it part of AS rewrite  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually he listed it second  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did not saw it  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't like too much the last \"solution\"  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that we are also talking about a wiki which is not created from a template  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so this is 2 constraint that makes it not really the most common use case  \n10:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0wikis created by a non-PR user is probably not a common use case (although you can give wiki creation right to any user, in practice the main wiki admin takes care of creating the subwikis). That doesn't mean we shouldn't fix this, but it's not critical.  \n10:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes that's what I saying and again you should not have the issue when creating the wiki from a wiki template even with a user that does not have PR  \n10:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since it's supposed to copy the exact document from the template  \n10:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the second solution (trying to get rid of programming rights for all XE pages) looks like lots of changes ... not sure if this can be done even in two days  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: this issue is only talking about AS, not the whole XE (even if as I said I don't see why it would be so critical for AS and not the others)  \n10:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, I meant that too, it is somewhat pointless to fix it for the activity stream and leave parts of the document index broken  \n10:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by the way having page requiring PR in XE always been a bug  \n10:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the fact that people still don't care and continue using it when it's not justified does not make it right...  \n10:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0is the \"no PR in XE pages\" documented somewhere? I just know because I have been told I should not use it  \n10:41\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is not really any \"XE rules\" documentations AFAIK, the closest would be http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/ApplicationDevelopmentBestPractices  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(which talk about PR)  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\u00a0but it's pretty obvious that when you use PR you prevent any subwiki admin to manipulate your page/extension  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:50\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:07\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n13:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0apparently we have a blocker that we have missed: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11019  \n13:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: sounds like PR issue again  \n13:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and again something for which it does not make sens to require PR...  \n13:53\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe if we want to fix that, we should dedicate a BFD for it ?  \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we could  \n14:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a PFD :)  \n14:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:18\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for the active contributors gadget I had to do a select at the time since I had no other way of getting that info  \n14:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it probably could be refactored now.  \n14:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11376  \n14:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok thanks  \n14:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:10\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:11\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n16:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:32\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:27\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:10\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:35\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:42\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n22:46\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:08\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n23:18\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:27\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n23:27\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n23:48\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:50\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
