I think is better to referentiate the initial issue  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure, could also have been a commit on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XINFRA/component/12842  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's fine  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't need more jiras\u2026  \n14:14\u00a0<KwootAtWork>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<KwootAtWork>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:40\u00a0<sorinello\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:40\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:58\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:59\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0Hi. How do I get the ID of the current page? I'd like to add a nav tree to the sidebar that opens up to the current document. $doc? $doc.id()?  \n14:59\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0is now known as <Signum>  \n15:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:06\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0oh, wait I got it\u2026 {{documentTree showAttachments=\"false\" finder=\"true\" openTo=\"document:$doc.getDocumentReference()\" /}}  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check the Panels.Navigation panel which does this  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0## Escape special characters in macro parameter values.  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#set ($openToDoc = $doc.documentReference.toString().replaceAll('([~\"])', '~$1'))  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Signum)  \n15:22\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: for the history part, maybe you could link to http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/ContentOrganization#HHistory  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of rewriting it  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if it's missing some info, add it there maybe  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least it should be linked probably  \n15:24\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:36\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:19\u00a0<amack2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:29\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Hmm, is there a way to re-order pages? I'm writing documentation and am trying to arrange the sub pages in a certain order.  \n16:30\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0(7.4.1)  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean in the tree Signum?  \n16:30\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Right.  \n16:31\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0The documenttree macro supports moving pages\u2026 but the changes do not get saved (the documentation confirms that).  \n16:31\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Or does xwiki not have a notion of order?  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems the order it based on the name or title  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/it/is  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually name  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not title  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I don't think the document tree maro supports any different ordering  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*macro  \n16:33\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Hmm, the page titles are \"1. foo\", \"2. bar\" and \"3. baz\". The order appears to be random like 3/1/2.  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the screenshots seem to suggest ordering on name but I haven't checked the code  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be simply ordered on when the pages were added to the store  \n16:35\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Bummer.  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm checking source code  \n16:37\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Thanks.  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Signum: I tracked it to https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/464e4fc1ec7eff8782c86909cb89da575a285a89/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-index/xwiki-platform-index-tree/xwiki-platform-index-tree-macro/src/main/resources/XWiki/DocumentTreeMacros.xml#L416-L416  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there's an order defined  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to understand 3, 2 1, refer to  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe the select items  \n16:45\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Sounds like some legacy ordering from <7.1 with spaces and stuff.  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the macro supports both  \n16:46\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Do you think the order can be overriden by changing variables in the page?  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just need to change the order by  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie the $orderByClause value  \n16:47\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0I'm really no xwiki guru. Been using Confluence for a while and otherwise am using other programming languages. :(  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:47\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Something like that, yes.  \n16:47\u00a0\\*\u00a0Signum tries to get $orderByClause  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO what you shoud do is create a jira issue  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0explaining your need  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the need for the document tree to have some configurable ordering  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*document tree macro  \n16:49\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Makes sense. I thought it was a pretty common requirement. Confluence uses a drag'n'drop view of pages in a space, too. But I don't mind being the first one. :)  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0drag and drop is hard because it means a manual ordering  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus you need to save that manual ordering somewhere and keep it up to date with page renames/deletes/etc  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be a nice feature though  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that if you need a menu with a defined ordering that's easy to do  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with a panel and wiki ilnks inside)  \n17:17\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:18\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0vmassol: Yeah. The DocumentTree macro claims that it support drag/drop but will implement the \"save\" feature later. Probably because it's non-trivial. :)  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0marius is the man but he's on holidays ATM  \n17:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<amack2>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:50\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n22:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:26\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n23:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n23:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n23:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
