I think I just moved a nullpointer from one point to another which is caused by the fact that Solr receive an event about a property that does not exist  \n08:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(which is not something new)  \n08:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n09:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: it happens on 5.1m2 so I could report it under that version if you want me to  \n09:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: ha I read you message too quickly, I tough you were testing a snapshot  \n09:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0:)  \n09:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's possible I fixed that yesterday actually  \n09:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's why I read your message too quickly, I tough I had introduce a new bug related to what I modified yesterday  \n09:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok then I'll retest on a snapshot when I have time  \n09:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I understand  \n09:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: you should probably test only snapshot  \n09:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0there was a talk about this subject  \n09:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0whether I should always test on the newest snapshot or not  \n09:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'm supposed to test fully 5.1m2...  \n09:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I must have missed that talk  \n09:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I understand this for stable things but Solr is in progress and there is always several differences between last snapshot and last release  \n09:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I see.

No, we don't have. If you want to see all versions a test has been run on, you have to go to the test's page  \n10:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: good morning. I spoke to tmortagne earlier this morning and he said I should always test on the latest snapshot. I know we talked about this some time ago, but nothing was decided. Do you want me to test on the latest snaps from now on ?  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: what I said exactly is that testing M2 is useless for thing in progress like Solr  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but in general I don't really see the point in testing a milestone as soon as there is modifications in the snapshot  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: yes, what's useful is to test before a release obviously so indeed testing latest is always better, you just need to be careful and sync with us when we have unstable things  \n10:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: ok then. I'll do that from now on  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why I mentioned being able to test timestamped snapshots with some verisioning like 5.1-<date>  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is also why I asked for version filtering in the LT  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that you can enter \"5.1\" and get all tests done during 5.1  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(during 5.1 dev I mean)  \n10:17\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0makes sense  \n10:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: ATM is not implemented, and it's gonna be hard to make this filtrable/sortable  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:55\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: we need filtering on columns of http://test.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/QA/XWiki+5.1+M2  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex, I wanted to see all tests done on oracle  \n11:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Ok, I'll try to do that ASAP  \n11:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0FTM you can use sorting, at leasy toy'll have all the Oracle tests grouped  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: do we have any doc on xwiki.org that explains version ranges for extensions what is supported?  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ludovic just asked me about this  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex are all the ranges from maven supported?  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Dependency+Mediation+and+Conflict+Resolution#DependencyMediationandConflictResolution-DependencyVersionRanges  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I don't think there is a doc no and yes all ranges from maven/aether are supported  \n11:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's basically a fork of AETHER version range parser but more extensible  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and of course to not depend on aether  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I remember it wasn't based on aether which is why I wasn't sure about the support levle  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*level  \n11:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: it seems your commit fixed my issue  \n11:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the shutdown issue  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you could add the doc somewhere on xwiki.org it would be great tmortagne  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0one difference is that 1.0 means \"1.0 or more with a preference for 1.0\" while in maven it means \"I prefer 1.0 but if you have anything else it's ok too\"  \n11:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0now it seems working like a charm  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: ok  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: sure  \n11:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: what was the actual thread blocking the shutdown ?  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: not sure, I got a bunch or behavior that did not made any sense when debugging so I removed all the advanced code to stop the threads and just made them daemons  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(daemon=you don't care they are running you can stop)  \n11:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: Insufficient code coverage for INSTRUCTION: 48.99% < 49.00% on sorl API :) (close but not enough :) )  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: yes I seen it  \n12:04\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0is it possible that the rendering of the document is done when I call doc.save() ?
