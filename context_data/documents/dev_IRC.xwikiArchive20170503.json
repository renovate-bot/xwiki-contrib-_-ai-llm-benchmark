The issue I see here is that the page title of XWIki.WebHome inside the \"curriki\" wiki is using a deprecated/removed translation key. Seeing DW hints that it was not really migrated and Solr probably has it still indexed.  \n15:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so it`s more of a data/configuration issue  \n15:45\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0hmm how come we have curriki indexed on xwiki.org? We should probably remove that  \n15:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(solr indexes it in the results, but the actual breadcrumb/location display is done live)  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0we should remove curriki for sure :)  \n15:46\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0I'mpretty sure I did that in the past though, strange  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0it's redirected to xclams but the wiki exist  \n15:52\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0need to remember where it's configured...  \n15:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0mflorea: any idea?  \n15:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0I don't see anything on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/Main/Search?editor=wiki  \n15:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ah maybe SolrSearch  \n15:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ok found it  \n15:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0XWikiOrg.SolrSearchConfig  \n15:54\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0so it shouldn't be indexed!  \n15:54\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0#set ($wikisSearchableFromMainWiki = ['xwiki', 'platform', 'enterprise', 'manager', 'extensions', 'dev', 'contrib', 'commons', 'rendering', 'snippets'])  \n15:54\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0see http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/XWikiOrg/SolrSearchConfig?editor=wiki  \n15:54\u00a0<mflorea[m]>\u00a0that's different, that controls where to search, not what gets indexed  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0there is no configuration for the indexer  \n15:55\u00a0<mflorea[m]>\u00a0yes, everything is indexed  \n15:55\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0hmm indeed... \u00a0that's missing  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0everything is indexed  \n15:55\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0would be nice to have a config for that  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0the best would be to simply archive curriki wiki, it's not accessible anymore anyway  \n15:56\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0yes but it's ,not the only wiki  \n15:56\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0we don't want indexed  \n15:56\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0for ex playgroundtemplate shouldn't either  \n15:59\u00a0<keks[m]>\u00a0pbondoerffer, tmortagne (@tmortagne:matrix.xwiki.com): `git clone --depth=1`  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0keks: this has no effect on the history  \n15:59\u00a0<keks[m]>\u00a0it doesn't clone it, right?  \n16:00\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0created https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14250  \n16:00\u00a0<keks[m]>\u00a0I thought you were talking about not fetching the history on clone, sorry :)  \n16:00\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0not really I don't remember what it does exactly but I already looked at it some time ago  \n16:01\u00a0<keks[m]>\u00a0\"Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits.\"  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0it's possible the issue was that you could not really push after that or something like this  \n16:02\u00a0<keks[m]>\u00a0true  \n16:03\u00a0<keks[m]>\u00a0but if you only want to build, this is great. i mean, if you want to work on the code, you will also want the history imho  \n16:03\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0the point here was to contribute something to a github fork  \n16:04\u00a0<keks[m]>\u00a0ohhh i see  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0pbondoerffer did not want to have to clone the whole platform just for this  \n16:04\u00a0<keks[m]>\u00a0yeah in that case i figure it's not possible  \n16:06\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0it's possible with some filter branch but not very convenient  \n16:20\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:56\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0mflorea: when you have some time I'd like to have your opinion on https://gist.github.com/vmassol/c210207f36d948bbf24e2994ba220d8f  \n17:06\u00a0<mflorea[m]>\u00a0vmassol: I commented  \n17:14\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0thanks, I commented back  \n17:29\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:31\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n20:07\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:46\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:46\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:37\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
