That UserType would do the trimming.  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu, wdyt?  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(actually only for free form content fields obviously)  \n10:42\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I find this nicer than having to do the trimming in the business code, since this is a storage concern  \n10:54\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:56\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't seem to work, it's too late in the process apparently  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n12:11\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:15\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:36\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: WDYM? Hibernate custom type that always trims the content, so that we don't get database exceptions about too large values?  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: yes  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in the end I didn't do it  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tested it though  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but for some reason I haven't fathomed my trim happened too late in the process  \n13:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0dbcp called hsqldb which raised the data truncation error before the hibernate custom type could do the trim  \n13:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway this is something we'll need to revisit in the future  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because there are lots of verifications we don't do  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to have a common agreement/decision on how we want to treat those  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in my commit earlier on I added the check in XWikiHibenrateStore  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the comment column)  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I also didn't research how to get the mapping max col length from inside the custom user type class)  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I frogot to update the other hbm files\u2026  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing it now  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: what I meant, is that we need to be careful about closing issues quickly without trying to resolve them  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0In this case I wasn't sure he had done everything we could  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we did'nt ask much to the user to try to understand the problem  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from a user POV, it's like saying \"I don't care about your problem. It works for me, so go away...\"  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0This is ok for old issues, especially if the user hasn't answered our questions but here it's relatively recent and he is answering so far...  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you agree?  \n14:09\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: I don't know what to say. if you want I can reopen the issue, but I still think it has something to do with the user's PC configuration  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: then why don't we understand it?  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what question did you ask to narrow the problem?  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki is supposed to work everywhere and if it doesn't then we need to document that  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0apparently the guy can reproduce every time right?  \n14:10\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0Sorin asked the user to test on 5.0 m1 and he could still reproduce it  \n14:10\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0yes  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's not intermittent  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0did we ask what user he used?  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0admin vs other  \n14:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0we could ask him to try it again on 5.1 with the same Java version I have  \n14:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0no, we didn't  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0retrying is not going to help  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we didn't change anything for months/years on the installer  \n14:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0yes, that's right  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(retrying with a newer version that is)  \n14:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0and the installer always worked for me and never worked for him  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all I'm saying is that the issue still exists IMO  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if he has it  \n14:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0that's why I think it's not really an issue with the installer  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then others have it too  \n14:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok. do you want me to reopen it ?  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your choice, just make sure the user is a happy user  \n14:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0:)  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it blocking him?  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has he foudn a workaound?  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0etc  \n14:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok I'll try to contact him  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we cannot close an issue at his face like this  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just ask him in comments  \n14:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0yeah that's what I thought to do too  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n14:14\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0np  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0its important  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've created issues for other projects (a lot)  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when committers close my issues  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this manner  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm telling myself that the project is badly managed and i don't want to continue on this project  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they don't care about their users  \n14:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I can understand how this can be upsetting for him  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n14:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'll reopen it and try to talk to him  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it's not if he has a workaound (ilke using the zip)  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we need to make sure of that  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't have to reopen but at least make sure he's happy  \n14:15\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n14:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok :) closed it shall remain  \n14:21\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n14:25\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:53\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n20:06\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:13\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0sdumitriu: Hello, I was wondering if I could bother you with a few more questions today.  \n20:26\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0I am trying to find the source code, so that I can have a local copy to work with. But I am having trouble figuring out which repositories I should be working with.  \n20:30\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi szrrizvi  \n20:30\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0Hello sdumitriu  \n20:31\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, it depends on what you're trying to do  \n20:31\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SourceRepository says what each repository is for  \n20:32\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0I am trying to get a very generic version of XWiki, so that I can play around with the back end source code and see how it works.  \n20:32\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-security/xwiki-platform-security-api is where the access rights APIs are defined  \n20:33\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0From what I understand, I would need the Platform and Enterprise repositories. Does that sound correct?  \n20:33\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n20:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0You probably don't have to change the rendering engine, so you don't need xwiki-rendering  \n20:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And xwiki-commons is also mostly stable code that users rarely need to change  \n20:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So yes, you'll make changes in xwiki-platform  \n20:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Build that one, then build xwiki-enterprise to get a working wiki  \n20:35\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0OK, thank you. Earlier, I was trying to browse the repository, but I was only finding XML files.  \n20:53\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0has quit  \n21:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:02\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:04\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:42\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n21:48\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:52\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has quit  \n22:33\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:53\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
