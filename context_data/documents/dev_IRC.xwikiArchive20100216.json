I initially created it (by accident) as a space. So it was a WebHome... but I went to move it into a space I had created to store such documents.. It moved fine, but in it's new location it still has it's old name... When I rename it, or look in the space's document index it appears to have the name I renamed it to, but when i View the page, it has the ol  \nLord\\_Devi - (01:01): old name listed at the very top of the wiki entry... And it is not visible in the source... so I'm not sure what is going on here.. Can someone enlighten me?  \nsdumitriu - (01:01): That is the title of the document  \nsdumitriu - (01:02): When you edit the document, don't you see a Title field on top of the content?  \nhcross left at 01:03 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nLord\\_Devi - (01:03): Ah yes =) You're right I found it!  \nLord\\_Devi - (01:03): Thanks sdu  \nhcross joined #xwiki at 01:23  \nhcross left at 01:52 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nhcross joined #xwiki at 01:56  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:29): Trying to add some wiki links to a panel i made by putting the space's webhome link in the panel as such \"[[TEC+Wiki.WebHome]]\" but when saved the link gives the url \"http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/edit/TEC+Wiki/WebHome?parent=xwiki:Panels.Tec+Wiki\" which is not what I want! If I change the [[TEC+Wiki.WebHome]] To read [[Main.WebHome]] it displays a working example url..  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:29): http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ which is more like what I want for my TEC+Wiki.WebHome page.. What am I missing/doing wrong here?  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:31): [[Tec+Wiki.WebHome]] expected URL http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/TEC+Wiki/  \nsdumitriu - (02:38): Does the Tec+Wiki space exist?  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:39): Yes I've created it  \nsdumitriu - (02:40): If the generated URL contains +, then something is wrong  \nsdumitriu - (02:40): + in a URL is the same as a space  \nsdumitriu - (02:40): + is the encoding of a space in URLs  \nsdumitriu - (02:40): So it actually links to [[Tec Wiki.WebHome]]  \nsdumitriu - (02:40): Which doesn't exist  \nsdumitriu - (02:42): But normally it should link to something like this: http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Tec%2BWiki/WebHome  \nsdumitriu - (02:42): Are you sure the URL contains + and not %2B?  \nsdumitriu - (02:42): Don't look in the status bar, open that link  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:42): Yeah ok  \nsdumitriu - (02:43): The status bar decodes URL escapes  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:43): well in my url at the top in firefox it says TEC+WIki... hehe... which I think that is showing me what it is... Kind of looks like a typo to me.. Should be Wiki not WIki...  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:44): \\*tries to fix and see if that is it...\\*  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:47): Hrm, nope that wasn't it =/  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:48): Yeah I haven't seen any %20's in my urls or anything sdu  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:48): Just TEC+Wiki..  \nsdumitriu - (02:49): Weird, could be a bug  \nsdumitriu - (02:49): THough it works for me  \nsdumitriu - (02:49): Well, a quick tip would be to not use + in the space name  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:49): You mean when referencing it with [[]]?  \nsdumitriu - (02:50): No, I mean at all  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:50): Oh! Well I was only using it because xwiki seemed to be!  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:50): How should I treat spaces then?  \nsdumitriu - (02:51): Hm, what is your space called? \"Tec Wiki\" or \"Tec+Wiki\"? The one that you created  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:52): \"TEC Wiki\" (without quotes)  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:52): the + only appears in the url when i go to it... which is why i was using that to refer to it  \nsdumitriu - (02:52): Oh, then just use space in the link  \nsdumitriu - (02:53): [[Tec Wiki.WebHome]]  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:53): Oh  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:54): grrrr, lol that did the trick for me  \nLord\\_Devi - (02:54): something that simple. ok well awesome.
