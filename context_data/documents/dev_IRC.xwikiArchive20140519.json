I would bet more on vmassol refactoring about temporary images  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(which also happen to be the last real commit before the macro start to fail)  \n11:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0from the CI it seems indeed that vmassol broke the build, but I don't see how it's commit can affect the chart macro  \n11:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0he changed the formula macro and the PDF export  \n11:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Can't find descriptor for the component [role = [interface org.xwiki.velocity.VelocityManager] hint = [default]]  \n11:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and Failed to lookup component [org.xwiki.rendering.internal.transformation.XWikiRenderingContext]  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right, I tough he committed his refactoring of temporary image in this commit  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: I see \"Can't find descriptor for the component [role = [interface org.xwiki.velocity.VelocityManager] hint = [default]]\" in oldore test since forever and I don't see how my commit could have any effect on that  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Failed to lookup component [org.xwiki.rendering.internal.transformation.XWikiRenderingContext] probably more but that's weird  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it is in the component.txt  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lets see what is special about that macro  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since if it was not registered probably it would crash pretty much everything  \n11:10\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm that's because the macro does not have olcore as dependency I think  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like oldcore is the only implementation of VelocityManager  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure if we can sure if we can safely see xwiki-platform-rendering-xwiki as always with oldcore of it I should always test if there is an available VelocityManager  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like this macro is the only one with a dependency on xwiki-platform-rendering-xwiki without oldcore  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that dependency come from display-api  \n13:03\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:20\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Hello, I'm struggling a bit with my own ColorTheme. If I have something in the {{code}} snippet. It is shown with a double dotted line. you can see it here \u00a0http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=26d987-1400497338.png \u00a0I don't know where to edit it as normal on the default theme.  \n13:25\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Ok I just see that it is on all Themes but with the other colors it doesn't point out so much. But if I want to change it generally - where could I do it  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0kaisen: I don't get any image on http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=26d987-1400497338.png  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh I do  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought it was advertising ;)  \n13:28\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Yes is small and not highlighted  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what you're after is simply some CSS change  \n13:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which can be done with either a custom skin or better simply a skinextesion  \n13:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/SkinExtensionsTutorial  \n13:30\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Thanks thats what I'm looking for :-)  \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(specifically http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/SkinExtensionsTutorial#HMinimalStyleSheeteXtension )  \n13:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu, Denis, evalica, tmortagne, vmassol, gdelhumeau: do you have any work uncommitted that is planned for 6.1M1? The release is planned for today.  \n13:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: nope, it's fine on my side  \n13:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0mflorea: nope, ty  \n13:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I'll move XWIKI-9930 to M2 then  \n13:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed, thanks, especially as I'm not active on it right now  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks for the reminder, I had forgotten about it :)  \n13:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne has two issues in progress, but there are no commits so I guess they can be moved to M2.  \n13:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0guys, please don't commit on master in the following hours (unless it's really critical). I'd like to start the release after the CI rebuilds everything.  \n13:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mflorea: I totally butchered your wysiwyg :D \u00a0http://realtime.webviewers.org/  \n13:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0cjd: why do you say so? it looks ok :)  \n13:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm doing innerHTML transformations under GWT's nose  \n13:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0with a 700 line html patcher  \n13:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok :)  \n13:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I kind of amazed myself that it worked as well as it did, I just need to change from transforming on the <body> to doing it over the whole <html> and then it will pull in the css and script when a macro is added  \n13:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0seem impressive. now, I hope this code won't be thrown away when/if we choose to integrate another WYSIWYG editor..  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or that it doesn't require too much maintenance)  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/or/and  \n13:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mflorea: no, it does html patching under the hood so it actually doesn't touch the wysiwyg API really at all :)  \n13:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0good  \n13:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: who me? :D  \n13:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: the dashboard for 6.1 has some problems and I don't have edit right on it, http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12290 can you fix it?  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by maintenance I mean: various browser support and lots of \"ifs\" to handle all browser quirks :)  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: checking  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0permission issue?  \n13:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yes indeed, I'm a bit amazed that it works in safari and FF because I did no testing but it seems fairly reliable  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forgot to share  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: should be better now  \n13:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep, thanks  \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: I removed the fix for  \n14:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks  \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have tons on things in my TODO list but nothing that would block M1 :)  \n14:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok :)  \n14:31\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: it's ok for me, you can release  \n14:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0gdelhumeau: thanks  \n14:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: I need a jira for the realtime core engine (ChainPad) can I just go ahead and register RTCHAINPAD ?  \n14:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's already in the xwiki-contrib repo as chainpad  \n14:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0(the question is do I have to go back to the list and propose the name RTCHAINPAD before setting it up)  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: you really need totaly different projects and repositories for all those realtimes projects ?  \n14:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0they don't depend on eachother so lumping them together only makes sense to reduce JIRA overhead  \n14:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0there are valid reasons to want one component and not any other  \n14:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: packager-plugin integration tests are failing (you can reproduce locally with -Pintegration-tests) with:  \n14:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.xwiki.component.internal.ContextComponentManager cannot be cast to org.xwiki.component.embed.EmbeddableComponentManager  \n14:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0does it sound familiar?  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: sure, just follow the steps that are documented now :)  \n14:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok thanks  \n14:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm getting fairly good at those steps  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: that's what I asked cjd  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's too hassle to create separate repos/jiras  \n14:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0re seperate JIRA projects or same... I didn't originally think of same because they're in seperate git repositories, they're installed seperately via the EM  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: several repos means several versions which means a compatibiltiy matrix  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and more work for releases  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's really a pain  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better release modules all together even if some have not changed  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO  \n14:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't see why it's not ok to have one jira for multiple projects now that I think of it..  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: same thing as repos  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's one jira project per release  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(because of the versions)  \n14:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm, this is what we had way back before we started releasing platform as a single unit  \n14:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0now I remember  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: if/when they are release are they going to be release together ?  \n14:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if they are release together with the same version IMO that's the only real thing that matters here  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: yes we had lots of modules and that was a pain for releases, which is why we moved to a single release  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(except for contrib projects)  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we're thinking about changing that a bit (see the xwiki-extensions email thread) but honestly I'm still worried a bit by the extra work  \n14:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I had imagined that there would be many releases to the RTWYSIWYG module and only few to the RTBACKEND  \n14:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but I need to add a new message type to ping the server so that requires re-releasing RTBACKEND  \n14:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'll try to keep going this route and if it does become a pain, I'll consider unifying them, although I'd rather not because smaller libraries have some advantages  \n14:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0(if that makes sense)  \n14:56\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hi, which event is called when comment is added?

As soon as I add a $theme variable the line is \"ignored\"  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to try it out locally, what variable are you using for example?  \n15:38\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0$theme.backgroundSecondaryColor; and $theme.borderColor;  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:38\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0but I can also put it on the mailing list so you don't need to wast your time  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you cached it  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and didn't refresh your cache  \n15:40\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0cache is set to default - so should i delete the browser cache?  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0kaisen: found it  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Color+Theme+Application#HUsingColorThemesvariables  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically the $theme var is not defined in the velocity ocntext by default, you need to import the definition  \n15:47\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Yes adding #template('colorThemeInit.vm') and activate parse works ! :-)  \n16:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:14\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: updating the page on extensions.xwiki.org would be easier if you publish the extension on maven.xwiki.org  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be a click away :)  \n18:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think I sunk a good week into maven.xwiki.org trying to make a release happen and eventually I gave up  \n18:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well.. more like a day but it was an incredibly frustrating day :)  \n18:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://contrib.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome#HReleasetheproject should do it  \n18:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but in general, big +1 for easier releasing  \n18:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or looking at any other contrib extension  \n18:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0maybe too brittle but one can dream  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do that\u2026. it's called CI :)  \n18:36\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://realtime.webviewers.org/  \n18:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0lag now displayed in the demo  \n18:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:58\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:14\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:49\u00a0<Danilo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:49\u00a0<Danilo\\_>\u00a0Hello  \n20:52\u00a0<Danilo\\_>\u00a0People, I am planning to develop an extension that will,link and show the documents of a specific wiki.
