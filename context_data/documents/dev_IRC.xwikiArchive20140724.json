Is XWiki a good choice for me if I don't have a lot of external support or will it be too complex for me to handle?  \n15:37\u00a0<knod>\u00a0yosra?  \n16:17\u00a0<knod>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<Lyes2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:49\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<Lyes2>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<joel2>\u00a0Magic 8-ball answers: \"You may rely on it\"  \n18:52\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:25\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n20:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:59\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:00\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0can anyone help me with a velocity question  \n21:01\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0I\u2019m trying to get the value from a dropdown and use it to set values of a second dropdown  \n21:20\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0sdumitriu: got any insight on this?  \n21:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0mbloom: Are those HTML dropdowns?  \n21:21\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0yes they are  \n21:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0On the same page?  \n21:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't fully understand what you're trying to do  \n21:22\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0sdumitriu: Yes, what I\u2019m trying to do is have one drop down to select a space, and then another to select a page from the space that was selected  \n21:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0OK  \n21:23\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, you can't do it in a simple way, since the HTML lives in the browser, while Velocity is executed on the server  \n21:23\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Two options  \n21:23\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a01. Split it into steps: step 1, select the page, submit, then generate step 2 with Velocity  \n21:24\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a02. Do it with JavaScript, either put all lists of pages for each space somewhere hidden in the HTML, or use an AJAX request to fetch the list of pages from the server  \n21:24\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Which one sounds better?  \n21:25\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0The second using AJAX sounds like the best solution  \n21:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0http://stackoverflow.com/q/18328871/620249  \n21:28\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The link doesn't point to the right line anymore, but that file has the answer  \n21:29\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0sdumitriu: awesome! thank you for the help  \n22:01\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:01\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n23:21\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0has quit\n"}
