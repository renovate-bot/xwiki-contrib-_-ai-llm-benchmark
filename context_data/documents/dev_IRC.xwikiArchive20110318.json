We probably need some kind of \"xwiki flavor\" configuration. flavor 1: use XE internally, flavor 2: use XE in an open site  \n09:42\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0It would be easy except for the fact that it is a farm.  \n09:53\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Going to be adventrous and see if I can start jetty from the test initializer. It would be awesome to be able to test apis in a running wiki.  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what we do in all func tests  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(start xwikii from the junit test)  \n09:54\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0But in the same process  \n09:54\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0So I can directly call apis.  \n10:00\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:07\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-6135  \n10:31\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0thanks!  \n10:40\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:41\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0hello all.

Can you help me?  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0kwoot: might depend on the XE version you're using.

Barring that all I can think is to stop dropping permissions which you do at your risk.  \n11:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes mean that there is already a core extension in 3.0-SNAPSHOT and that will be used instead of the needed 2.2.5  \n11:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0extension manager takes dependencies version as \"version and more\" for now  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works well so far, very cool! :)  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's going to kick ass with a nice UI  \n11:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hope so  \n11:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0:)  \n11:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0wait that jvelociter start working on extension manager ;)  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me rephrase that  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's going to kick ass with a nice UI and the list of available extensions listed  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you do that already? (list all avail extensions)  \n11:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea and a repository cache too  \n11:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0to search extensions etc...  \n11:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's not easy currently  \n11:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0with pure maven/aether it's not really possible I think (without nexus index)  \n11:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but i will find something don't worry  \n11:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but there some design work to support it properly with good speed  \n11:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. a local database with all repositories, apt-get style  \n11:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha yes forgot the screenshot thanks  \n11:32\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0Hi all. Is there a technique to \"pass\" some parameters to an included JSX?  \n11:33\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you have virtual=1 ?  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n11:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then you are not using the last trunk or i forgot to commit something  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I svn upped 1 hour ago  \n11:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since i see you have Extension wiki in your screenshot  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and rebuilt the whole thing  \n11:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok lets check  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: what is \"Guessed third party core extensions\" ?  \n11:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: usually that's core jar i found in the classpath for which i'm not 100% sure about the version because there was no proper pom.xml provided  \n11:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's the \"ok lest try to guess what we have already\" section  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so how do you guess the version?  \n11:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0some jingling with jar name and others core extension dependencies versions  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I see a pom here: http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/codehaus/groovy/groovy-all/1.7.7/  \n11:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0let me find you the core  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but groovy-all appears in the guessed section  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's core extensions  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when i say no pom i mean in the jar file  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh ok  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so all artifacts not built by maven  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at least)  \n11:40\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all not installed by extension manager  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/at least/at most/  \n11:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0basically everything that is in the classpath  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see the xwiki jars are not in the guessed section and there are quite a few not in the guess section either  \n11:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0most of them comes from maven repository soemwhere but we can know than only if they contains a pom.xml  \n11:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i was suprised too, was expecting a worst result  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i mean you said \"all not installed by extension manager\", those were not istalled by the ext manager  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to understand  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why xwiki would be in guess section ?  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not guessed since they provide a proper pom.xml  \n11:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all of them  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that's what i understood initially  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you said \"all not installed by extension manager\" and that confused me  \n11:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0plus i separated xwiki from the rest in the xwiki section  \n11:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not  \n11:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0did you installed the rendering with extension manager ?  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't install groovy-all either  \n11:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes that's what i'm saying...  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I think I understand  \n11:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0core extension are extension not installed by extension manager  \n11:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all of them  \n11:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki one included  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to try an upgrade now  \n11:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then in core extension you have xwiki extension, extension which provide proper pom.xml and some gray area for others  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we wanted we could do on the remote repo to check their pom.xml I guess  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/do/go/  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(could be improvement for later)  \n11:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes but for now i did not want to make core repository depends on some specific repository that is supposed to be an extension  \n11:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i think the best is to build the list at build time  \n11:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's the only safe way  \n11:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since there is jar in there for which i don't even have any idea what is the groupid  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can find that from the xwiki jars poms  \n11:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i don't have them  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0transitive resolving  \n11:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0of what ?  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have the xwiki jar poms since the poms are in the jars  \n11:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i don't have XE pom.xml for example  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n11:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0same for any war project  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have the war apparently  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see it listed  \n11:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and there is a lot of things directly in web-standard  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it's noather one  \n11:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which war ?  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's noather one  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not the standard one  \n11:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you have a war in the classpath ?  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that looks strange  \n11:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's weird  \n11:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0using tomcat ?

 \n11:56\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0jvelociter: both are fine, the JS is interpreted so I can rewrite velocity to JS  \n11:56\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0always-used JSX or on demand ?  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: \"watchlist test email notifier\" is to send the mail immediatly?
