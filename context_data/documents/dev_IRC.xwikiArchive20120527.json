I need to save the history of login attempts.Please suggest the best option. 1)Save it in SQLite db. 2)save it in a XML file (we already have simple-xml lib in the xdroid platform). Also I need to keep track of unique login user name pwd combinations so that I can suggest them in the login UI component.I think of using a seperate xml file  \n13:27\u00a0<sasinda>\u00a0for unique login combinations with encrypted password in them. Not a pwd hash).  \n13:29\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0hmm. It might take a while.. I'll do that. Thanks sergiu  \n13:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi sasinda, I'm not sure which is better  \n13:30\u00a0<sasinda>\u00a0thanks sdumitriu.
