Not natively  \nlwilke - (22/06/2008 18:35): jvelociter: hm, thanks. I see xwiki supports plugins, Would it be feasable to implement this via the plugin interface?  \njvelociter - (22/06/2008 18:39): lwilke: I'm not 100% sure, but I think it could be doable via plugin only. You can be notified of document saves, so that would be the moment you encrypt. For decrypt, you want to do it at page view time, it might be done from the plugin, too.   \njvelociter - (22/06/2008 18:41): lwilke: another solution would be to decorate our hibernate store with the encryption mecanism  \njvelociter - (22/06/2008 18:42): since the store is configurable from xwiki.cfg, you would not need to have a custom build  \nlwilke - (22/06/2008 18:51): jvelociter: that sounds interesting. I will have a look at the hibernate.cfg.xml then  \nlwilke - (22/06/2008 23:10): Uhm, can anyone help me please. I fail to get rid of this error   \nlwilke - (22/06/2008 23:10): Caused by: java.io.EOFException: Can not read response from server.
