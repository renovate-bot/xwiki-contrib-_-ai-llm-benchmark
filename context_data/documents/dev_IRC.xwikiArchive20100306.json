Hm, lets check  \nsdumitriu - (02:01): No, no context parameter  \nsdumitriu - (02:01): (I was confusing with the include macro)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:02): I had been thinking maybe xwiki.api.Api.switchSecurityContext \u00a0(that's a weird name, but that's the idea)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:03): or api.XWiki.switchSecurityContext since it isn't needed for doc and xcontext  \nsdumitriu - (02:03): But we must take care of the following two scenarios (document A includes document B as a sheet):  \nsdumitriu - (02:03): - A is privileged, B is not, B switches context  \nsdumitriu - (02:03): - B is privileged, A is not, A switches context  \nsdumitriu - (02:03): Who is the author?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:04): The author must be the author of the included document otherwise rights leak.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:10): - A is privileged, B is not, B switches context \u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0\u00a0B switches to context of B's author, or to context of current viewer.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:14): - B is privileged, A is not, A switches context \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0\u00a0option 1. B is executed in the context of B's author (which might break the script) \u00a0option 2. context switches back to viewer so that B is executed as it expects to be.  \njfx joined #xwiki at 02:29  \njfx - (02:31): I just posted a patch, but did not adjust indentation for an else-wrap trough all the old code.  \njfx - (02:31): Is that important?  \njfx - (02:33): I dont feel it offers any improvement in readability, when the indentation would just shift code two spaces right trough more than a page of code.  \nsdumitriu - (02:34): jfx: For XWIKI-4928, or which one?  \njfx - (02:34): Hm... maybe I fail. Is there something similar to php die() in velocity?  \nsdumitriu - (02:34): #stop  \njfx - (02:35): Yes, that's the one.  \njfx - (02:35): oh, gonna fix that then.  \njfx - (02:36): #if !hasprogramming (then show warning) then #stop.  \njfx - (02:36): shoud be better than wrap the rest in #else  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:37): Does #stop stop endpage.vm from parsing?  \nsdumitriu - (02:37): CalebJamesDeLisl: In 1.0 yes, but in 2.0 I think it just stops the current {{velo}} macro  \nsdumitriu - (02:37): I'll have to test  \nsdumitriu - (02:38): Hm, actually it stops everything  \nsdumitriu - (02:38): That's a bit wrong  \njfx - (02:39): Hm, so it's a no-go for #stop atm?  \nsdumitriu - (02:39): Indeed  \nsdumitriu - (02:39): I only use it when right before it is a $response.sendRedirect  \njfx - (02:40): Allright, that means I'm off the hook for tonight. :)  \njfx - (02:40): Thanks \\*\\_^  \nsdumitriu - (02:40): jfx: If it's a big portion of code on an #else branch, it's not mandatory to indent it  \njfx - (02:41): Great to hear  \nsdumitriu - (02:42): jfx: A few commens on the patch  \njfx - (02:42): sure  \nsdumitriu - (02:42): Try not to introduce blank lines, since they end up as paragraphs  \nsdumitriu - (02:42): For example here:  \nsdumitriu - (02:42): -#if(!$xwiki.hasProgrammingRights()) - \u00a0{{warning}}This document requires programming rights and needs to be saved by an administrator of this Wiki{{/warning}} -#end +  \nsdumitriu - (02:44): Second, I don't remember what XWikiTeam is supposed to accomplish, but I think it's required  \nsdumitriu - (02:44): The rest of the changes are good  \njfx - (02:45): XWikiTeam was not required when I tested. And isnt it strange to have a page owned by a non-existen user?  \nsdumitriu - (02:45): XPANELS-121 looks good  \njfx - (02:45): In fact, it'll break since it does not have programming rights.  \njfx - (02:46): Ah, xwikibot. You are teh bug. (clicked it)  \nsdumitriu - (02:46): I think that it's supposed to be automatically transformed into \"superadmin\", which always has programming rights, but I'm not sure (jvelociter did this, he'll be able to confirm tomorrow)  \nsdumitriu - (02:47): Jira is wrong, the xmlrpc connection seems broken  \njfx - (02:47): sdumitriu: I'm fixing the extra lines in the meantime, should I upload it or wait for his comment?  \nsdumitriu - (02:47): You can upload it  \njfx - (02:50): I need to learn velocity, I think.  \njfx - (02:50): I can get rid of other blank lines too, but I've no idea if they are justified.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:51): I like adding space to my code so I just comment it all out.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:51): ##  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:51): like that.  \nsdumitriu - (02:52): Huh? Actually I can't find any other document where XWikiTeam is used  \nsdumitriu - (02:52): Did I dream that it's supposed to be used/  \nsdumitriu - (02:52): ?  \nsdumitriu - (02:53): OK, I'll just apply it when it's ready  \nsdumitriu - (02:55): CalebJamesDeLisl: Still having trouble with Hudson?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:56): I think my tests are just weak.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:56): on a pentium4 everything has plenty of time to load :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:15): sdumitriu: do you use gedit? (I have a nice velocity code highlight file.)  \nsdumitriu - (03:15): Kate  \nsdumitriu - (03:15): (KDE user)  \njfx - (03:17): Okay, done. Got rid of two more blank lines, and it does not seem to break anything.  \njfx - (03:18): but I can't really tell. {{info}}$msg.get('xe.index.trash.documents.empty'){{/info}} does not display anything even when I get zero hits.  \njfx - (03:22): eh, I'll just leave them. Might be intentional  \njfx - (03:23): \u00a0#if($deletedAttachments == 0)  \njfx - (03:23): \u00a0\u00a0  \njfx - (03:23): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{info}}$msg.get('xe.index.trash.attachments.empty'){{/info}}  \njfx - (03:23): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \njfx - (03:23): \u00a0\u00a0#else  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:25): sdumitriu: You know that getXMLEncoded() converts single quotes into parentheses right? \u00a0see: XWIKI-4972  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:26): $escapetool.html() does not though.  \nsdumitriu - (03:26): You mean apostrophes?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:26): Yes that one...  \nsdumitriu - (03:27): Yeah, don't know exactly why  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:27): apache CharacterFilter bug/feature  \nsdumitriu - (03:28): jfx: The blank lines around {{info}} are needed  \njfx - (03:29): I suspected. It's reverted.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:30): Another thing, I also have a greasemonkey script for running google prittifier which I hacked to be able to highlight raw source from svn, so when I'm reading CharacterFilter.java, it's highlighted.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:31): (couldn't find any decent syntax highlighting firefox addon.)  \nsdumitriu - (03:31): Cool!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:33): I'll send a copy, the hack is pretty neat, it reads the pre element which firefox forces the document into and with a document.write() it puts it back with class=prettyprint then lets prittifier do it's job.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:34): Must execute on page load event, It can't execute too early or too late (not entirely sure why)  \nsdumitriu left at 03:39 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nsamuel joined #xwiki at 04:38  \nnickless left at 06:35 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nsamuel left #xwiki at 06:56  \nbblfish left at 07:31 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 07:37  \nheadache joined #xwiki at 09:23  \nheadache - (09:23): hi  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 09:26  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 10:42  \nheadache - (10:45): how to run xwiki inside eclipse?  \nheadache - (10:46): i've read the reference which says run as <maven goal>  \nheadache - (10:46): i've checked out xwiki enterprise trunk  \nheadache - (10:49): it seems that every maven goal builds xwiki however there are no source files in folders  \nheadache - (10:50): if i would editate some sources and see what happen?  \n\\_\\_\\_Gaurav joined #xwiki at 10:54  \n\\_\\_\\_Gaurav - (10:54): Hello Folks  \n\\_\\_\\_Gaurav left #xwiki at 10:55  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 11:23  \nsdumitriu - (11:30): vmassol: What do you want to do about the proposed GSoC projects? Send a [VOTE] email or leave them as they are? It's getting pretty late  \nheadache - (11:30): someone use eclipse?  \nvmassol - (11:31): sdumitriu: do we have a mentor for each?  \nvmassol - (11:31): I don't think it's useful to have projects for which we don't have any declared mentor  \nsdumitriu - (11:31): Some people volunteered for some projects  \nvmassol - (11:32): so provided someone express desire for a project then I think this project should be allowed to be proposed  \nvmassol - (11:32): the real vote will be when we get the number of slot allocations and we have to make choices  \nvmassol - (11:32): so I'd say we should find mentors now for the propose project and make those projects avail to students (as a proposal)  \nvmassol - (11:32): wdyt?

 \nvmassol - (11:42): links under proposed projects  \nvmassol - (11:42): (in the list)  \nvmassol - (11:43): livedata macro is a small project isn't it?  \nsdumitriu - (11:43): I fixed it once, did somebody revert the document?  \nsdumitriu - (11:43): Or override my changes?  \nsdumitriu - (11:43): No, not at all  \nvmassol - (11:43): I thought we had a project for writing macros  \nvmassol - (11:43): (several of them)  \nsdumitriu - (11:43): So far both Asiri and JVelo tried to do it but didn't succeed  \nsdumitriu - (11:43): It takes too much time  \nvmassol - (11:43): not really  \nvmassol - (11:43): it's about 1 week of work  \nsdumitriu - (11:43): Yes, really  \nvmassol - (11:44): they have never started  \nsdumitriu - (11:44): Did you read the project description?  \nsdumitriu - (11:44): It's not about switching the current code to a macro  \nvmassol - (11:44): ok  \nsdumitriu - (11:44): It's about making a very flexible component  \nvmassol - (11:45): I was deceived by \"\\* Make it a 2.0 wiki macro instead of a velocity macro\"  \nvmassol - (11:45): I'll rewrite  \nvmassol - (11:47): hmm re member directory we need it sooner than later\u2026 I'd have preferred if we did this internally  \nvmassol - (11:47): sdumitriu: do we have a project for autocompletion in editors?

But can't we modify the current PDF exporter as it able to handle attachments too?  \nsdumitriu - (16:29): Currently we have export to PDF, HTML, RTF  \nsdumitriu - (16:29): It should also be possible to export to .docx and .odf  \nsdumitriu - (16:29): Nope  \nMichelleShi - (16:30): OpenOffice is very powerful to support all the document type.  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): The current PDF exporter is based on XSL-FO  \nNirmal - (16:30): ok...  \nNirmal - (16:30): Is it Apache FOP?  \nMichelleShi - (16:30): and it's supported by oo community and sun.  \nsdumitriu - (16:31): It would be a very hard job to convert .doc to XML, trasform through xslt to xsl-fo, then transform the fo to pdf  \nsdumitriu - (16:31): Yes, Apache FOP  \nsdumitriu - (16:31): MichelleShi is right, OOo is much more powerful at converting between formats  \nNirmal - (16:32): ok..  \nheadache - (16:33): the trick is to use openoffice api to create docx or odf document  \nMichelleShi - (16:39): sdumitriu, do the new calendar application be improved from the existed one http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/CalendarApplication?  \nsdumitriu - (16:39): Maybe, but it would be easier to start from scratch  \nsdumitriu - (16:39): But the code for it is a good introduction read  \nsdumitriu - (16:40): I have to go for a while  \nsdumitriu - (16:40): Bye  \nMichelleShi - (16:40): thanks. Bye  \nNirmal - (16:40): Bye!!  \nNirmal - (16:42): let me get this right!!
