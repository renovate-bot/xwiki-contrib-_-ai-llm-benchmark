Should we keep it or close it?  \n12:38\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:38\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0hello  \n12:38\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0need some quick (i assume) help in override a skin style  \n12:39\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0I'm trying to remove the left/right padding on .main, and I define on the theme css (using Advanced on the theme editor), but it's always overriden by the main skin css  \n12:40\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0any hints?  \n12:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi, I don't really know the answer  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you could try using a SSX or override the CSS in a custom skin (you just need to override the style.css)  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could also report the issue or send a mail on the list in case someone knows how to do that with the theme editor  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe someone else is going to answer here later on (it's lunch time for a lot of people atm)  \n12:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0XwikiUserRodrigo: use \"absolute;\" maybe  \n12:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the fact is the css rules applying on .main are very precise:  \n12:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0example: #body.content.panel-left-width-Small.panel-right-width-Medium .main {  \n12:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so you need to overwrite these rules  \n12:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sorry not absolute, I meant \"!important\"  \n13:01\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0!important worked just fine for this. Thank you!  \n13:02\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0not sure if this the place to ask.. but is the Jay Skin technical documentation skin planned for implementation? It would fit my purpose beautifully  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XwikiUserRodrigo: regarding http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/JaySkin  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes AFAIK evalica would like to implement it and put it on xwiki.org  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know that evalica is going to work on xwiki.org in the coming 3 months but I don't know the extent of what she's going to do and if it includes developing this skin  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: ?  \n13:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the work for xwiki.org does not include the Jay Skin. It will be another proposal with other look.  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: so you don't plan to change the xwiki.org skin (will be flamingo), just some small customizations for the look?  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you also confirm that the jay skin is not dead, just watiing to be implemented and that we're interested in having it for xwiki.org?  \n13:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the skin on xwiki.org - yes it will be flamingo with customizations. Regarding Jay it is a proposal for a documentation skin - but nothing is planned regarding xwiki.org  \n13:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k, thx  \n13:40\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:44\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0so.. if I uderstood correctly.. Jay skin will eventually become a skin extension, but no timeframe is defined at this point?  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correcdt  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*correct  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however you can already using the Navigation Panel  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0put it as a left panel  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(remove the app panel)  \n13:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0add the search panel on the left too if you wish  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i think the latest flamingo skin in XWiki 7.4 looks better for doc sites (cleaner/simpler)  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(don't know what version of xwiki you're using)  \n13:48\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a07.4. indeed.  \n13:48\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0and the skin is fine indeed, and it was one of the reasons I went with Xwiki  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we simplified it in 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4  \n13:49\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0but.. then I saw Jay.. and it looks even better :) Great work there.  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool to know :)  \n13:50\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0I'm on my first steps with Xwiki, and I come from a Foswiki past. But here at my new company everyone is more Java oriented, so that was a plus for xwiki here. And SQL backend, SOLR and REST. Nice package!  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah cool, very intersted to hear more about how xwiki fare vs foswiki. If you could send a quick review after using xwiki a bit that would help the xwiki community a lot (to learn what we could improve and see what we're doing better/worse)  \n13:59\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0that's a good idea! will do it for sure  \n14:04\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0evalica: can you share what was the font you used in Jay?  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks!  \n14:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0XwikiUserRodrigo: It's Open Sans - wait a second  \n14:20\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0XwikiUserRodrigo: yes - it's Open Sans for content + Source Code Pro for code samples  \n14:22\u00a0<XwikiUserRodrigo>\u00a0great, many thanks!  \n14:28\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:54\u00a0<Aison0>\u00a0hello, everytime I set [[label>>||anchor=\"some\\_anchor\"]] the anchor=\"..\" part is deleted after saving  \n14:54\u00a0<Aison0>\u00a0very strange  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed very strange.
