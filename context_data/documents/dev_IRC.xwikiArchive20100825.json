You would not be happy when nothing decrypted.  \nsdumitriu - (09:36): Yeah, but that's sysadmin stuff  \nsdumitriu - (09:36): You want to encrypt stuff, you must take care of the storage  \npenyaskito\\_ left at 09:36 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nsdumitriu - (09:36): Maybe we should have a key migration mechanism  \ncjdelisle - (09:37): One reason I like the way attachments are handled is because you can dump the db and load on another box and everything works.  \nsdumitriu - (09:37): Keys should be changed periodically  \ncjdelisle - (09:37): Symmetric keys?  \nsburjan - (09:37): yes well in this particular case, smtp settings should be made by the sysadmin .. and it's not a field that would change too often .. so porting it to another machine and setting it up there is sysadmin job  \nSvenDowideit left at 09:38 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \ncjdelisle - (09:38): What's the advantage of putting the key in the java keystore rather than somewhere like a config file?  \nsburjan - (09:39): yeah, I was +1 config file :P  \nsburjan - (09:39): putside of web dir ( cjdelisle don't laugh) :)  \nsburjan - (09:39): \\*outside  \ncjdelisle - (09:40): Should we give Sorin access to the super secret jira issues?  \nsdumitriu - (09:41): We could  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 09:41  \ncjdelisle - (09:41): I think the protocol is you (Sorin) ask on the list for access to the secret mailing list and the jirs issues come with that.  \nsburjan - (09:42): by list meaning dev list ?  \ncjdelisle - (09:42): Yup.  \nsburjan - (09:43): well I could, but I don;t know how can I help further with security.

Tested. The fileds are there, everything seems ok. I have only one problem with that. When using auth, the protocol requests that you provide a valid hostname. there is no visible filed in the UI, NOR in the class.  \nsburjan - (12:36): and you get something like this :  \nsburjan - (12:37): javax.mail.SendFailedException: Invalid Addresses;  \nsburjan - (12:37): \u00a0\u00a0nested exception is:  \nsburjan - (12:37): com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPAddressFailedException: 504 5.5.2 <localhost>: Helo command rejected: need fully-qualified hostname  \nsburjan - (12:38): I'm proposing to add a filed for that too, because it is required when authing with user/pass  \nsdumitriu - (12:38): No  \nsdumitriu - (12:38): It should not fail like that  \nsdumitriu - (12:38): There's no need to set a hostname  \nrstavro joined #xwiki at 12:38  \nsburjan - (12:38): I'm testing with xwiki sas mailing system  \nsburjan - (12:39): and it fails if i don't set that field  \nsburjan - (12:39): ps: this is not related to TLS/StartTLS  \nsburjan - (12:40): helo comand is plain telnet auth  \nsburjan - (12:40): and when auth-ing you need to identify yourself with a hostname  \nsdumitriu - (12:40): Yes, but it has to be a real hostname  \nsdumitriu - (12:40): It means that you must set a hostname on your computer  \nsdumitriu - (12:41): It's not something you fake in XWiki  \nsburjan - (12:41): well, you can fake  \ncjdelisle - (12:41): Whatever the outside world knows you as is what you use for a hostname.  \nsburjan - (12:41): I'm running on localhost, havent put a hostname on my OS, and faking with param : mail.smtp.localhost=mail.xwiki.com  \nsburjan - (12:41): and it works this way  \nsburjan - (12:42): and I'm guessing that if you don't set it, the default is localhost, which will always fail when authing  \nsdumitriu - (12:42): You can just set it in Additional JavaMail properties, can't you?  \nsburjan - (12:42): yes, of course  \nsburjan - (12:43): but this option should be included in the UI because it comes with the settings mandatory for auth  \nsburjan - (12:43): I mean, we have user and password , but without this field set, it will fail auth no matter what  \nsdumitriu - (12:44): No  \nsburjan - (12:44): only open-relay mailserver don't need this option afaik  \nsdumitriu - (12:44): It never failed for me or for any of the public XWiki servers  \nsburjan - (12:44): okay  \nsburjan - (12:44): you know better  \ncjdelisle - (12:44): Usually people run the mail server on the same box as the webserver so it's not used.  \nsdumitriu - (12:44): It's just that you don't have a hostname set on your system  \nsdumitriu - (12:44): Most servers do have a hostname  \nsburjan - (12:44): yeah, true  \ncjdelisle - (12:45): Nah everyone has a hostname, I'd bet his is xwikisoftware.iasi.rdsnet.ro  \nsdumitriu - (12:45): sburjan, you're the first one to report this problem  \nsburjan - (12:45): so are we sure xwiki takes the os hostname and use it in the mailing system ?  \nsburjan - (12:45): no, mine is localhost :P  \nsburjan - (12:45): sdumitriu, : it's not a problem, it was a suggestion  \ncjdelisle - (12:46): \"\\* sburjan ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) has joined #xwiki\"  \nsdumitriu - (12:46): That's the hostname for the entire Ia?i office  \nsdumitriu - (12:46): It's not the hostname of the individual computers  \nsburjan - (12:47): well yes, but running an instance on localhost, I mean xwiki sees my host as localhost, not as xwikisoftware.iasi.rdsnet.ro  \ncjdelisle - (12:47): If the mail server is outside the office then that's the one to use.  \nsdumitriu - (12:47): Although they should set up their computers to use x.i.r.ro as the network name, and an extra hostname  \nsburjan - (12:47): well... it's outside the office  \nsburjan - (12:47): I get your point  \ncjdelisle - (12:48): You have to report yourself as what the mailserver sees you as.  \nsburjan - (12:48): no. becauseI report as mail.smtp.localhost=mail.xwiki.com and I'm allowed to send  \nsburjan - (12:48): and my hostname isnt mail.xwiki.com  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 12:48  \ncjdelisle - (12:49): Sounds like something is wrong on the server then.  \nsburjan - (12:49): yeah .. that's what I guessing  \ncjdelisle - (12:50): You shouldn't be able to trick a server into thinking it's sending itself the message which you are actually sending it.  \ncjdelisle - (12:50): You probably get an interesting mail header from that trick too.  \nsburjan - (12:51): Received: from localhost (localhost.localdomain [127.0.0.1])  \nsburjan - (12:51): by borabora.xpertnet.biz (Postfix) with ESMTP id 8C637660008  \nsburjan - (12:51): from the header  \ncjdelisle - (12:51): I'd love to rent a shell from the .gov so all my emails had nsa.gov in the header :D  \nsburjan - (12:51): intresting. so the server overrides the param I put there .. it still takes localhost  \nsburjan - (12:51): :P  \nsburjan - (12:52): and it works :)  \ncjdelisle - (12:52): might be because mail.xwiki.com resolves to it's own ip which is localhost.  \nsburjan - (12:52): sdumitriu, : you're right. I read the javadoc and it seems you are right  \ncjdelisle - (12:53): Anyway it allows you to send mail without revealing your ip which is incorrect.  \nsburjan - (12:53): Defaults to InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName(). Should not normally need to be set if your JDK and your name service are configured properly.  \ncjdelisle - (12:53): Nah, if there's a nat then that doesn't work.  \ncjdelisle - (12:54): Lots of businesses use nats.  \nsburjan - (12:54): well the odd thing is that if you override with a fake, you're allowed, something localhost is not allowed to HELO, but after all, localhost is used to fill the header. funny thing  \nsburjan - (12:54): we have nat too  \nsburjan - (12:55): ok, sorry sdumitriu \u00a0for bringing this into discussion :)  \nsdumitriu - (12:55): No problem  \nsdumitriu - (12:55): You found a possible issue  \nsdumitriu - (12:55): You could document it  \nsburjan - (12:56): but I dont think this is xwiki related. maybe the mailserver \u00a0setup is odd  \nsdumitriu - (12:56): I mean, document mail.smtp.localhost  \nsburjan - (12:56): I was thinking that xwiki uses localhost for that velue without checking the actual hostname. I thought localhost was a default hardcoded var  \ncjdelisle - (12:57): There is some documentation in the InvitationApp on code.xwiki  \nsburjan - (12:57): yes, I will improve the documentation for javamail today  \nsburjan - (12:57): I was thinking adding some cutom params for the aditional javamail params .. like auth, ssl, etc  \nsburjan - (12:58): to be on the documentation site .. to ease for custom configs  \nsdumitriu - (12:58): No, I don't agree with that  \nsdumitriu - (12:58): Too many fields makes it look complicated  \nsdumitriu - (12:58): And they aren't always needed  \nsburjan - (12:58): no no.. I was saying about documentation  \nsburjan - (12:58): not the UI  \nsdumitriu - (12:58): If we have some sample configurations, that should be enough  \nsdumitriu - (12:59): Ah, in the documentation, +1  \nsburjan - (12:59): some most used customs param  \nsburjan - (12:59): in documentation  \nsburjan - (12:59): I'm done with the UI :P  \nsburjan - (13:00): and shouldn't the password for javamial stored as password field, not blank text ? (my last remark) :P  \nsdumitriu - (13:00): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (13:00): At least password with plaintext storage  \nsdumitriu - (13:01): It doesn't offer real security, but at least the field will be masked from public access  \nsburjan - (13:01): yes. should I create an issue for making that Ui filed to password instead of input field ?  \nsburjan - (13:01): \\*field  \nrstavro - (13:01): @sdumitriu : in ColorThems.WebHome, there is this line: \"= Color Themes =\" and everything else is translated by using $msg.get . Shouldn't we add 'xe.themes.title=Color Themes' into the translations document and set the ColorThemes.WebHome title as being $msg.get('xe.themes.title') ?  \nsdumitriu - (13:01): Not the UI, the property  \nsdumitriu - (13:02): rstavro: Yes  \nsburjan - (13:02): the proprety, yes  \nsdumitriu - (13:02): rstavro: Make a patch :)  \nrstavro - (13:02): ok, I'll create a Jira issue and add a patch to it  \nsburjan - (13:04): sdumitriu, : so change t hat proprety from String to Password  \ncjdelisle - (13:04): No, that doesn't work  \ncjdelisle - (13:04): database freaks out.  \nsdumitriu - (13:04): cjdelisle: Why?  \nsdumitriu - (13:05): Password and String are both stored as StringProperty  \nsburjan - (13:05): well... login form works well as password field  \nsburjan - (13:05): and there are other password fields  \ncjdelisle - (13:05): Ahh you're right. Was thinking about something else.  \ncjdelisle - (13:06): Can't set to \"hash\" though.  \nsburjan - (13:06): well... you cant store as has, at least not one way hash  \nsburjan - (13:06): \\*hash  \nsburjan - (13:06): okay.. reporting to JIRA  \ncjdelisle - (13:10): So if we were to implement \"crypt\" password, where does the key get stored? Config files can be read, java keystore can be dumped, Any place they're stored only makes an attack a little harder.  \ncjdelisle - (13:11): xwiki-crypto relies on the user to remember the password to decrypt the content.  \nsburjan - (13:11): XAADMINISTRATION-166  \nsburjan - (13:15): ok. thanks guys for the discussions  \nsburjan - (13:15): resuming my other work  \nvenkatesh left at 14:07 (Quit: Ex-Chat  \nabusenius - (14:26): re storing the keys, imo head > random generated in keystore > random generated in config > unencrypted  \nabusenius - (14:26): in any case somehow encrypted is better than nothing  \nlucaa1 joined #xwiki at 14:34  \nlucaa left at 14:35 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 14:39  \nvmassol left at 14:46 (Quit: Leaving.  \nrstavro left at 14:48 (  \ncjdelisle - (14:52): Don't know about the keystore.

Then you find you can't decrypt anything because you lost the key.  \nabusenius - (15:11): I agree it's easy to overlook  \nabusenius - (15:11): but technically it is safer than config file  \nabusenius - (15:12): and remembering is better because it will work no matter what happens with the disk  \ncjdelisle - (15:16): maybe we demand a master passwd every time the wiki starts? \u00a0\u00a0haha how long will it take for that to end up in the init script?  \ncjdelisle - (15:17): and logs :(  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 15:22  \nsburjan - (15:25): sdumitriu, : ping  \nsdumitriu - (15:26): Pong  \nsburjan - (15:28): take a look at : http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HConfiguringtheSMTPserver and tell me if you like it.

And most evil ideas also contain big mistakes.  \nabusenius - (15:35): trusted computing is itself one big mistake  \ncjdelisle - (15:35): That said, it would be nice to have \"write only\" memory to place keys in then be able to encrypt my bios.  \nabusenius - (15:35): well, buy a pc with tpm  \ncjdelisle - (15:35): I don't trust it :P  \nabusenius - (15:36): and it does not trust you :)  \ncjdelisle - (15:36): Anyway the day apple and ms stop getting rooted is still far away.  \nsburjan - (15:37): sdumitriu, : check now. Best screenshots are made on windoze machines, sorry :P  \nsdumitriu - (15:38): Hm, you shouldn't shrink the image  \nsdumitriu - (15:38): Just make the screenshot on a resized browser window  \nsburjan - (15:38): okay. executing  \ncjdelisle - (15:39): At the end of the day, people just do what they want and there isn't really any way to stop it. Ps3 is secure so noone uses it.  \ncjdelisle - (15:40): sdumitriu: Check enterprise/trunk/web/pom.xml there's a reference to flickr plugin.  \nsdumitriu - (15:41): I know, I didn't finish the move  \nsburjan - (15:42): done  \nabusenius - (15:42): noone uses ps3? people do cluster out of them  \ncjdelisle - (15:43): Not since sony took away linux.  \nsburjan - (15:43): did what ?  \nabusenius - (15:43): well, yes, now they made a big mistake  \ncjdelisle - (15:43): every firmware update, ps3 loses a feature. lol.  \nabusenius - (15:43): it was one of the reasons why it wasn't hacked yet, linux allready worked  \ncjdelisle - (15:45): I guess one of the technician's usb sticks was cloned and they're patching them to do whatever now. Not really hacked though.  \ncjdelisle - (15:45): Definitely funny.  \nabusenius - (15:48): cjdelisle: have you seen the video about how xbox and wii were hacked?  \ncjdelisle - (15:48): nah  \nabusenius - (15:48): quite old, but entertaining  \ncjdelisle - (15:49): I respect game designers. they get these horrible architectures and actually make things run fast on them.  \nabusenius - (15:49): http://chaosradio.ccc.de/22c3\\_m4v\\_559.html  \nabusenius - (15:50): and http://chaosradio.ccc.de/23c3\\_m4v\\_1606.html  \nabusenius - (15:50): the first one is just fun to watch :)  \ncjdelisle - (15:50): downloading...  \ncjdelisle - (15:51): Few years back in a weak moment I got a ps3. I used it as a headless linux server for a little while, it's sat ever since.  \ncjdelisle - (15:52): Never updated the firmware, so I just discovered that java can be run on it.  \nabusenius - (15:52): I don't remember which of the speakers is better, but one of them made fun of the ms all the time ^^  \nabusenius - (15:52): nice  \ncjdelisle - (15:53): I have yet to find a java platform which can keep me away from the reflection api. Maybe I'll learn something about how security managers \\_should\\_ be set up :)  \ncjdelisle - (15:55): Like do they keep me from loading classes? Can I override a class? Can I override a critical class? Maybe a class which has god permission with the SecurityManager?  \nsburjan\\_ joined #xwiki at 16:05  \nsburjan` left at 16:08 (Ping timeout: 255 seconds  \nsburjan\\_ is now known as sburjan` ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nKermitTheFragger left at 16:10 (Quit: Leaving  \nvmassol left at 16:11 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa1 left at 16:16 (Quit: Leaving.  \nasrfel left at 16:33 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan left at 16:45 (Quit: Ex-Chat  \nsilviar left at 16:51 (Quit: Leaving.  \nEnygma`1 joined #xwiki at 16:54  \nevalica1 joined #xwiki at 16:54  \nEnygma` left at 16:57 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nevalica left at 16:57 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nlpereira left at 17:02 (Quit: Leaving.  \nkwoot joined #xwiki at 17:05  \nkwoot - (17:06): hello.

Sorry.  \nsdumitriu - (17:15): Yes, sure  \nsdumitriu - (17:15): What version are you using?  \nsdumitriu - (17:16): 2.4 has a nice new feature, when trying to open a non-existing document, you're promted for a template to copy  \nkwoot - (17:17): currently 2.2 but upgrade to 2.4 scheduled for this friday because of template function. I am building a prince2 project management tool and if I can program the velocity macro to make a link and the link contains info on which template to use would be very nice.  \nkwoot - (17:18): I will punt in the wiki what I have now because it is simple, but works.  \nkwoot - (17:19): hm, can not add code snippet because I habe no login to the code.xwiki. alright, in the wiki then?  \ncjdelisle - (17:22): If you're just looking for a snippet you don't need to log in.  \ncjdelisle - (17:22): If you're contributing a snippet then you do but registration is easy, we don't ask for a lot of info.  \nkwoot - (17:23): okay, where can I register for code.xwiki.org?  \nsdumitriu - (17:24): On www.xwiki.org  \nkwoot - (17:24): ok  \nkwoot - (17:27): Done: http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Macros/Prince2Macro  \nkwoot - (17:27): I will try to extend it in the next few weeks.  \nkwoot - (17:27): going home now. thanks for your help.  \nkwoot left #xwiki at 17:27  \ncjdelisle - (17:28): wake up  \nsburjan` - (17:28): :))  \nsdumitriu - (17:28): !help  \njbrBridge - (17:28): !who - shows who is on the other channel  \njbrBridge - (17:28): !shutdown - shutdown bridge (will probably attempt to rejoin after a few seconds)  \ncjdelisle - (17:28): wrong bot  \nsdumitriu - (17:29): This works:  \nsdumitriu - (17:29): /msg xwikibot abc  \ncjdelisle - (17:30): !search Prince2Macro  \ncjdelisle - (17:30): !news  \nsdumitriu - (17:31): Probably the observation rule was lost  \ncjdelisle - (17:33): It'd be nice if xwikibot could be !restarted  \nabusenius - (18:02): does somebody remember what the intended purpose of xwiki-core-actions was?  \nabusenius - (18:02): was it also supposed to contain the servlet filter?  \ncjdelisle - (18:02): to replace XWikiAction.  \nabusenius - (18:03): I start having doubt if moving ActionFilter out of the core is such a good idea  \ncjdelisle - (18:04): We all want to support portlets but nobody really knows how it should be done.  \ncjdelisle - (18:04): So it's stalled.  \nabusenius - (18:05): I see  \nabusenius - (18:06): is there some kind of migration assistent that moves configuration from cfg to properties?  \nsdumitriu - (18:07): abusenius: No  \nsdumitriu - (18:07): abusenius: You should just leave ActionFilter in the core for the moment, move the other 2  \nabusenius - (18:07): yea, looks like it is stuck there forever  \nabusenius - (18:08): the rest is easy, I have already moved them locally  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 18:19  \nsburjan` - (18:22): cool  \nsburjan` - (18:22): so we'll soon drop xwiki.cfg ?  \nsdumitriu - (18:22): Not quite so soon  \nsdumitriu - (18:22): But yeah, that's a goal  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 18:26  \nsburjan` - (18:26): cool  \nsburjan` - (18:26): core needs a lot of improvement  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 18:37  \narkub left at 18:47 (Quit: Leaving  \nabusenius left at 19:02 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nlpereira joined #xwiki at 19:17  \nMartinCleaver left at 19:18 (Excess Flood  \nmflorea left at 19:19 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol left at 19:34 (Quit: Leaving.  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 19:35  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:37 (Quit: Leaving  \nlucaa left at 19:48 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \ntmortagne left at 20:02 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan` - (21:21): sdumitriu : ping  \nevalica1 left at 21:24 (Quit: Leaving.  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 22:02  \nsdumitriu - (22:04): sburjan`: Pong  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 22:05  \nsburjan` - (22:17): is your DCC working ?  \nsburjan` - (22:17): or should I skype :)  \nsdumitriu - (22:18): No DCC  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 22:27  \nevalica left at 22:31 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmflorea left at 22:59 (Quit: Leaving.  \nEnygma`1 left at 23:08 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nlpereira left at 23:20 (Quit: Leaving.  \n\n"}
