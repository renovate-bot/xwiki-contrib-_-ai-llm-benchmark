\u00a0\u00a0(I'm the owner of the subwiki)  \n14:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Maybe I can hook an extension point which is ~always called and use velocity to pull the JSX from there ?  \n14:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed JS extension right checking should probably be changed to reflect the rules applied in other places like translations, uiextensions, etc  \n14:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, I can create a jira for that but it's a pain because we still have to find a solution for developing our extension even after it's fixed because of backward compat  \n14:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12285  \n14:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:50\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, in editinline.vm there's a hidden param for xredirect and it seems it's modified from some javascript, would anyone know where this js is?
