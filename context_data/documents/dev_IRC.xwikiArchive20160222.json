 \n16:08\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I think it's 7.1 or 7.2, let me check a sec please  \n16:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it must be in menusview.vm, or in menus\\_home.vm  \n16:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: I had a failed git push on platform master due to your commit, but I`ve pushed separately from the release script (which went on to enterprise) and it should be fine  \n16:08\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a07.1.1  \n16:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0xwiki\\_finstern: it's a file on the filesystem  \n16:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0need to look at the parents  \n16:08\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0this is my version  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm the script should to a pull before the push then to be safer  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just before the push I mean  \n16:09\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0looking into this, thank you  \n16:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0damn, http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Nested+Pages+Migrator+Application/plan.png is not updated  \n16:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, probably  \n16:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0looking at the parent update commits and they seem weird indeed  \n16:11\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0we have an issue, \u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/viewattachrev/Extension/Nested+Pages+Migrator+Application/plan.png \u00a0shows 3 versions and http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Nested+Pages+Migrator+Application/plan.png is not the last one  \n16:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: \u00a0think I need to run the parent updating command we used to do in the past  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not weird it's a XSLT transformation but for some reason it did not catched the version  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and XSLT rewrite the XML and sometime \"optimize\" it  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no idea how to make it keep empty lines  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but anyway this is not an issue  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't know why it did not catched the version, will try to debug  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/4a9025c9e878cdc542a21bf7536292246f726ef0#diff-600376dffeb79835ede4a0b285078036L259 is not very nice  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a pity Maven version plugin is so unusable for something as simple as setting a parent version  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it only accept to set something that exist which is not the case for stable releases  \n16:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so the way I see it, the parent was not updated for top level projects only  \n16:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I just executed the xsltproc locally and the version is properly changed  \n16:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a copy paste of the command from the script  \n16:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: yes I'm talking about repository parent  \n16:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0release plugin is taking care of the other parents  \n16:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you still have the release log available ?  \n16:22\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see if there is a warning or something related to xsltproc  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because I really have no idea why it's not working on a1-1 and it's working well on my side  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's like $NEXT\\_SNAPSHOT\\_VERSION was wrong  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but that's what is used for everything  \n16:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0after the building was done  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so nothing in the log  \n16:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0amack2: added documentation there: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LESS+Module#HDebuggingLESSfileswithCSSSourceMaps  \n16:25\u00a0<amack2>\u00a0gdelhumeau: great!  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: the command works well on a1-1 so the only thing that can bee wrong is $NEXT\\_SNAPSHOT\\_VERSION, I don't understand  \n16:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if that was wrong, would the child artifact versions still be set ok by the release plugin?  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this variable contain the answer to \"What is the next SNAPSHOT version?\"  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: (04:24:25 PM) tmortagne: but that's what is used for everything  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yes everything should be wrong  \n16:28\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's also the variable that was used before XSLT based move  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I have no idea what happen  \n16:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0What is the next SNAPSHOT version?  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually I'm sure the variable is correct since that's what is used one line before to update commons.version and this one is right  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's something wrong somewhere in \"xsltproc -o pom.xml --stringparam parentversion \"$NEXT\\_SNAPSHOT\\_VERSION\" $PRGDIR/clirr-excludes.xslt pom.xml\"  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0${NEXT\\_SNAPSHOT\\_VERSION} is right in the following command so I guess it's not it  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the right xslt is executed as otherwise we would not have the \"cleanup\"  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it does not make any sense to me right now...  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: I found what is the issue...  \n16:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: what was it?  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0copy/paste, look at the name of the xslt file in the command I pasted  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course in when I tested I tested with the right one since it was a different path  \n16:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no wonder why https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/4a9025c9e878cdc542a21bf7536292246f726ef0#diff-600376dffeb79835ede4a0b285078036L259 looked so weird  \n16:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: it was the xslt for clirr excludes :)  \n16:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n16:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0programmer bug  \n16:59\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:59\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n17:00\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:23\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0hmmmh  \n17:23\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0when you define a class sheet  \n17:23\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0For the Static list type, is there a way to edit the text displayed ?
