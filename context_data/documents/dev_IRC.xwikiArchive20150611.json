It's any image that you attach in Xwiki then you reference it in a doc changing the width  \n10:56\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0it's always a bit annoying to have to restart XWiki for such a small thing :) I'm going to open a request ;)  \n10:57\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, my previous messages was for you too.  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a general config that is not supposed to change  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I don't see why it would be annoying  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you configure it once only  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(martinus\\_\\_)  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not usually the kind of thing you change often  \n10:59\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0but you may have to change it per wiki for example  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's different  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now this is a global setting for your xwiki instance  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure the per wiki UC is valid, you'd need to explain why you need different quality on different wikis, I don't see why  \n11:00\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0the thing is, why an admin would need access to the xwiki.cfg and permission to restart the container for such a basic thing ?  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr?  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) it's not basic  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) it's no more basic that hundreds of other config options there in xwiki.cfg  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if your point is that all config options in xwii.cfg should be able to be modified at runtime it's another matter which is valid  \n11:01\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0it's basic because if affect image quality in web pages. so it's content. And the default setting is pretty low. maybe ol-ow2 can show an example ?  \n11:01\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, of course I'm pointing this too  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the default is too low then it's yet another issue!  \n11:02\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0http://www.ow2.org/bin/view/Events2015ProgrammingContest/ right panel for example (hi vmassol)  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no magic though  \n11:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is an issue about the way the resize is implemented that could be improved a lot actually which would be the best first step IMO  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you need quality you should provide cropped images :)  \n11:03\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0http://www.ow2.org/bin/download/Panels/Topics2014ProgrammingContest/BUAAlogo.jpg original image  \n11:03\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0but the \"too low\" depending on a subjective criteria  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what would give the best  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mean, as thomas says we can improve the algoirthm  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it'll never be as good as an unresized image  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(obviously :))  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we already have a jira issue on the quality  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(btw)  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that according to the jira issue the current implementation is really really bad and using the suggested lib would probably already improve it a lot with the current quality setting  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7623  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now even with best quality you can end up with bad result  \n11:05\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I even disabled it in some wiki when people was using big images for profiles  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/when/where/  \n11:06\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0okay so it's more a bad implementation issue than any points i've raised  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I guess XWIKI-7623 is what martinus\\_\\_would like fixed  \n11:07\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0yes. And anyway , in some CMS you can for example set quality parameters for imageMagick from the UI. Which sounds proper from a webmaster point of view (or he should ask the admin, that might be overloaded which is still another issue of course)  \n11:08\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0but I guess you got my point her :)  \n11:09\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0because restarting a farm that contain 15+ websites just for can be annoying I can assure  \n11:13\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:18\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, \" it's no more basic that hundreds of other config options there in xwiki.cfg\" \u00a0do you really thing this ? \u00a0I see a difference between 'xwiki.store.migration.databases' , and 'xwiki.plugin.image.defaultQuality'. The first has no reason to be changed at runtime for ex (that's not what I call a 'basic' thing). The second could be and a webmaster could benefit without the help of the admin  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: sure, anyway any parameter that make sense at runtime is always an improvement (when to put it in the UI is another matter)  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: for me the image quality is not something to be changed at runtime but it could be  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/when/where/  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*could be argued  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0having the possibility to set it at runtime will not cause issues so it's ok to be able to do that technically, the only issue then is crowded configuration UI  \n11:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0[[Some\\_Argue]]  \n11:21\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, let's say, to prevent a container stop/start :) It's always good not to have to restart the whole engine isn't it ?  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the same could be said for the list of rendering transformations to execute for ex  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and for a lot of others)  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since wiki admins could want to enable/disabme emoticons for example  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: sure  \n11:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm surprised that browsers have not begun to inform servers via a little header that they plan to show $image with $width/$height  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was replyong to your comment saying it was a pain  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a one time pain  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is acceptable IMO  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't mean we shouldn't try to improve it ;)  \n11:22\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0yes but there might have several one-time-pain lol  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0said differently I didn't consider it a top priority compared to lots of otehr issues :)  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if you provide a patch then it's another matter! :)  \n11:24\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, absolutely I agree. It's more a general issue with configuration things that needs a restart.  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n11:25\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ol-ow2, do you need something else configured in xwiki.cfg so I can restart the container ? \\*lol\\*  \n11:25\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0joking of course  \n11:26\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0:)  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:26\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0we'll see this at next upgrade :)))  \n11:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh the age-old problem of changing config files \"to take effect on next restart\"  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is a problem because it's some old style plugin config  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we moved to component and ConfigurationSource we make sure that all config for which it makes sense can be modified at runtime  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so even if there's not always a UI they can still be configured in xwikipreferences docs  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or specific config docs)  \n11:29\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0yes. good start  \n11:31\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0about the resize implementation , https://code.google.com/p/thumbnailator/ seems to be rather \"active\"  \n11:31\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0but still \"Thumbnailator is still early in its development\"  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well looks slightly dead to me  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://code.google.com/p/thumbnailator/source/list  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for 0.x version it's not very encourging  \n11:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0what version is it ?  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a00.4.8  \n11:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I would expect a lib at that version to be more active  \n11:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0some people are very conservitive and use like 0.24.6 and so on because they don't want to say \"1.0\"  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or they should name it 1.0!  \n11:34\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0what about using java interface do imagemagick ?  \n11:34\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:34\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0s/do/to  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we just need an xwiki interface to resize  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then we can swap any impl in the future  \n11:36\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, I'm not sure if what I'm saying about IM is relevant. I only read that there is a java interface to it  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea, haven't researched  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but an interface provides the freedom to use whatever we want  \n11:36\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I add the link to the mentioned xwiki issue, we never know  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n11:39\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ol-ow2, so you read that ? do some crops and don't bother the admin anymore please :D :D  \n11:40\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0yeah great  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: does it means that every single extension that were using require.js and $services.webjars.url are broken ? from what I understand you had to put .js and not you have to remove it  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/not/now/  \n12:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, almost all extensions, see http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki71M1#HLoadingJavaScriptfromWebJarswithRequireJS  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: talking about XWIKI-10881  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think this is acceptable  \n12:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0unless the js code is evaluated, in which case you need to put the .js extension  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: this issue broke all extension that were using webjars, we need to do something better  \n12:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't see what we can do  \n12:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0maybe overwrite the require function and make it check if the .js extension is specified  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well the webjar resource try with and without the .js, it's not much  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/try/could try/  \n12:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is sure is that we can't stay like this  \n12:09\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n12:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0actually there is a 'noext' plugin for requirejs that prevents it from adding the '.js' extension  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i don't remember removing js at the end or anytihng like this  \n12:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but the default code we have in platform has been already changed to not put the extenbsion  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think Marius made some changes though  \n12:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't recall the details  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my goal for XWIKI-10881 was never to change the extension at the end  \n12:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0requirejs adds the extension if the URL is relative and doesn't have a query string. Before XWIKI-10881 the webjar URLs had a query string so requirejs did not add the extension. Now it adds it  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was just to change the url path format and using $services.url() shoul protect you normally  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I see  \n12:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0by changing the URL (move the path from query string) we changed the behaviour  \n12:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0$services.url() does not decide of the file name  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we could add a query string?  \n12:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0a fake one? yes, but it's kind of hackish  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@marius: didn'r you do some change for this?  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you or guilluame  \n12:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0would be a pity to loose the flexibility not to have the extension  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: by the way it means the ckeditor extension is now unusable in < 7.1 ?  \n12:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep, I'd like to be able to not specify the extension  \n12:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0if you use require-css for example, you need to define ressource twice  \n12:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0without extension you may share the same resource  \n12:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne, see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/CKEditor+Integration#HCompatibility  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: ok but even if it's documented it's not very nice :)  \n12:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't understand  \n12:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0there is other extension that will be broken as well  \n12:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: impossible to try last version of the extension in < 7.1 is not very nice  \n12:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0what is annoying is that it is not easy to make them compatible with both, so you need to maintain 2 version of the same extension  \n12:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes so we need to fix this regression  \n12:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but there is no easy way out  \n12:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sure, but you have an option. If you want the cutting edge you should try a more recent version of XWiki  \n12:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the mistake was to have made it bad in 6.x  \n12:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0a potential solution would be to keep the compatibility function, and to provide a new one for 7.x  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: a not yes released version of XWiki, great. It may be Ok for an experience extension like this one but making impossible to have an extension usable in both < 7.1 and 7.1 is a nonsense to me  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/yes releases/yet released/  \n12:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I think having a separate function is the cleanest solution, the other alternative being to server .js.js files  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: need to find the new method name but yes it's probably the safest  \n12:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm more in favor to check for \".js.js\" in the webjar handler  \n12:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0with a config param to disable it  \n12:22\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:22\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but with that, you will be serving .js.js files  \n12:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, is there any problem?  \n12:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0it is a bit odd for the client side  \n12:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0as I said, with the config option to disable it  \n12:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0+1 for .js.js  \n12:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I find it more ugly to have two methods to get the webjar URL  \n12:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0btw, I am not sure the behavior of the require-css will be compatible  \n12:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0require-css ? we're using that?  \n12:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0from what I see, it behave differently in regards to the presence of a query string  \n12:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0does require add the extension for css?  \n12:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am using that in an extension, couldn't I ?  \n12:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0someone wrote an extension to make requirejs work with css but it's a massive hack and it doesn't work in every browser  \n12:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0there is different implementation cjd, and there exists efficient ones  \n12:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Denis, we can serve .css.css also  \n12:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0no  \n12:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0why?  \n12:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://requirejs.org/docs/faq-advanced.html#css  \n12:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0tl;dr minefield  \n12:27\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0what I mean is that you focus on a given use case, not sure we will solve them all  \n12:27\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0in regards to css, it should works without any hack actually, since it behave properly without extension and a querystring  \n12:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm sure that .js.js will \\*not\\* solve all possible use cases, if it did then it would be a breakthrough in CS  \n12:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0my position is we need to make logical steps forward and backtrack when something doesn't work  \n12:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0what looks odd to me with .js.js is that the name will stay on client side  \n12:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0why not using a new method ?  \n12:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hrm does that break old extensions ?  \n12:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I  \n12:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'd rather not complicate the API  \n12:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you keep the existing methods with a querystring, and deprecate it  \n12:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0wdym?  \n12:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you use a new one from now on  \n12:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh, I'll use the old one so that my extensions work on older xwiki :)  \n12:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you mean modify $services.webjars.url to return a fake query string?  \n12:31\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I mean, you ensure the URL with the old method always has a querystring, and you provide a new one without that hack  \n12:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and add new method. Wouldn't the fake qs be strange too like the .js.js?  \n12:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't see how the fake qs is different from the .js.js  \n12:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0both a strange  \n12:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0both stay on the client  \n12:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I like .js.js because there are a lot of ways to screw up with requirejs and that smooths them all over  \n12:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\"do what I mean\"  \n12:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0cjd: or hide stupid usage and potential issue  \n12:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0cjd: it will work only for require+webjar  \n12:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0another option  \n12:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in the $services.webjars.url we test if the path ends with .js .

Yes -> remove .js if no extra params (=qs). No -> add .js if extra params (qs)  \n12:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0this way the API is more robust  \n12:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0actually no  \n12:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we can't remove the .js  \n12:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0because we don't know if the URL will be used with requirejs  \n12:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0adding an extra fake qs is not a problem  \n12:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0removing the extension is a problem if you don't use the URL with require  \n12:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so the solution remains:  \n12:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(13:35:07) mflorea: in the $services.webjars.url we test if the path ends with .js .

I've been playing with xwiki for a bit and have a small question. We have an xwiki system up and running with several sub-wikis, and global users. We want to have a wiki unviewable to all users unless specifically invited in. What's the proper way to go about that?  \n17:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0troubla is that global admins always see everything  \n17:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so they see that sub wiki in any case  \n17:46\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0Barring that case.  \n17:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0aside of that I thought you can lock out the global XWikiAllGroup in the subwiki ... but I have not tried  \n17:47\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0So you'd create a group specifically for viewing?  \n17:47\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the \"Invite\" might be to add the global users to the local XWikiAllGroup in the subwiki \u00a0then  \n17:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but. ah, wait, does the subwiki show up in the wiki index anyway? (I really forgot, sorry)  \n17:48\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0I think so  \n17:51\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0I'm playing around with it... To new users, I think the separations between global/local users, and rights across those users, are a little confusing.  \n17:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0hey mate  \n17:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0in User & Groups -> Rights  \n17:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0what happens if for the XWikiAllGroup you click two times on the \"View\" checkmark  \n17:53\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0then the symbol becomes a \"red\" denied, which to me would mean that anyone from that group is unable to view the content  \n17:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3: ^^  \n17:57\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0Trefex: for which scope?  \n17:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0Global i would guess  \n17:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0in that case perhaps you would need to create a new group ?  \n17:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0hang on  \n17:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0can you try to disabled view in Global scope  \n17:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0and enable view for \"Local\" scope  \n18:00\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0and add global user to xwiki etc and try  \n18:01\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0Yeah, still not able to view.  \n18:03\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0mhhhh  \n18:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0cjd: vmassol help?  \n18:06\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0Just to clarify the full configuration: \u00a0\u00a0Wiki system uses LDAP for registration.
