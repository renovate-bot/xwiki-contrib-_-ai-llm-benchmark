:)  \n11:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since some might want to avoid that technical doc  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/if/when  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys we have \u00a0aproblem on playground  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0users are not able to edit pages on the wiki  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hwoever the permissions seem ok to me  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis1: hi  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to install http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Check+Security+Cache  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seem ok: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Admin/CheckSecurityCache?ref=playground%3ASandbox.WebHome&user=playground%3AXWiki.vmatest  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm it works now  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: works now....  \n11:46\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe runing this script has indirectly flushed some stuff  \n11:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: I will test tomorrow to see if the problem persist - thank you  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: BTW we may need to hide those: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(there are 2 apps visible now)  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we hid the tour and I think we should hide those as well. In general we should hide the apps we provide and leave it empty for users to have their own apps in there and not touch the default apps  \n11:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: the apps are from Demo Content - the idea was to be visible since they are not technical, but the user should see/use them  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know they are from demo content  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0A user may not go throught he help cetner  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and may go to AWM  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you think he'll understand and delete them ?  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because if I'm installing xwiki for my need  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as a user-  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0)  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I certanly don't want to see those apps  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're only interesting for the evaluator persona  \n11:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I'll talk with mflorea and see what we can do  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can users delete them?  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thx  \n11:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0thx  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie have permissions to delete them)  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the last author should also be modified BTW  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally all apps that we bundle have the Admin user  \n11:53\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0yeap - normally - in this case I imported them as XAR (because of the version differences 8.2.1 - 8.4)  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this is even chcked by the build )  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0makes sense then  \n12:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: those apps are hidden by default, see https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-help-center/blob/master/src/main/resources/Help/Applications/Contributors/WebHome.xml but they become visible when they are edited. It just means that someone edited the apps on playground.  \n12:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(there's no UIExtension object on the app home page to put the icon on the app bar)  \n12:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I removed the UIX object explicitly for this  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Caty has imported them as XAR  \n12:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but the object is added back when you edit the app  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is thay why they're visible in the AWM LT?  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see anyone else who has edited them  \n12:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0they are AWM apps so yes, they are visible on the AWM LT. I was referring to the app bar, not to he livetable  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/AllDocs#|t=alldocs&p=1&l=15&s=doc.date&d=asc&doc.location=Help  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I was only talking about AWM LT  \n12:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0then I don't agree with you  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're only for the evaluator person  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Persona  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and they should not leak to the other persona  \n12:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0they should be visible on the AWM live table because they are demo content  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only for the eval persona  \n12:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0same as the BlogIntroduction is visible on the blog  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that too  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the blog post it's easy to delete it  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it the same for those apps? who can delete them?  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that was the question I asked above)  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically we need to make it clear to users  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- when content is demo content  \n12:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0any admin can delete them, there are no special right set on them  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- with instructions on how to remove them easily  \n12:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but they are part of the help center app  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the home page can also be considered demo content btw  \n12:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and the idea is that you remove the demo content app, not delete just some of its pages  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't fully agree with this  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I'm an admin  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to keep the help center for my users  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't want demo content to leak into the wiki  \n12:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0those app are part of the help center  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's why theys hould be contained th'ere  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not leak  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the help center is useful  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in most cases I'll expect admins to keep it  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since that's documentation  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however when you start using your wiki for real  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't want to see demo content in standard places  \n12:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0again, those apps are part of the help center, if the help center is useful then those apps are useful too  \n12:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0otherwise we wouldn't include them in the help center  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grr  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't want to understand so I'm repeart it once more  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the help center is usefu for users who want to go there and learn about it  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0those apps showing up in the AWM LT when you use your wiki for real is bad  \n12:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I understand what you're saying, I just don't agree  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then we'll need other opinion since I don't see how someone cannot agree with what I said :)  \n12:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for me it's confusing to see the app in the help center and not in the AWM live table  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems so obvioius to me  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not saying thaty  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm saying that it's ok for the eval persona but not after, when you start using your wiki for real  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when you do so you don't want tor emove the help enter  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*center  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you do want to remove the demo content that is in standard places  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the demo content that is located in the Help space is ok tough  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's contained and not showing up in standard places  \n12:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0when you're using the wiki for real you still go to the help center and you still see those apps there and so you still wonder why aren't those apps listed in the AWM live table is they are AWM apps  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not giving your the answer marius  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm telling you the problem  \n12:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and I don't agree it's a problem  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is not a problem? showing those apps even when you start using your wiki for real?  \n12:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0those apps are located in the help center space, but the AWM live table looks everywhere. I can of course hide the home page of these apps to hide them from the AWM live table but I don't agree with this  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again this would be one solution and I didn't even menton it  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you did it  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've not provided an answer!  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first I want to raise the problem and that we agree there's something to improve  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so \"showing those apps even when you start using your wiki for real is ok for you?\"?  \n12:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I mentioned it just to show you that I understand what you say but again I don't agree with you. To be clear: I don't think it's a problem that these apps appear in the AWM LT when you start using your wiki for real  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becauze if the answer is that admins should remove the help center to have those apps diappear then it's not a good solutoin  \n12:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't think admins have to remove these apps, because I don't think listing the apps in the AWM live table is a problem  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so you agree that our answer is that the admin is expected to remove those apps one by one if he doesn't want to see them but still keep the Help center?  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't believe you  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to see your own wioki  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that contains demo content mixed with real content  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can bet you'll have removed the demo content  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(knowing you)  \n12:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I need to go to lunch.  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can bet you'll have changed the home page and that you'll have remove the first blog post too  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok good lunch!  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see what others tihink too, that helps  \n13:04\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: just a new mention about the Playground. Now the Homepage is also editable.  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes this is known  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and why I've modified the permissions on playgroundtemplate  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could fix this now  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it means deleteting and recrearting playground  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus probably a crash of xwiki.org  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so first step would be to upgrade xwiki.org to 8.4.4  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I'm working on organizting this xwiki sas infra  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/this/this with  \n13:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k - thank you  \n13:17\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:44\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0hello  \n13:44\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0I tried to use the office server (libreoffice), but when I try to show a document, I get the error  \n13:45\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0Failed to execute the office macro: unsupported URL: type detection failed  \n13:45\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0it's an ubuntu server. What do I need for type detection?  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi Aison  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're trying to use http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Office+Macro right?  \n13:57\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0well, all what I did is: I enabled the office server in the settings and I using the filemanager extension.  \n13:57\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0on my testmachine it works, the exact same xwiki copy on my productive machine fails  \n13:59\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0so I don't use the office macro directly in my wiki page. I guess the file manager extension is using it to show the content of a file?!?  \n13:59\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: answered, but not very helpfully  \n14:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0thx for the answer, anyway  \n14:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0currently playing with hibernate  \n15:24\u00a0<chaas\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<chaas\\_>\u00a0is now known as <Signum>  \n16:12\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: it seems you are the release manager for 9.1  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm indeed  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking dae  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*date  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow, it's today!  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grrr I missed it  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes that's because there's only 1 week between RC and final so it's short  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so let me start to review the ci  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(dropping now what I was working on)  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes we still need to fix the bug introduced in the build by thomas  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0enteprrise has not been able to build for a week now :(  \n16:36\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing mail test... my bad  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually we're pretty good on the CI for the 9.x branch  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm going to start the maven release , please hold your commits  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys we have a problem for https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13972  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's open but has commits  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm seems it was committed on master  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also on the 9.1.x branch  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could revert it but I don't know if it'll have any consequence on other issues committed  \n17:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0github indicates it's already on 9.1-rc-1: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/19ae43ec1a31eee5af6fdf43f506e48d0be9960b  \n17:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so it is probably a leftover  \n17:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0which should have been close for 9.1-rc-1  \n17:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes 9.1-rc-1 has this commit too: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commits/xwiki-platform-9.1-rc-1/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-rest  \n17:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so IMO close it with 9.1-rc-1 as fix version  \n17:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0if you are really in doubt maybe call thomas  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good idea, I'll send him a text message  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll consider it's finished since it's not causing any breakage in the build  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll need thomas to update the RN when he's back though  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you did the 9.1RC1 release?  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a problem with the filter used for http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=13806  \n17:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0no I didnot  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not shared apparently  \n17:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I think it was Thomas  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0haha  \n17:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes it was Thomas  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it seems there was no new issue done for 9.1 compared to 9.1RC1  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03 bugs fixed whencompared to 9.1RC1: http://jira.xwiki.org/issues/?jql=category%20%3D%20%22Top%20Level%20Projects%22%20and%20resolution%20%3D%20Fixed%20and%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%229.1%22  \n17:47\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<Avar68>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<warrior>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:12\u00a0<warrior>\u00a0is this the first time xwiki is selected for gsoc ?  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grr.... 1 hour+ to get the translatios  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to find that there's no new translation....  \n19:25\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:41\u00a0<vinitjain>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:41\u00a0<vinitjain>\u00a0hey  \n19:41\u00a0<vinitjain>\u00a0has quit  \n19:47\u00a0<sumedhN>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<sumedhN>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:49\u00a0<sumedhN>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:59\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<prakhar123>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:20\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:45\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<sumedhN>\u00a0has quit  \n22:12\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n22:18\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:29\u00a0<Avar68>\u00a0has quit\n"}
