Have you changed the documenttree recently? I've noticed the following this morning in my output (just done a rebuild of xwiki-enterprise): https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/5b3777a9d50b02458704db09712b1692/raw/80e5c33330cd2ba6ea35ed42c710694a5045ace1/gistfile1.txt My question is whether I should open a jira issue or not (ie whether it was there before 8.3M2). Any idea?  \n10:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: good morning. Yes, I changed the document tree (you even reviewed the commit :) )  \n10:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0can you tell me the steps to reproduce?  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0started XWiki and edited a page and clicked on Syntax Help and navigated in the syntax  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep editing the home page generates some output  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0viewing page too actually  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(any page)  \n10:58\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0has quit  \n10:58\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n10:59\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:00\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: this should fix it  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n11:42\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:28\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n14:28\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:39\u00a0<[d\\_\\_d]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:43\u00a0<[d\\_\\_d]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Why I am redirect to \"WebHome?editor=wiki\" when I click on the \"wiki editor\" (with a more complete query string)  \n16:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it seems to be done on purpose but it makes me impossible to fix http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6929  \n16:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0apparently it redirects me using a \"POST\" method  \n16:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0which makes the parameters invisible from the location bar  \n16:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea, Enygma`, any idea?  \n16:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0gdelhumeau: that's normal, we want to preserve the content when switching between Wiki and Wysiwyg edit modes, so we do a submit (POST). You cannot really put the content in the query string  \n16:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok  \n16:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so what is missing is the need to preserve others parameters, isn't it?  \n16:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0why do you say it prevents you from preserve the URL parameters? you could put them in hidden inputs so that they are submitted with the content  \n16:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but they should have lower priority than the form field. Imagine that you have title=foo in the query string. You need to be able to \"overwrite\" it from the form. If the user changes \u00a0the title and then switches the edit mode then he should see the changed title, not \"foo\"  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:07\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n20:43\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:16\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0Hello guys, I would like to know what would you recommend me to use in order to generate references (like citations in a scientific paper) in an object of a given class. My class has a couple of textAreas in which I would like to allow end-user to cite papers/books/etc. Then in another textArea  \n21:16\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0\u00a0I would like to generate a list of those cited references.  \n21:17\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0I have tried some extensions like Citation, Annotation and Footnotes, but found some drawbacks for each one of them.  \n21:17\u00a0<barretto>\u00a01. Citation seems a good choice but forces end-user to add a citation object first, before being able to cite it.  \n21:17\u00a0<barretto>\u00a02. Annotation looks promising if we consider that for the end-user it is easy to create an annotation and fill in the reference data, but it allows multiple annotations at the same place (for example, I can add multiple annotations at the same word) and the annotations tab is now merged with the comments tab so it won't really look like a paper references section.  \n21:18\u00a0<barretto>\u00a03. Footnotes seems really interesting because we can use footnote macro with the reference and it automatically generates a reference-like content at the bottom at the textArea. The main problem is that it generates a footnote for each textArea which contains the footnote macro, even if I place putFootnotes in another textArea at the end of the class (and using macros is not exactly user-friendly for end-users).  \n21:18\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0So, the main question is: is there any other extension that I'm missing which might solve my problem straightforward or should I customize one of those?  \n22:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi barretto  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry it's late here and I'm going to bed  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I suggest  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that you send all this information and questions on the xwiki users mailing list  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the best way for you to get some feedback/answer on that  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/MailingLists  \n23:01\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0great, thanks!  \n23:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yw, nn  \n23:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
