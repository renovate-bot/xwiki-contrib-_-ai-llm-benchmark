There's also history, being able to write db queries, being able to search using Solr  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that doesn't change the store  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just the way to access it  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the idea would be to be able to plug a FM UI in xwiki for any VFS. But yes if you wish to have the search feature in your FM UI then you'll need to search using the NIO2 API  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes I agree it's complex  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not sure about the real world use cases at this stage anyway :)  \n12:20\u00a0<ClemensR1>\u00a0Some recent user (admin) feedback: People really like the new feature to extend the menues via extension points in 7.3 :)  \n12:24\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has quit  \n12:25\u00a0<ClemensR1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:36\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:39\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n12:48\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:12\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:12\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n13:38\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n13:39\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n13:56\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:12\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has quit  \n14:17\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:31\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0is now known as <cjd>  \n15:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:48\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:53\u00a0<sdumitriu3>\u00a0has quit  \n16:54\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:05\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:08\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:46\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has quit  \n17:47\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:56\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:56\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:56\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:51\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:00\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:06\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool thanks mflorea :)  \n20:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0;)  \n20:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:00\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
