It is more standards-compliant than almost all the other databases, and it is also faster  \n08:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO the opposite is more dangerous  \n08:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0saying that it's production ready  \n08:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We should run some performance tests  \n08:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then getting users saying that xwiki is not working  \n08:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it's slow  \n08:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm not saying that we should say it's production ready  \n08:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that you cannot say \"provided the wiki stays small\"  \n08:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that has not specific meaning  \n08:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Just say in a less offensive way that other databases should be used  \n08:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I'm fine with that if we find the right worjing  \n08:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wording  \n08:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I wrote this  \n08:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I almost changed it  \n08:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thinking that if the hsqldb guys read it they might be offended  \n08:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but my worry was for them not for our users  \n08:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm fine to find a less aggressive wording  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0production for me means: tunability to handle large number of users, powerful admin tools, backups solutions, replication solutiosn, etc  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we could say instead  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that our standalone package is not produciton-ready  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not tuned to handle large volumes for example, nor is it tuned with correct # of threads, cache values, etc)  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbiab  \n08:57\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0\"production ready\" can mean a lot of things, to some people it just means \"it's gonna eat your data\" which couldn't be further from the truth.  \n08:59\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0My understanding is it borrows threads from the http thread pool since calls are made directly, this is theoretically one of the best possible solutions from a performance standpoint.  \n09:01\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0\"While HSQLDB is a mature, stable, and high performance database, it keeps the dataset in memory which is inappropriate for large deployments\" or something the like?
