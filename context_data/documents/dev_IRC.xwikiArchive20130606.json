It's that slow that we can't even test properly, an upgrade takes sometimes more than 1 hour !  \n12:42\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I mean more thourough  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: don't mix issues  \n12:42\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am not.

I am starting it with java -jvat start.jar  \n13:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Tomcat is conservative and lets the sysadmin tune it  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they all do  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're java apps  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so they can't control it anyway  \n13:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, so by default Jetty starts with more memory than Tomcat ?  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it only dpends on the script you use to start the jvm  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: again no  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again it's only the JVM  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the contauner runs \\*\\*inside\\*\\* the JVM  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has no control on the JVM settings  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's only the startup script that starts the JVM with the memory settings  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what's not clear with that....  \n13:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, I understand that. I am just trying to figure out why clean jetty works and clean tomcat doesn't. I am not modifying any memory setting.  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you run java -jar start.jar  \n13:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so this means that they both should start with the default JVM memory  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you say: start with default JVM memory settings  \n13:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0exactly  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and again  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the difference is that container have their own code and third party libs to load  \n13:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I'm just trying to get an OOM on a clean jetty :)  \n13:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I see  \n13:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0call a page with the code macro in it  \n13:20\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0sburjan: Run a {{code}} macro  \n13:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that should help  \n13:20\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0run a {{grrovy}} macro  \n13:20\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And you should get some  \n13:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, let's see  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0run yourkit  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll see the memory used in realtime  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and what uses the memory  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when gc is called  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bb in 1 hour  \n13:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: bingo. Permger  \n13:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\\*permgen  \n13:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so jetty is a little bit lighter than tomcat this is why it didn't fail .. while under the same JVM memory \u00a0Tomcat failed  \n13:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0is this a rational explanation ?  \n13:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but using the code macro in a jetty container, quickly permgen'd  \n13:31\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, that's the explanation  \n13:32\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Compare the size of the jars in jetty/lib and in tomcat/lib  \n13:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: they both have 6 MB  \n13:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Really?  \n13:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n13:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I have 3M for Tomcat and 1.5M for Jetty  \n13:35\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Oh, also note that Jetty doesn't load all of them  \n13:35\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I have compared their size on disk  \n13:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: Tomcat 6 or 7 ?  \n13:36\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0sdumitriu: maybe you have a different version  \n13:36\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Depends on what OPTION do you pass to start.jar  \n13:36\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a07  \n13:36\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But I have Gentoo, which is tuned  \n13:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, but you have tomcat and jetty downloaded from thei official website as a zip or installed using emerge ?  \n13:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but.. they are jasrs, so what gentoo specific optimizations can they have ...  \n13:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0(confused)  \n13:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0emerge  \n13:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I have the zip download, and my Tomcat/lib has 6.2 mb  \n13:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/7PHyiVXD  \n13:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Also, keep in mind that PermGen is for all applications  \n13:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And Tomcat comes with a few apps as well  \n13:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0manager, docs  \n13:42\u00a0<chalx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:48\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:52\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n13:52\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan`>  \n13:59\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Anyway, we clearly document the memory requirements  \n14:00\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: yes indeed, Tomcat comes with other apps as well.
