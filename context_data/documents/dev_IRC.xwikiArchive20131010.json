Any idea in how to reproduce this?  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure yet I'll be able to fix it (depends on the complexity) but first I need to reproduce/understand when it happens  \n09:13\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: if I edit Blog.BlogIntroduction, and then migrate to another version of XWiki shoudln't I get a merge conflict in the DW for that page ?  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only if there's a conflict msmeria ;)  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0other it'll merge the changes without asking  \n09:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0what defines a conflict ?  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*otherwise  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when it cannot perform a 3-way merge between: original version, your version and new version.

For sure lots of companies have already scanned xwiki for security and this has never been reported so far  \n11:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see what this has to do with security either  \n11:37\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0tmortagne: not this exceptions but it is never a good Idea to print exception with sensitive Information like code line versions and so on to public  \n11:38\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0tmortagne: I would preferr a way that the user is informed that there was an error, with an reference. With this refrence a user with admin rights or something can get the exception  \n11:38\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0tmortagne: that this that is mean as Information Leakage  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0ok but since xwiki is open source you can always look at the source  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0so it's probably less an issue than with closed software  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(where it's security by ignorance)  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(compared to security by more eyes)  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n11:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0on a brand new compiled snapshot, when I start xwiki-enterprise:  \n11:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Caused by:  \n11:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau> at  \n11:40\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0vmassol: yes your right but it needs than a deeper view to it to use it instead of running some robots against productive sites  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah ok sure but IMO it's still small priority vs other security issues we know about ;)  \n11:42\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0vmassol: yes it is, but I thing it's worth to take a look at it cause it can give you more time to fix secuirty problems  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FYI security issues are marked \"confidential\" in our jira  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and they're hidden by default  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have a special security mailing list to discuss them  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Panther\\_1: ok  \n11:51\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0vmassol: I found this https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Information\\_Leakage \u00a0said all to it  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: same for me, vmassol looks like you made a mistake when modifying the component.txt  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"script.script\"  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry about that  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where?

If not I'll go for \"Dependency upgrades\"  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can be changed anyway  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm maybe I should rename \"Build, Infrastructure and Tests\" into \"Non-runtime issues\" or \"Development Issues\"  \n16:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: \"Dependency upgrades\" sounds good  \n16:08\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0how should I instanciate a component which is not a singleton?  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: getInstance from CM  \n16:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok, thx  \n17:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0how can I configure default values for a property in xwiki.properties?  \n17:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have created this setting to make AS module ignorant of the other modules  \n17:05\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: and it doesn't work :)  \n17:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0what do you mean?  \n17:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it works, I just need to fill this property  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it means that with your solution AS is dependent on wiki manager whichi s bad  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as sergiu said you're just pushing the problem and I kind of agree with him  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my preferecne still goes to my earlier suggestion  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I haven't thought for long enough to provide a definitive answer  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all I know is that having AS know about wiki events seems a hack and deosn't answer the general need of a module/extension wanting to not log some events either permanently or temporarily  \n17:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0OK, imagine Wiki Manager can add some events to ignore in the ignore list of AS  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are lots of solution, like for example an interface provided by AS so that other modules can provide a filter for ex  \n17:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0we do not provide default value  \n17:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and it should work, no ?  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I think so  \n17:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but as I said earlier I'm not sure we need to have a configuration property for this  \n17:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes, we can drop ot  \n17:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*it  \n17:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sdumitriu: I like your idea  \n17:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0BTW, I still have java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.xwiki.diff.script.script.DiffScriptService  \n17:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau> at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202) on a snapshot  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ci has rebuilt it : http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Commons/job/xwiki-commons/1099/  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but platform is failing  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-search-lucene-api/4496/testReport/junit/com.xpn.xwiki.plugin.lucene/LuceneAnalyzerTest/searchWithStandardAnalyzer/  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu/all: anyone against closing http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6345# as won't fix now since it's oldish?  \n17:51\u00a0<ldubost2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<ldubost2>\u00a0is now known as <ldubost>  \n17:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:23\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:30\u00a0<Slash\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:48\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n21:08\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:10\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:13\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n21:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:13\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n22:42\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:00\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit\n"}
