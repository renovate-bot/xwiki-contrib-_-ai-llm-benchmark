 \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: no way but we can have exclusions  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at the maven level)  \n10:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0so you need to update the extension  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's on contrib I think  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-crash  \n10:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0probably yes, not my job then ;)  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone can update contrib  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: the first thing to do is write a comment on the crash extension page in the compat field  \n10:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0is as your matter  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to explain that the current version of crashub app is broken  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not really  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you broke it  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I actually commented about it  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0breaking backward compat is bad  \n10:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0if we need to manage all written extension, we will die  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well here we know about it  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it was mentioned in the pom  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you still broke it  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'd say it's your job to fix it  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I have added a not in the RN about the fact that BC has been update and is not binary compatible  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've having a ahrd time with keeping extensions working  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when we know we're breaking something we need to take some action  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the very minimum is to write in the comapt field on e.x.o  \n10:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0writting RN is the action that should be taken  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how does that help users?  \n10:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the maintainer of the extension has to follow up  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you voluntarily broke crash  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you know it  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you can at the very least put it in the compat field on e.x.o  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0breaking backward compat is already bad  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again  \n10:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I do not know anything about CRaSH, this was just a example of what could have been broken  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you decide d to break it by tyourself  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0without asking  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even worse  \n10:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0there are potential many other extension that could have been broken, and not only by my update  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but you know about this one  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just tested it  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so please fill the compat field on e.x.o  \n10:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0upgrading to the latest version of a library is a normal process, especially since it fix security issues  \n10:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I 'll do to be please with you, but my feeling is that is not fair for other extension maintainer  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're refusing to help keep e.x.o up to date  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very nice mentzilty  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0me,tality  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mentality  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:(  \n10:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I just say, I will do  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you test something, it break and you don't want to report it  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's all I was commenting on  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you made it generic  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't have any generic way to validate extensions  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it has to be manual ATM  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and this is a hard job  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorin/manuel help quite a lot but it' s up to xwiki community at large to help do this job ATM  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we want to have satisfied users that is  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because right now I hear a lot of complaints  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0about users who try extesnions and find that they are failing  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(out of 5, usually 3 are failing)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's what they tell me/us)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we do have an issue  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one solution would be to change the way our dep mgmt work  \n10:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0IMO, maintaining extension is the job of the extension maintainers, do you think any other software editor, having extension like Chrome, take any care to check them for compatibility ?  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie not allow installing by default a version that is higher than the declared dep  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example if the extensions says it need platform-xxx-5.2  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you're on 5.3  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it doesn't install by default unless you force it  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be a pain though but if combined with community input it coud work  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if someone says: it works on 5.3 then EM would allow it  \n10:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0could be something we need to do, I agree with all you say, do not be mislead by may earlier talk  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a bit complex to set up though...  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0denis: re \"maintaining extension is the job of the extension maintainer\"  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that doesn't help us  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from the POV of users, they see \"xwiki\"  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it works or it fails  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: ofc, I know that  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc there will be some verified app stores in the near future  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that still doesn't solve the issue completely  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because most users will still go the e.x.o store  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we need to have a good quality level there  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or they'll drop xwiki since it \"doesn't work\"  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your comment is not precise enough, fixing  \n10:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: you are the maintainer of the CRaSH extension, I really encourage you to update it ;)  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0imagine we release 1.1 with fixed dep  \n10:33\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your comment will be wrong  \n10:34\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n10:34\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0when you release, you need to update, no ?  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we remember yes  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0compatibility field could be improved  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and could be linked to a version  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: yes, I've improved it too  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could have several objects for comapt field  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with a version field in those xobjects  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the same way that we have RN depend on a version  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be part of the RN xobject  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one field for the RN per say and one field for compat info  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would probably make more sense  \n10:39\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0agreed  \n10:41\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0BTW, why the CRaSH API has no entry on e.x.o ?  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9642  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: because I didn't want to expose it/document it  \n10:42\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this confuse me, since it was a stated deps of the other one, and in fact the one to fixed  \n10:42\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and, I was wondering what it contains, since there is already two extension using it  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0two extensions?  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using what?  \n10:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yes there is a CRaSH console by Jerome  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it's not using the api I created  \n10:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0doesn't this one also based on it ?
