I replied to vmassol  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I replied to the list  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0and I saw :)  \n13:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: hello, I understand there is a requirement that all contrib projects list org.xwiki.contrib as the parent, this is why I've not asked yet to include xwiki-platform-realtime-editor in contrib since it inherits from platform..  \n13:47\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0sburjan: could you check if you have duplicated jars on different versions  \n13:48\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0XE does not have the issue so maybe wikimanage or appmanager have a dependency in a version different than the one in XE for some reason  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: that shouldn't be a problem  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you need to define what you need  \n13:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If it's important to use contrib and change the directory structure, I'll open an issue for it  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0cjd: org.xwiki.contrib does not have to be the parent actually, it has to be the groupid prefix  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: I've tried to explain the reason to use contrib over your own repo, dunno if I've convinced you  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me it's important  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we can't force any contributor  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's their choices  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0sop that your extension is deployed somehwre in http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/contrib/  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0you can use whatever you want as parent  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0s/sop/so/  \n13:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well the parent thing is good since changing the parent is the most painful with all of the versions  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: I'd be curious to know why you need platform as parent though since there's very little in the platform parent pom  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and it's not supposed to be reusable by outside project btw  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0)  \n13:52\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0s/whatever/whatever parent/  \n13:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I wrote it so that it would be possible to include in xwiki-platform-core without any modification  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's a valid point  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway as thomas said you can use whatever parent you wish  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and even for the group id, you could use the platform one provided  \n13:53\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0IMO what's important is the groupId, all the rest should be free  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you send a vote and there's an agreement to merge this contrib project in platform  \n13:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0how about the artifact id? is xwiki-platform-realtime ok?  \n13:54\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0yep it's ok IMO  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah on this we have started some differet modules with Enygma` for autocompletion  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me find it  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0related to editors  \n13:54\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0yea then there could be collision with other contrib sure  \n13:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm pretty sure everything is different now, I modified the pom.xml files pretty thoroughly  \n13:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the groupid is not very hard, what is hard is reorganizing the directory structure twice, that's what held me back from pushing to contrib earlier.. seeing that you guys have no objections to the platform centric dir structure it doesn't seem like a major issue at all  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: re the artifactid it doesn't matter, we can change it later on if/when we decide to integrate in platform  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: that reminds me that we haven't integrated autocomplete in platform\u2026 nor published it on e.x.o\u2026 oops :(  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I had started but stopped)  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I have uncommitted changes locally about that)  \n14:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0off topic: go is an incredibly interesting language, it's like C for the 21st century and there's nothing in the spec preventing implementations from becoming insanely fast  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: I know  \n14:24\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0sburjan, I just downloaded xwiki-manager-jetty-mysql-4.3-milestone-1.zip and started it and it works fine (I mean it starts up and I can log to the home without any exception)  \n14:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0nothing in the console ?  \n14:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0fmancinelli: note I am using with MySQL  \n14:25\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0yep me too  \n14:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok. trying again  \n14:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0maybe someone else could try. a 3rd party :)  \n14:26\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0I just had a pre-existing database... it did the migration and then I was presented with the home page (Main Wiki....

Right now I notice that the page with configurable class has PR and the core runs well there, but when I access it from Administration>Applications, PR does not work and the code fails.  \n16:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ConfigurableClass makes a dropPermissions() call which precludes using PR in it without {{include}}  \n16:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and now the question: why? :)  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: security, you have several example or how to use include macro to have an admin page that require PR  \n16:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0because ConfigurableClass pages are included without context=new and the PR is checked for XWikiPreferences instead of the other page?  \n16:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0correct  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no include for an object  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and the admin page content is in an object from admin point of view  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's a bit of a pain to do a safe include of the Configurable content in admin UI using velocity  \n16:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but why don`t we use context=new by default for Applications? (ConfigurableClass)  \n16:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Applications usually care about their domain, not about XWikiPreferences  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: what does that mean using context=new ?  \n16:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(to me) making sure that PR is checked for the page the include comes from and not the page that it is rendered on (XWikiPreferences)  \n16:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as i just said it's a pain to do in velocity that's all, when we \u00a0will add object support to display macro then we can use it  \n16:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: you mentioned some examples, can you please name one so I can look it up?  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there used to be EM but I don't think it's a ConflurableClass anymore, I think you have search admin with this need  \n16:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0actually searchAdmin is what I am working with :)  \n16:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not search actually  \n16:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0let me see I don't remember  \n16:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway the idea is to use include another page with context=new  \n16:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok then, I see  \n16:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thank you  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: I can create a component for you  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(jira component)  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCONTRIB#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Realtime Editor\"  \n17:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you need to do a release you'll have to create a version too  \n17:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think I have the pom set up correctly so releasing should make it ExtensionManager compatable  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n17:31\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0hmm, an entry of an appwithinamin doesnt inherint the access-rights of the app... so although the app is restricted, even a non-registered user can see its entries.  \n17:34\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0i guess i missed something.  \n17:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<coud>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:04\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0ok, how to let this expression be false? \"$xwiki.hasAccessLevel('register', 'XWiki.XWikiPreferences')\"  \n18:05\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0i want to disable/hide the register-link in the menuview.vm  \n18:06\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0(registering is done via ldap)  \n18:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cdop: go in the administration  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in the right administration you can remove the register right given to guest user by default  \n18:18\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't forget to select \"Users\" in the table  \n18:19\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0found it thanks!  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0You're Welcome :)  \n18:22\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0:)  \n18:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:41\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n20:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:29\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:46\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:50\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0has quit  \n21:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:13\u00a0<coud>\u00a0has quit  \n22:20\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:38\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:46\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:53\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n22:59\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n23:10\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:12\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
