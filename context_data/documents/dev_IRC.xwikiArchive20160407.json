Has anyone tried using xwiki with SQLServer? Or is it safe to use HyperSQL in a prod environment?  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fkh: we usually recommend MySQL in production. hsqldb is mostly stored in memory so not great for a big instance (we mostly use it for test)  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0many people seems to be using postgres too  \n11:49\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or postgresql or oracle, any of the supported DBs basically  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DatabaseSupportStrategy )  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't spend time maintaining SQLServer but when someone sends a patch for it we can apply it  \n11:57\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hello sympa users, I didn't receive my own mail to xwiki user list anymore, anyone else have this problem?  \n11:57\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Of course \"Receive your own posts to the list\" is checked to Yes  \n11:58\u00a0<fkh>\u00a0Thank you guys for the answers, I'll check if MSSQL is running and if not will fall back to Oracle since those are the only two supported DBs where I work  \n11:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I recommend using XWiki on Oracle since this is supported, there are people using it on MSSQL but we don't know whether they have \"minor\" issues which they choose to work around.  \n12:00\u00a0<fkh>\u00a0Thx, admins are pushing towards MSSQL that's the only reason I was asking about it, otherwise Oracle is fine for me ;)  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: hi, could you point me to the place in the wysiwyg code where we check if the syntax can be edited in wysiwyg?  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie if there's a parser and renderer for that syntax I imagine)  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found it  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WysiwygEditorScriptService.isSyntaxSupported  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: btw the wysiwyg editor supports xwiki/1.0 syntax?

 \n12:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing it  \n12:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0keep only isSyntaxSupported  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys could you check my last comment at http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-443?focusedCommentId=90954&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-90954  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0about the html/4.01 renderer  \n12:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: same kind of \u00a0comment I did an a recent mail, we moved to html 5 so I don't see much value in investing time on a html/4.01  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but it's the same question  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we want to allow users to edit some version of html/xhtml in the wysiwyg editor  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now they can't  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't have any valid combination of html/xhtml parser and renderer  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a bit lame, knowing that the wysiwyg editor operates in html/xhtml :)  \n12:47\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we need to do a html 5 parser anyway so sure  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that the html5 renderer is probably wrong  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's probably an XHTML 1.0 renderer  \n12:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cheecking  \n12:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a customized xhtml renderer  \n12:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0extends XHTMLChainingRenderer  \n12:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd need ti check the HTML5 spec  \n12:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but what is important is that it's officially produceing html 5, if it's not in some place then it's a bug  \n12:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to see if it says it's XHTML  \n12:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not that it's XHTML but what Guillaume told me is that XML is valid in html 5  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not the issue  \n12:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in other word it's not strict  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue is whether we're transfomring non XHTML into XHTML  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so imagine you have some html5 input  \n12:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you edit in wysiwyg and just save with no change  \n12:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it shouldn't convert your input  \n12:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we have this on any syntax  \n12:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nothing to do with xhml vs html  \n12:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you have  \n12:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in xwiki/2.x you will end up with  \n12:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't remember the detail in the rendering event, just the meaning  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes unfortunately (and that's a know bug)  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*known  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's say limitation :)  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes I agree  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the generated html 5 is fully valid it's acceptable probably  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue might be to convert HTML5 into XHTML 1.0  \n12:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we might loose stuff  \n12:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but there is one thing we are missing and we need to add for this use case: support for comments blocks, right now you will loose them because the rendering API does not have any idea what is a comment. the minimum would be to produce unknown block for comments in the html parser  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless we modify the WYSIWYG editor to use HTML5 instead of XHTML1.0  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not sure how that would work out  \n12:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the WYSIWYG is not really XHTML  \n12:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's some HTML we then cleanup  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it converts to XHTML 1.0  \n12:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it convert to something the xhtml parser will support  \n12:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not exactly the same as producing valid xhtml 1.0 :)  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0parse input syntax \u2014> XHTML 1.0 \u2014> make modifis \u2014> parse as XHTML 1.0 input -> render as input syntax  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/XHTML 1.0 \u2014>/render as XHTML 1.0 -->  \n12:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is more important IMO is what CKEditor does  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep, what it supports  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now we do the same  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xhtml/1.0 \u00a0as input to CK I believe  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ?

I'm moving on to something else now  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acotiuga: I'm merging your PR.
