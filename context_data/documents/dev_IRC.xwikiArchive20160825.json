Apparently there is some behaviour change between 7.0.62.0 and 7.0.70 which results in the impossiblity to edit pages with spaces in them (it results in creation of page with + signs in xwiki)  \n09:16\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0vmassol: hello, I've found today (since i've done yesterday upgrade to 8.2.1) that XWIKI-13651 also affects this version, so I'm actually wondering if its caused by XWIKI-12544 or not  \n09:21\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, so it looks like it's combination of two issues  \n09:22\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0sometimes it fails with \"Cannot read property 'observe' of undefined\" and sometimes it tries to load that tree.js file but in edit mode that results in Locked response code when two people on wiki are trying to edit at the same time  \n09:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: hi  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you're using 8.3M1 you should be fine regarding the tree.js issue since it's been fixed  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the export of children is part of 8.3M1 so there's no reason for you to have the problem normally  \n09:39\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0vmassol: it's 8.2.1  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you don't have XWIKI-12544 for sure in that version  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIU XWIKI-13651 was vaused by XWIKI-125444 yes  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding tomcat there's no known issue with spaces  \n09:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, looks that way although it looks similar  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but there are general encoding issues  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in some version  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as we indicate  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationTomcat  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the red box :))  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm sure you're hitting those  \n09:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0aaah, yes, thats it :)  \n09:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0I will try to reproduce the CKEditor issue on clean installation and report a bug then :)  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks Alex  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you could also add the missing WebHome in the examples (haven't checked but that's a guess)  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it seems the tutorial is not valid  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anymore  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes for example $xwiki.jsx.use(\"XWiki.SkinExt\") is not \u00a0going to work by default  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since by default pages are created non terminal  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we should indictae to create a page as a terminal page and point to the doc for that  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw just realized were missing documentation for terminal pages at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/DocumentLifecycle#HCreate, adding that  \n09:54\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n09:55\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:58\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0added the missing WebHome on SkinExtensionTutorial  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be better to create a terminal page though since I'm not sure why a ssx page would have children but ok...  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least it makes it simpler for the non advanced user  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(although it's an advanced concept)  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not easy  \n10:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR I've updated http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/DocumentLifecycle We forgot to udpate it when we introduced the terminal page checkbox in the create page dialog and when we introduced the new templates recently...  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we need to be more careful about documentation in the future  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lots of users are complaning that the doc is obsolete, and they're right  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: hi  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: could you update http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/DocumentLifecycle#HExport please?  \n10:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: maybe we could link to http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/Exports  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the link is there already  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we could just link to it without adding the screenshots  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/Exports we need to show a better screenshot too  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with the children selection feature  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the children selection is only implemented for XAR?  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not for HTML for example?  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's there for html  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's only for HTML and XAR  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's ok  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought we were supporting multiple pages for PDF too  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but maybe you just didn't implement it  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, what do you think about introducing a UserReferenceSerializer to generate a user string. I'd like to remove some code duplication and improve the display when the guest user is not allowed to do somehting. For example if you have an include or display macro, we generate an exception with \"[Current user [null] doesn't have view rights on document [lescastcodeurs:CKEditor.VelocityMacros]]\". Would be nicer to say \"Guest user [Guest]  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea, gdelhumeau, thomas (not here): wdyt?  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR here's the code in the include macro: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/79bc1823e5bb75ce54ed771f646b61b8b294f544/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-rendering/xwiki-platform-rendering-macros/xwiki-platform-rendering-macro-include/src/main/java/org/xwiki/rendering/internal/macro/include/IncludeMacro.java#L150-L150  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the same exist for the display maro)  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*macro  \n10:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: you mean a UserReferenceSerializer that generates \"Guest\" for null reference? I'm not that sure about this, because we won't have a resolver that generates null reference from \"Guest\"  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but seralizer do not mean you can go back to parse them  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just a representation  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and this serializer woud generate a printable representation  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(a pretty print representation if you prefer)  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0input: document reference, output: pretty print representation of the current user  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ex: \"Vincent Massol (xwiki:Vincent.Massol)\"  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ex2: \"Guest\"  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wouldn't mind using another terminology such as Displayer but we don't have a generic component interface for that  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case it's still possible to write a resolver to resolver it back into a DocumentReference  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(should it be needed)  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I was just hit by http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13653  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not me but a user of a wiki I've set up: lescastcodeurs.myxwiki.org)  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could go back to GWT but would be nice to use CK  \n10:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, CK is a XAR extension, this will happen with any XAR extension. i.e. imagine that you install an application and you give view rights only to the application home page. If the home page includes other pages (from some code space for instance) it won't work correctly  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I understand the problem mariu  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0marius  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not talking about all use cases, just this one which is a major one  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and a regression)  \n10:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we need \"include as author\"  \n10:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the general use case maybe we need a marker at page level to tell that a page should be viewable independently of permissions, or something like this  \n10:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or what you say yes  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(even better)  \n10:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0include with the rights of the content author  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have something similar in a few places already  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like SUExecutor  \n11:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the downside is that it will require PR and it will cause issue on subwikis  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why require PR?  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we consider that a page is safe, we could allow it to be viewed always no?  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw on my screenshot we can see that the skin is not being displayed fine either which is a similar issue  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but at least some skin is displayed so it's less criticial)  \n11:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0actually no, it doesn't require PR, it will just perform the include with the rights of the content author  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/DocumentLifecycle#HExport updated  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thx  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahah you found a clever way ;)  \n11:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0thanks :)  \n11:37\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:49\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:13\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0has quit  \n15:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0ah reminder to try to favor one the issues listed on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Roadmaps/ for BFDs  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(I had also forgotten which is why I'm sending this reminder ;))  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're not easy though\u2026  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've jsut reviewed them and they look too complex for me at least  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to achieve in 1 one day)  \n15:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:11\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n17:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:45\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:46\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:37\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:25\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:35\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:27\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n23:04\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit\n"}
