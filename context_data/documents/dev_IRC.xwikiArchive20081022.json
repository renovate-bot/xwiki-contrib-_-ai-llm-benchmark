Here's an example: http://repository.sonatype.org/  \nvmassol\\_ - (22/10/2008 12:05): one nice feature is the feeds  \njvdrean - (22/10/2008 12:10): vmassol\\_: nice  \nxwikibot - (22/10/2008 13:38): XWiki.trebea was modified by XWiki.trebea - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/trebea  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:46): thomasmortagne: dan\\_miron Hello :) re the XTXARPLUGIN issue with the package.xml taken from target/classes  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:47): it seems that the plugin takes everything from that directory, and relies on the fact that the resources have been copied there  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:48): I don't know if it's the correct behavior or not. I suppose it is, since vmassol wrote it :p   \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:49): jvelociter: yes resources are meant to be in src/main/resources and are copied in target/classes by the resource plugin  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:49): it's important we take them from there  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:49): since there can other plugins/tx that make modifications to them too  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:49): ok. In the case here, we have an issue since the plugin appends .xml to the document that do not have the extensions  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:49): so we only need to ensure that the resource plugin is executed  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:50): jvelociter: I don't think it should do that  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:50): again the plugin should have only 1 behavior  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:50): then we building a second file, the mojo finds a package.xml in target/classes (created by the first build)  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:50): having files without XML extension is a build error  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:50): (since we want xml file extensions)  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:50): no having file without xml extension is not a problem  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:51): the progin should not touch files  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:51): progin=plugin  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:51): so why did you say that:  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:51): it just have to filter them  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:51): \"we have an issue since the plugin appends .xml to the document that do not have the extensions\"  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:51): ?  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:51): i don't understand whi it add extension  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:51): ah right  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:51): we agree  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:51): but it could also fail  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:51): with an exception  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:52): if invalid files are detected  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:52): this yes but it has nothing to do with exception  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:52): extension  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:52): sorry  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:52): ok I'm a bit lost but I'm not sure what you're asking either  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:52): maybe I'm just jumping on an existing discussion  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 14:53): let me know if you need my help somewhere  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:54): jvelociter: \" the plugin appends .xml to the document that do not have the extensions\" why is that ? it's not what this plugin should do and it's not what it even did before http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XPXARPLUGIN-1 AFAIK  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:56): this name of file is generated by core exporter and only by that  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:56): thomasmortagne: ok, right  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:56): if xar plugin modify files in any manner it's a bug IMO  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:56): indeed it does not touch the file  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:56): so the problem is :  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:57): why the plugin searches for Space.Page.xml when the package.xml states \"Space.Page\"   \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:57): c.f.  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:57): Embedded error: /Users/jvelociter/xwiki-sources/trunks/applications/selenium/target/classes/Selenium/SeleniumTestClassSheet.xml isn't a file.  \njvelociter - (22/10/2008 14:57): <file language=\"\" defaultAction=\"0\">Selenium.SeleniumTestClassSheet</file>  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:57): if the problem is that the plugin did not found the wiki page in the sources the error is wrong  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:58): it should say that it can't find Selenium.SeleniumTestClassSheet  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:58): and yes it's a error  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:58): (IMO)  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:58): as it's an error for the importer AFAIK  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 14:59): btw this error make me think there is a problem in the plugin implementation  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:00): and it does not looks like what we discuss on how to do that, dan\\_miron ?  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:02): the plugin should not tryed to generate files names from what it find in package.xml (because it's impossible) but use the list from package.xml to filter files one by one  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:02): i'm going to look at the code  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:04): are you saying, thomas, that the plugin should look for files whose name resemble with the one specified in package.xml, no matter if they are ordinary files or xml ones?  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:06): no i'm saying files names has nothing to do here, the wiki page name is located in the files (as I already sayd you should look at how package.xml is generated) so the plugin should get the page name form file one by one and then check if the file has to be included in the package if it is listed in existing package.xml  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:07): oh, i see now  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:08): seems Sergiu wpplyed it too quickly I will revert it and let you fix the patch  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:08): anyway i planned to not apply anything before you finish the unit tests  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:08): it's just i wasn't expecting that a page name could differ from it's corresponding file name  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:09): as for the tests, i already found some maven plugin testing tools and wrote some code, and now i'm working on making it actually perform the tests  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:10): ok good  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:11): ?and there is also one more issue: \u00a0from what it has been discussed here  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:11): basically, the xarplugin should seek out for package.xml in the resouce folder and take the rest of the files from target/classes?  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:11): when building the archive  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 15:12): dan\\_miron: why?  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 15:12): I don't understand why you're making a difference between package.xml and the other files?  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 15:13): they should all come from target/classes IMO  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 15:13): (if package.xml exists of course)  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:13): vmassol: well, you said that ?yes resources are meant to be in src/main/resources and are copied in target/classes by the resource plugin  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:13): (03:49:09 PM) vmassol: it's important we take them from there  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:13): (03:49:24 PM) vmassol: since there can other plugins/tx that make modifications to them too  \nvmassol - (22/10/2008 15:13): yes and I maintain that :)  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:13): but on the other side,  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:14): vmassol: the problem is that the plugin need to make a difference between previously generated package.xml and source package.xml  \nxwikibot - (22/10/2008 15:14): Plugins.ApplicationManagerPlugin was modified by xwiki:XWiki.serasset - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Plugins/ApplicationManagerPlugin  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:15): if there is a package.xml from a previous buid in target/classed, but we remove the one from resource  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:15): so it can't just look at target/classes  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:15): and try to rebuild the project, the plugin will find the old package.xml which it'll take into account  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:16): maybe a solution would be to not generate package.xml in target/classes but directly write it in the xar package  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:17): it would work  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:18): IMO it sounds like a good sollution  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:18): ok so if no one is objecting let go this way ;)  \nxwikibot - (22/10/2008 15:21): Plugins.ApplicationManagerPlugin was modified by xwiki:XWiki.serasset - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Plugins/ApplicationManagerPlugin  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:22): thomas, but still this doesn't make things clear enough: if there is an existing package.xml in the resources, it'll be automatically copied in target/classes  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:27): and if we remove it from resources and then rebuild the project, the plugin will find package.xml in target/classes and take it into account  \ndan\\_miron - (22/10/2008 15:28): unless we set \u00a0up ?the plugin to look for package.xml in resources and not in target/classes  \nxwikibot -

(22/10/2008 15:32): hmm.... let me think  \nthomasmortagne - (22/10/2008 15:37): I would say play with package.xml from resource for now and see latter if we need to use the one from target  \nthomasmortagne -
