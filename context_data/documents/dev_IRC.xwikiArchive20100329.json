 \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:07): s/ho/how  \nlucaa - (00:09): you should go to AnnotationCode/AnnotationConfig  \nlucaa - (00:10): ( CalebJamesDeLisl )  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:10): Yes, looking at in inline mode, I see it now.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:10): Looks like the problem is $msg.  \nlucaa - (00:11): ah, yes, of couse  \nlucaa - (00:11): course  \nlucaa - (00:12): because there's a little msg in a label at one point which doesn't get displayed either  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:14): Hmm, I put thisisatest at the top of AnnotationConfigSheet and it doesn't show up either...  \nlucaa - (00:15): actually that form is generated  \nlucaa - (00:16): the codeToxecute has no effect whatsoever  \nlucaa - (00:16): I just deleted it  \nlucaa - (00:16): the form is generated automatically from the class to configure, probably, for all its fields  \nlucaa - (00:16): for the object in the document which holds the ConfigurableClass object I assume  \nlucaa - (00:18): however if I just write some text in the codeToExecute, I get it printed at the top of the form...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:19): Ahh, yes if you define a configuration class then it tries to generate a form for you.  \nlucaa - (00:20): well but if I don't, codeToExecute doesn't work the way I expect it to  \nlucaa - (00:21): {{include}} fails, #includeForm fails  \nlucaa - (00:21): (as in none displays anything)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:25): Ok, try editing AnnotationConfig to say: {{include document=\"AnnotationCode.AnnotationConfigSheet\"}}  \nlucaa - (00:26): right  \nlucaa - (00:26): but...  \nlucaa - (00:26): well... indeed doc says this way  \nlucaa - (00:27): that code to execute is just an extra that's added to the form created by setting the configuration class...  \nlucaa - (00:27): so I get my config doc in view mode  \nlucaa - (00:27): not inline  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:28): Yes, view mode, even if I specify inline in the url...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:28): http://127.0.0.1:8081/xwikiTrunk/bin/inline/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?xpage=admin&editor=globaladmin&section=Annotations  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:28): (which is why 'admin' right is useless.)  \nlucaa - (00:30): right, so I would need to build my form with ConfigurableClass objects...  \nlucaa - (00:30): for the admin section  \nlucaa - (00:30): but  \nlucaa - (00:30): well... actually no but  \nlucaa - (00:30): but it would be nice to be able to just include a document like this  \nlucaa - (00:31): because config panels could be custom...  \nlucaa - (00:31): though 98% of them will be standard list of properties to set  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:31): Something is wrong, I put $xcontext.getAction() at the top of AnnotationConfigSheet and it shows inline.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:34): Ok, $doc is not what you think it is... \u00a0$doc.display is trying to display something from XWikiPreferences.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:39): in codeToexecute: {{include document=\"AnnotationCode.AnnotationConfig\" context=\"new\"}}  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:41): Only problem is no form, that on purpose because I can't know where you might want to submit the content to and with what buttons.  \nlucaa - (00:43): but but  \nlucaa - (00:44): that wouldn't work for the admin action which is used by default for the prefs  \nlucaa - (00:44): since I want an inline form...  \nlucaa - (00:45): well what would be nice would be to be able to just provide a sheet for the document to which the configurable class object is attached  \nlucaa - (00:46): and the sheet would be rendered and submitted to the document  \nlucaa - (00:46): anyway, I can workaround on that too  \nlucaa - (00:46): I can check the action in the config sheet  \nlucaa - (00:46): and also add the button if it's admin action  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:46): Well Denis wants some changes to Configurable as well.  \nlucaa - (00:47): yeah, we should gather some feedback from the way we use it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:47): I agree there ought to be a way to include a document inside of a form.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:48): If you could #set($insideForm = true then you would get buttons, but #evaluate clears any variables when it's finished.  \nlucaa - (00:49): I don't think evaluate is the best function  \nlucaa - (00:49): why are you using evaluate and not xwiki.renderContent  \nlucaa - (00:49): or functions alike?  \nlucaa - (00:50): so that codeToExecute is not velo but wiki syntax?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:50): I wasn't thinking at the time I guess.  \nmarta1 left at 00:50 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:51): I was figuring on the main use being to generate a form from a class.  \nlucaa - (00:51): well, right now the {{include}} works only because #evaluate leaves it as it is, iiuc  \nlucaa - (00:51): as I said, it probably is  \nlucaa - (00:52): I mean probably 80% of the apps would use it to just generate a form  \nlucaa - (00:52): but even like this, codeToExecute would be nice to be wikisyntax  \nlucaa - (00:52): because if you want you can have velo in wikisyntax but not necessarrily the other way around  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:52): I think renderContent would clear variables when it ended too.  \nlucaa - (00:53): it's not only about vars  \nlucaa - (00:53): it just is nicer :)  \nlucaa - (00:53): and more inline with how xwiki works imho  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:53): And there is the matter of syntax, 1.0 or 2.0?  \nlucaa - (00:54): well, you could render it in the context of the document holding the configurable obj  \nlucaa - (00:54): and it would use that doc's syntax  \nlucaa - (00:54): I hope  \nlucaa - (00:54): (I mean it's just normal to work like that, I hope there's no bug and it does)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:55): Hmm, I see XWiki.renderText but that calls the 1.0 rendering engine.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:56): Anything else is PR.  \nlucaa - (00:56): ah noooo :(  \nlucaa - (00:56): and why not pr?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:57): That would be the one line which made Configurable require PR. And it proves that we can't do what we need with our own API.  \nsdumitriu left at 00:57 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:57): I don't like providing script to users then hiding behind java every time we want to do something, it doesn't look good.  \nlucaa - (00:58): well, I'd say configurable is pretty special  \nlucaa - (00:58): adding things to the administration panel is not something which makes sense to be done without pr  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:58): Subwikis?  \nlucaa - (00:59): but yes, we should have renderText() for syntax 2.0  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:59): What do you get for calling rendering engine instead of #evaluate?  \nlucaa - (00:59): rephrase, I don't understand  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:59): What is the advantage?  \nlucaa - (01:00): as I said, #evaluate evaluates that content as velocity  \nlucaa - (01:00): and it would be nicer if that content would be just wiki syntax  \nlucaa - (01:00): which would include a {{velocity}} macro if it needed velocity  \nlucaa - (01:00): maybe I want to write my script to execute in a different language  \nlucaa - (01:01): like groovy or whatever  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:01): You can, just use a groovy macro.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:01): If you use $ or # in groovy you might get into trouble because it passes by velocity first.  \nlucaa - (01:02): which would work because  \nlucaa - (01:02): {{groovy}}  \nlucaa - (01:02): doesn't mean anything in velo, and #evaluate renders it as {{groovy and it's picked up and all  \nlucaa - (01:02): and that's a bit wrong  \nlucaa - (01:02): as flow of rendering...  \nlucaa - (01:02): and yes trouble can come from the fact that velo is interpreted first  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:03): That was a big pain with 1.0 when I tried to use groovy to write velocity :)  \nanamarias left at 01:03 (Quit: anamarias  \nlucaa - (01:03): it would be nicer to be just wiki syntax, but if there's no choice in terms of API, I think we can leave it like that  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:04): But you can just use an include call in the codeToExecute text and then do what you want on the included page.  \nlucaa - (01:04): you mean #include ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:04): {{include or #includeForm it doesn't matter.  \nlucaa - (01:04): but then why wouldn't you just have a field called \"page to include\" ?  \nlucaa - (01:05): and do the #include() instead of #execute() ?  \nlucaa - (01:05): sorry  \nlucaa - (01:05): #evaluate I meant  \nlucaa - (01:05): anyway  \nlucaa - (01:05): there are solutions  \nlucaa - (01:05): it's not a problem of lack of solutions  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:05): I knew I couldn't expect all possibilities \u00a0so I was a generic as possible.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:06): s/a/as  \nlucaa - (01:06): I just feel it would be more in the spirit of xwiki if that field would be wikisyntax  \nlucaa - (01:06): now, if there's no renderText for 2.0. that sucks, and it means that it can't really be done  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:07): I tend to agree, I wonder what happens if we nested velocity macros :D  \nlucaa - (01:09): i should cd ~/bed now...  \nlucaa - (01:09): have a nice afternoon/evening (am I right?), see you tomorrow  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:09): Yes evening.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:10): #set($someCode = '{{velocity}}#set($lo = \"llo\") he$lo{{/velocity}}') \u00a0$someCode  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:10): We might be able to just paste wikisyntax into a page and make it evaluate :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:11): </hugeHack>  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:14): Going to get something to eat.

 \nlucaa - (11:00): lemme make a test  \ntmortagne - (11:00): why ?  \ntmortagne - (11:00): it's on line because you have two inline element in the same paragraph  \ntmortagne - (11:00): if you have onle a amcro without anything around it's standalone  \ntmortagne - (11:01): because there is nothing that makes it inline  \nlucaa - (11:01): ok  \nlucaa - (11:01): it's strange that a macro that doesn't output anything  \nlucaa - (11:01): makes the next macro inline  \nlucaa - (11:01): ...  \nvmassol - (11:01): not for me  \ntmortagne - (11:01): probleme is that parser has no idea what the macro will do  \nvmassol - (11:02): pretty natural  \nlucaa - (11:02): same for the AnnotationCode.CreateForm, where lines of velo code that don't output anything make the next html macro inline...  \nvmassol - (11:02): otherwise as a writer you'd have no way of knowing if your code is going to be inline or not  \nlucaa - (11:03): ok, I agree for the second case it could be hard to know, but for the first case it feels strange on the usage side...  \ntmortagne - (11:03): and as Vincent saif if that was than random there would be no way to properly handle inline/standalone in the wiki source  \nlucaa - (11:03): random?  \ntmortagne - (11:04): a macro is a black box for the rendering  \nlucaa - (11:04): right  \ntmortagne - (11:04): maybe it will produce something maybe not it has no way to know that  \nlucaa - (11:04): but they are executed in a series, aren't they?  \nlucaa - (11:05): I mean, I should know when I execute the second macro what has produces he first macro  \nlucaa - (11:05): or not?  \ntmortagne - (11:05): don't mix executin and parsing, theses are too different steps  \ntmortagne - (11:05): when you execute it we already decided the XDOM  \nlucaa - (11:06): I will assume this is the right way and resume adding new lines around the sources  \nvmassol - (11:07): lucaa: all this is simply becuase we've decided that NL are significant (rather than forcing users to use \\\\ when they want a new line for ex)  \nlucaa - (11:09): ok...

 \nvmassol - (19:12): so it's not about can or not can  \nnpm - (19:12): because you couldn't apriori figure out all the crazy random things users will do  \nvmassol - (19:12): is whether we will have it or not I guess  \nvmassol - (19:12): npm: yes but honestly it doesn't help  \nvmassol - (19:12): we do that with all milestones for ex  \ntmortagne left at 19:12 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (19:12): and we still have lots of bugs when we release the final  \nnpm - (19:12): the question is how large a test community do you have for the milestones  \nvmassol - (19:13): yes the pb is that everyone waits for the final  \nvmassol - (19:13): same as you here  \nnpm - (19:13): if the test community is basically people close to xwiki project, you may not cover enough use cases  \nvmassol - (19:13): you just mentioned you want to wait for it to be final before testing  \nvmassol - (19:13): in practice there are very few people willing to spend the time to test in advance  \nnpm - (19:13): no, i'd be willing to wait for just prior to final, in the hopes that when i find no bugs, i don't have to upgrade again.  \nvmassol - (19:14): right but it's too late  \nnpm - (19:14): but that practice might come from the release process that's occurred to date  \nvmassol - (19:14): it's ok only if there are no bugs  \nvmassol - (19:15): I think the pb arises now simply because we've taken risks we knew we weer taking in 2.2  \nnpm - (19:15): the thing is , if I upgrade to a maven release, i don't really know what relase version i'm at for qa purposes  \nvmassol - (19:15): and unfortunately not many people in the community cared  \nnpm - (19:15): and then i have to upgrade to final again  \nvmassol - (19:15): so they didn't bother testing the milestones  \nvmassol - (19:16): hence the 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3  \nvmassol - (19:16): (2.2.4 is different)  \nnpm - (19:16): i think the community cared, it's just that for a real test, an upgrade (for me) ends up being a > 1 day process (and that's w/o interruptions)...  \nvmassol - (19:16): for qa prupose you always know the ewact version you're testing  \nvmassol - (19:16): exact  \nvmassol - (19:16): since we use the svn revision in the version  \nnpm - (19:17): i can test badly in \"standalone\" that won't actually catch all the weird cases... it's the testing w/ deep integration into working wikis that catches the probs.. and those wikis are the ones people are most resistant to upgrading due to time/cost  \nvmassol - (19:17): npm: exactly  \nvmassol - (19:17): and for this you need to really use it in prodcution  \nvmassol - (19:17): hence the problem  \nvmassol - (19:18): this is one reason btw that I'd like to remove all notions of milestones in the future  \nvmassol - (19:18): s/that/for whic/  \nnpm - (19:18): so the thing is, i'm already willing to risk an upgrade to 2.2.4.. but if i find a probllem 1 day before release, you can skip another regression and release cycle  \nnpm - (19:19): but if i find a bug in \"maven release 234343\" nobody will know what release i'm taling about  \nvmassol - (19:19): of course we'll know  \nvmassol - (19:19): since that number is the svn revision  \nvmassol - (19:20): we can reproduce it  \nvmassol - (19:20): and thus fix it  \nnpm - (19:20): in other words, have a handful of people willing to test a relase prior to the full release . i'm willing to be one of those people  \nvmassol - (19:20): ok that's good to know and great already :)  \nvmassol - (19:20): \u2122   \nvmassol - (19:20): oops  \nvmassol - (19:20): thomas has left  \nvmassol - (19:20): but the release is going to happen tomorrow  \nvmassol - (19:21): so if you can do a quick test before tomorrow on the .2.2 branch that would be great  \ngvallarelli left #xwiki at 19:22  \nnpm - (19:22): will try. passover is tonight so i may not have enough time to finish...  \nvmassol - (19:22): Denis: you need a user name in lowercase  \nvmassol - (19:22): dgervalle  \nvmassol - (19:23): you can have 2 on xwiki.org if you want, one for svn and one for editing xwiki.org  \nDenis - (19:23): vmassol: do you mind to rename DenisG into denisg ?  \nvmassol - (19:23): you don't have the rights?  \nnpm - (19:23): re \"of course we'll know\" -- the xwiki team will know and understand, but outsiders trying to figure out if the bug/issue I find is related to their issue and versions.. then they'll be confused  \nDenis - (19:23): not currently, no  \nvmassol - (19:24): done: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/dgervalle  \nDenis - (19:24): euh, isn't denisg fine ?

It's not necessary to send a vote when performing minor or even sometimes substantial modifications provided the author judges everyone would agree to them. This is called lazy consensus.\"  \nvmassol - (23:34): this means that you're free to commit stuff but any committer could ask you to revert  \nvmassol - (23:35): i(if it was something not voted)  \nvmassol - (23:35): I tried to mimick what is done on apache  \nlucaa - (23:35): well... yes, but lazy consensus doesn't mean ignoring a vote mail, it means not sending it in the first place  \nvmassol - (23:36): http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#LazyConsensus  \nvmassol - (23:36): \"Consensus Gauging through Silence  \nvmassol - (23:36): An alternative to voting that is sometimes used to measure the acceptability of something is the concept of http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#LazyConsensus.  \nvmassol - (23:36): Lazy consensus is simply an announcement of 'silence gives assent.' When someone wants to determine the sense of the community this way, it might do so with a mail message such as:  \nvmassol - (23:36): \"The patch below fixes bug #8271847; if no-one objects within three days, I'll assume lazy consensus and commit it.\"  \nvmassol - (23:36): Lazy consensus cannot be applied to code changes when the http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#ReviewThenCommit policy is in effect.  \nvmassol - (23:36): \"  \nlucaa - (23:37): now, re unanswered vote || proposal mails (which we get enough), the right way to go is to privately ping some people who could answer the mail, or pinging on this chat, ore reviving the mail vote saying why it's needed to make a choice  \nvmassol - (23:37): yes  \nlucaa - (23:38): lazy consensus is interesting, but it assumes a declaration of such. as I said above, once it's a vote, even unanswered, it's still a vote (imho)  \nlucaa - (23:39): it cannot change importance only because no one answers, it's either an important change or not  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:39): In the case of that API change, I made a proposal of the general idea on the 15th, and there was discussion then, following that on the 22, I proposed something very much like what I committed, then on the 14 I proposed almost exactly what is committed and on the 25th changed it to a vote.  \nlucaa - (23:39): lazy consensus is actually super cool. To keep in mind...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:43): So to play the devil's advocate, lets suppose a vote is given and nobody is willing to give it +1 or -1, what happens?  \nvmassol - (23:44): you do lobbying first  \nlucaa - (23:44): first, the discussion above was about the general procedure  \nvmassol - (23:44): then if that fails you send a mail saying that if you don't get any answer in 1-2 days you'll commit anyway  \nvmassol - (23:44): that should get people to answer if they don't agree ;)  \nvmassol - (23:45): you may also  \nvmassol - (23:46): resend an email since if nobody answered it might be that your mail is too complex  \nvmassol - (23:46): you could split it into several smaller and simpler decisions  \nvmassol - (23:46): explain it differently  \nvmassol - (23:46): etc  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:46): I will try first the bothering people on irc, and then the \"If you don't vote I will commit\" method, IMO, 2 weeks is too long for a proposal like this to become a commit.  \nlucaa - (23:47): baseline is that you should try to make at least somebody else understand what you want to do and get them to have an opinion on it  \nvmassol - (23:47): it's not 2 weeks  \nvmassol - (23:47): it's 72 hours  \nvmassol - (23:47): + 1-2 days max  \nvmassol - (23:47): if it's longer it's because you haven't pushed it enough and you left it rot  \nvmassol - (23:48): (which can be ok if it's not urgent)  \nvmassol - (23:48): I have proposals I sent 2 years ago  \nvmassol - (23:48): and that are still not implemented  \nvmassol - (23:48): :)  \nvmassol - (23:49): ok bed time for me  \nvmassol - (23:49): nn see you tomorrow  \nlucaa - (23:49): nn vincent  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:50): Good night.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:50): I'll send a message that this vote has not gotten enough votes and is still open for a couple more days.  \nlucaa - (23:50): I think you'd better ping people to disagree if they need to  \nsdumitriu - (23:51): CalebJamesDeLisl: What helps is splitting the mail in two parts: The short version and The long version  \nsdumitriu - (23:51): The short version is 2-3 lines and summarizes the vote  \nsdumitriu - (23:51): The long version explains in more detaile the context, the problem, the proposed solution, the implications  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:51): I thought I did that, short version is a list of api methods.  \nsdumitriu - (23:52): This way, lazy people can just read the 3 lines and decide if they agree on the general idea, or if they want to read the longer version  \nlucaa - (23:52): yes, I agree this vote was pretty normal... except that it's a bit complicated, to understand what exactly happens. In this case an example would have helpeed  \nsdumitriu - (23:57): Jira still down  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:57): Interesting it doesn't explicitly say whether lazy consensus applies to voting.  \n\n"}
