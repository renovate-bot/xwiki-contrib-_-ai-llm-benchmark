I think it should be removed since it is too unreliable anyway  \nsdumitriu - (18:51): You can leave it there  \nnickless - (18:52): I could add an configuration option for it, but then the automated tests would only work with this option disabled  \nnickless - (18:52): (at least I couldn't find a way to add a custom referer header to selenium)  \nnickless - (18:53): (I mean a working one)  \nheadache - (19:07): there is another process that use localhost how can i shut down this process  \nsdumitriu - (19:10): kill  \nheadache - (19:19): \"The page isn't redirecting properly\"  \nheadache - (19:19): uhm?!  \nsdumitriu - (19:22): Probably a wrong URL  \nheadache - (19:23): http://localhost:8080/xwiki  \nsdumitriu - (19:23): What is the name of the XWiki webapp directory?  \nheadache - (19:25): \"distribution/jetty/hsqldb/target/xwiki....SNAPSHOT/\"  \nsdumitriu - (19:26): Do you have livehttpheaders?
