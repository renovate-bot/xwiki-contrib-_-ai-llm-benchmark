The elements and \"add\" is gone. what i want to archieve is to use \\*only\\* the menubar (or toolbar) tu use less space for the editor.  \n16:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0cdop: you cannot put any feature on the menu bar. Only a few plugins provide menus and menu items. So you need to revert the menu bar configuration. What you can do is to display only the toolbar  \n16:56\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0Ok, how to revert it? edit xwiki.cfg? and may i put the \"links\" button/plugin into the toolbar?  \n16:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0wait, why xwiki.cfg?  \n16:56\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0(thx for the fast answer btw)  \n16:56\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0well see here: http://weltenspiegel.de/private/xwiki/wysiwygcfg.png  \n16:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, easy, the configuration displayed there is stored in XWiki.WysiwygEditorConfig page  \n16:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you can simply rollback to one of its previous versions  \n17:00\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0oh, cant find that page... tried http://10.0.0.179:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Search?text=wysiwyg  \n17:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you can use the Jump To Page feature, Gtrl/Meta + G and then type XWiki.WysiwygEditorConfig, you'll get suggestions  \n17:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but you can also write the URL directly in the address bar, .../xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/WysiwygEditorConfig  \n17:04\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0Ok, only got one HistoryEntry though... should i delete it?  \n17:04\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0\"1.6 Administrator 2012/10/11 16:47 Imported from XAR Current version Delete\"  \n17:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0no, click show minor versions  \n17:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you have only one major version  \n17:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and by default only major versions are displayed  \n17:06\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0Ah, got it, thanks! Menubar is back and kicking, thankt  \n17:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0great. What you can do now is to uncheck \"Show source tab\" to hide the Source/WYSIWYG tags above the editor (you won't be able to see the source though, unless you switch to wiki edit mode) and you can also remove all the menu items to hide the menu  \n17:08\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0unfortunately not all features can be put on the tool bar.. see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/WysiwygEditor#HPluginsandFeatures for the list  \n17:10\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0oh, i see, so 2 bars is inevitable, but thanks for the last link!  \n17:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0as for your first question, you can put a macro shortcut on the toolbar ( http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/WysiwygEditor#HAddan27InsertHTMLmacro27buttononthetoolbar ) but it won't take the currently selected text  \n17:12\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0yeah, just read about the \"macro\"-toolbar-button, i guess thats what i will be using a lot then :)  \n17:13\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:13\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0this XE is very customizable, nice design, guys!!!!  \n17:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n17:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:38\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:58\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:25\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:52\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:55\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:06\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:03\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n22:46\u00a0<cdop>\u00a0has quit  \n22:59\u00a0<coud5>\u00a0has quit  \n23:12\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:36\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:37\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:44\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
