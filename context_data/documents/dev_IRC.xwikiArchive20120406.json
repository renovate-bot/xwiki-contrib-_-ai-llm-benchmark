I have written code, but not for the XWiki jira  \n00:14\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n00:16\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n00:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi jssolichin  \n00:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, any pull request is valid  \n00:20\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n00:33\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Ok so that section is mostly concerned with our capability to pull codes from eg. github, and not our coding ability--so we shouldn't just link codes we've written, but rather those written as forks. Great thanks Sdumitriu!  \n00:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You're welcome jssolichin  \n00:38\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n00:38\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n01:02\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Sorry, another question. The app asks whether I 'would be willing and able to do other projects instead.' Since I am interested in XWiki mobile dev, will listing this interest in one app (for responsive design) suffice, or should I also submit a different application for the mobile dev.  \n01:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0jssolichin: What project are you applying for in the first place?  \n01:04\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0sdumitriu: the responsive web design based on foundation.  \n01:04\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n01:04\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n01:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It should suffice, but if you have the time to write another application, you should do so  \n01:18\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Sdumitriu: If i am able to completely flesh out more ideas for the mobile dashboard, would it be ok to append it to the same application, since only the project aspect of the application will be different (I am after all one man) or should I submit a completely different one.  \n05:23\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n07:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:40\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0I wanted to confirm: XWiki's skin only applies to the front end yes?  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jssolichin: hi, wdym by front end?  \n08:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:29\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0vmassol: it doesn't effect the administration right? only what the public sees?  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jssolichin: it affects all view  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*views  \n08:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0view, edit, admin, etc  \n08:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or rather it can affect anyhing, depends what the skin implements :)  \n08:33\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0but it uses the same structure of actionbar/content area/panel/tabs? i guess my true question is, the administration section is not handled separately?  \n08:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki has tons of different views, we call them vm files  \n08:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or actions  \n08:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0edit, history, attahcments, delete, admin, etc  \n08:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a skin modifies those vm files  \n08:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Skins  \n08:37\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0ah ok i see, sorry I was going off: http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GettingStarted/XWikiEnterpriseBasicConcepts and the colibri skin pageto figure out the layout of the xwiki skin  \n08:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:42\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0Ok, i see how the skin process works. So I guess it is based more on modules than on \"page views\" Thanks for the link!  \n08:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n08:58\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:00\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:37\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:57\u00a0<Rajan\\_Mistry>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:17\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good mornin  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: re CM.lookupComponent() do we have enough replies?
