If you want, you can get the sources and build it yourself. Note, however, that the recommended enterprise version for this snapshot is 1.8.4. It will mainly work on a 1.9.1 too, but some issues might appear.  \nj-saturne - (04/08/2009 10:25): lucaa : I prefer get xar/jar, because I don't have a good build environnement for xwiki (tools, ...), if this is not a problem to go with the \u00a0continuous integration server, It's more simple for me. For 1.8.4, I know that, it's just a test with xwiki/watch  \nlucaa - (04/08/2009 10:38): j-saturne: here you go: xar: http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-wikis-watch/1.1-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-watch-wikis-watch-1.1-20090804.082446-1.xar client jar: http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-gwt-client/1.1-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-watch-gwt-client-1.1-20090804.082446-1.jar server jar: http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-gwt-server/1.1-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-watch-gwt-serv  \nj-saturne - (04/08/2009 10:39): lucaa : thks !  \nj-saturne - (04/08/2009 10:40): lucaa : last url it not good  \nlucaa - (04/08/2009 10:41): j-saturne: wdym?   \nj-saturne - (04/08/2009 10:42): lucaa : http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-gwt-server/1.1-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-watch-gwt-serv is broken  \nlucaa - (04/08/2009 10:42): server jar: http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-gwt-server/1.1-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-watch-gwt-server-1.1-20090804.082446-1.jar  \nj-saturne - (04/08/2009 10:42): ok  \nlucaa - (04/08/2009 10:43): probably the message didn't get through enire  \nlucaa - (04/08/2009 10:43): entire  \nasyd - (04/08/2009 10:43): there is xar release?  \nasyd - (04/08/2009 10:43): +no  \nj-saturne - (04/08/2009 10:47): lucaa : it works :)  \nj-saturne - (04/08/2009 10:47): lucaa : where can I add a feed ?  \nlucaa - (04/08/2009 10:49): go to the watch reader (if you're not already there)  \nj-saturne - (04/08/2009 10:49): view/Watch/Reader?xpage=plain ?  \nlucaa - (04/08/2009 10:50): yes  \nlucaa - (04/08/2009 10:50): in the left column, there is a little gear wheel where you can configure your reader.
