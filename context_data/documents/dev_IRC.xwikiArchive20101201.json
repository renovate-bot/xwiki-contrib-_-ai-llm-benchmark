Not sure we need the suffix since it's an extension space  \njvelociter - (11:45): yes I agree  \njvelociter - (11:45): now for former pages  \njvelociter - (11:45): like Applications.TagApplication  \njvelociter - (11:46): Extensions.Tag ? :/  \njvelociter - (11:46): or we keep the old suffix?  \nvmassol - (11:46): hmmm  \nvmassol - (11:46): there are possible classes  \nvmassol - (11:46): a tag plugin, tag snippet, tag applicaiton  \nvmassol - (11:46): s/classes/clashes/  \njvelociter - (11:46): yes  \njvelociter - (11:47): so we keep the suffix on a case by case ?  \nvmassol - (11:47): yes and the suffix is more the type rather than \"Extension\"  \nvmassol - (11:47): it's a better qualifier  \njvelociter - (11:48): yes. No suffix by default and when we need disambiguation we add the type  \njvelociter - (11:52): actually the page name does not matter too much  \nvmassol - (11:53): I think a type suffix would be a good best practice though  \njvelociter - (11:57): vmassol: actually yes  \njvelociter - (11:57): we should keep it for all IMO  \njvelociter - (11:57): (and it's easier for me now :) )  \nvmassol - (11:58): yes  \nvmassol - (12:12): jvelociter: do you know how to get the selected values from the bundledWith field?

 \njstoldt - (12:39): i think anything would be an improvement ;)  \njvelociter - (12:39): yes maybe  \nvmassol - (12:39): jstoldt: you're harsh, it's better than before  \nvmassol - (12:41): jvelociter: how do we get the livetable to sort on the titles and default to page name when no title?  \njstoldt - (12:41): vmassol: i didn't mean to be harsh, i meant anything that would actually sort the title by the alphabet would be an improvement  \njstoldt - (12:41): that means to say it doesn't really matter (to me) if it's the title of the page or the name of the page  \njvelociter - (12:41): vmassol: you have to modify the soure  \njvelociter - (12:41): \\*data source  \njstoldt - (12:42): because in this particular list they are pretty much exchangeable for all i can see  \nvmassol - (12:42): jvelociter: would be good to have jira issues for title handing for the LT  \nvmassol - (12:42): so that we don't forget to fix them  \njvelociter - (12:42): yes  \nvmassol - (12:42): for now I'll use page names on code.xwiki.org  \njvelociter - (12:43): I don't understand why getProperty('bundledWith').value gives me a string  \njvelociter - (12:43): that's not normal  \njvelociter - (12:43): I use to use this all the time for lists  \njvelociter - (12:43): + the javadoc says :  \njvelociter - (12:43): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Returns:  \njvelociter - (12:43): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the actual value of the property, as a String, Number or List.  \njvelociter - (12:43): http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/com/xpn/xwiki/platform/xwiki-core/2.6/xwiki-core-2.6-javadoc.jar/!/index.html  \njvelociter - (12:44): ah I know  \njvelociter - (12:45): vmassol: it's because you did not checked \"Multiple Select\"  \nvmassol - (12:45): jstoldt: done  \njstoldt - (12:45): awesome, thanks a bunch  \njvelociter - (12:46): vmassol: OK done  \nvmassol - (12:47): jvelociter: thanks  \njvelociter - (12:50): vmassol: we map old content field to description, and we leave summary empty OK ?  \njvelociter - (12:50): (for the migration)  \njstoldt - (12:50): sorts just fine now!  \nvmassol - (12:50): didn't we have summary before?  \nvmassol - (12:50): checking  \nvmassol - (12:50): it was \"description\"  \nvmassol - (12:51): (for applications)  \nvmassol - (12:51): old \"content\" is new \"description\"  \nvmassol - (12:51): :)  \njstoldt - (12:53): am i too blind to find some documentation on the container macro?  \nvmassol - (12:53): lucaa: ?  \njvelociter - (12:53): yes vmassol so we did not had summary right ?  \nvmassol - (12:54): it was called \"descirption\"  \njvelociter - (12:54): ah  \njvelociter - (12:54): description  \njvelociter - (12:54): ok  \njvelociter - (12:54): just for apps  \nvmassol - (12:54): yes  \nlucaa - (12:54): vmassol: ?  \nlucaa - (12:54): ah container macro  \nlucaa - (12:54): jstoldt: no, there is no documentation, yet, unfortunately  \nvmassol - (12:55): lucaa: yes, do we have doc for it and if not could you create it ?  \nlucaa - (12:55): but I could help you here, until the documentation is there  \nvmassol - (12:55): lucaa: better start the dc  \nvmassol - (12:55): will take the same amount of time and it'll be ther  \nvmassol - (12:55): :)  \nvmassol - (12:55): s/dc/doc/  \njstoldt - (12:56): okay, so what i am basically trying to achieve is a line at the end of a document where i got a left justified text with a link on the left and a right justified text with a link on the right  \njstoldt - (12:56): for navigation between pages that belong to gether  \nvmassol - (12:56): lucaa: remember the strategy: answer questions with a link ;)  \njstoldt - (12:56): so you could just like read to the end and then go to the next page  \njstoldt - (12:56): or previous...  \njstoldt - (12:57): so how would i apply the container macro (or any other) to achieve this?  \nlucaa - (12:58): there could be a trick you could use for the container macro  \njstoldt - (12:59): tell me all about it :-D  \nlucaa - (12:59): but normally, by default, the container macro does not handle this situation specifically  \nlucaa - (12:59): put your links in a container macro with layout columns, each in one column  \nlucaa - (12:59): {{container layout='columns'}}(((firstLink)))(((secondlLink))){{/container}}  \nlucaa - (13:00): I might be wrong on the param names, though  \nlucaa - (13:00): lemme try it  \njstoldt - (13:00): will try  \njstoldt - (13:00): {{container justify=\"true\" layoutStyle=\"columns\"/}}  \njstoldt - (13:00): btw, this is what i got from the WYSIWYG  \nlucaa - (13:01): edit and put the two groups in the content of the container  \nlucaa - (13:01): (((firstLink)))  \nlucaa - (13:01): (((secondLink)))  \nlucaa - (13:02): the links should be in wiki syntax, though  \njstoldt - (13:02): sure  \njstoldt - (13:02): okay, i get it to make some columns  \njstoldt - (13:02): no such luck for making secondlink justified to the right  \nlucaa - (13:04): wait I am still testing my hack  \nlucaa - (13:04): as I said, container macro is not made for this  \nlucaa - (13:04): I am testing my styling hack that should do the job  \nlucaa - (13:07): hack done  \nlucaa - (13:07): here's how you do it  \nlucaa - (13:07): in the second group  \nlucaa - (13:07): the second group, write it like this  \nlucaa - (13:08): (((  \nlucaa - (13:08): (%style='text-align: right;'%)  \nlucaa - (13:08): your link  \nlucaa - (13:08): )))  \nlucaa - (13:08): ( jstoldt ) and it will do the job  \njstoldt - (13:08): oh, splendid  \njstoldt - (13:08): i tried placnig that before ((( and it did not work  \njstoldt - (13:08): but your suggestion works  \nlucaa - (13:09): well, that's an undocumented feature ;) of the container macro  \njstoldt - (13:09): well, the container macro is an undocumented feature to begin with... ;)  \nlucaa - (13:09): it overwrites the style with it's own style, because it needs to produce the columned layout  \njstoldt - (13:09): yeah  \nlucaa - (13:09): it should merge, though, to be correct  \nlucaa - (13:09): but, if I am not wrong, that's an undocumented feature of the wiki syntax in general  \njstoldt - (13:10): anyway, it's still better having to install another unsupported macro  \nlucaa - (13:10): (%%)(%%)text  \nlucaa - (13:10): does not apply both styles  \njstoldt - (13:10): the (% style=\"...\" %)?  \nlucaa - (13:10): I need to check though  \nlucaa - (13:10): I mean the style attributes override eachother, don't merge  \njstoldt - (13:10): well, i kinda picked it up somewhere. i think somebody gave me the hint and i've been using it since  \nlucaa - (13:11): well, the idea is that style contains css  \nlucaa - (13:11): normally when you put 2 groups one after the other, the style attribute of the second group will override the style attr of the first group  \nlucaa - (13:11): when you'd expect the css to be merged  \njstoldt - (13:11): yeah, i think i see what you mean in the html  \njstoldt - (13:12): but to be honest, i don't think it's much of a bother  \njstoldt - (13:12): only a few extra bytes being transmitted  \nlucaa - (13:12): e.g. if you write  \nlucaa - (13:12): {{container justify=\"true\" layoutStyle=\"columns\"}}  \nlucaa - (13:12): (((content1)))  \nlucaa - (13:12): (%class=\"myclass\"%)(((content2)))  \nlucaa - (13:12): {{/container}}  \nlucaa - (13:12): the class will be there  \njstoldt - (13:12): mhmm  \njstoldt - (13:13): oh well, it works now, thanks for that!  \nlucaa - (13:14): jstoldt: actually I can fix that style thing easily for the container, I will  \njstoldt - (13:14): cool  \nvmassol - (13:33): jvelociter: wdyt about the idea I've put in the sheet which is to include installation instructions by default for the type + extra installations if they exist:  \nvmassol - (13:33): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= Installation Instructions =  \nvmassol - (13:33): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{include document=\"ExtensionCode.InstallationInstructionsFor${type}\"/}}  \nvmassol - (13:33): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#set($extraInstallation = $doc.getValue(\"installation\"))  \nvmassol - (13:33): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#if ($!extraInstallation != \"\")  \nvmassol - (13:33): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$extraInstallation  \nvmassol - (13:33): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#end  \njvelociter - (13:39): vmassol: let me see the code, I'm not getting it  \njvelociter - (13:39): ah yes that's cool  \njvelociter - (13:40): going to eat  \njvelociter - (13:40): BRB  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 13:47  \nvmassol - (14:01): jvelociter: I think I'm ready with the first version of the sheet to give a try to your script.
