Firefox browser?  \nmfong - (06:44): yes, but I've also tested on Chrome and IE7  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:45): Ok. What is the version of xwiki?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:45): Bottom of the page.  \nmfong - (06:46): 2.3.1.29118  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:46): Ok. looking...  \nmfong - (06:46): if i go to \"edit -> inline form\" the fields show, but it breaks other parts of the page and there's a bunch of syntax on the page too...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:49): Hmm, don't see any changes (bug fixes) since then. Explain how you add users?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:50): Upper left corner -> XWiki -> Administor wiki -> users?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:50): Actually you would want to click the groups panel...  \nmfong - (06:52): I actually don't have those options. \u00a0I'm logged in as the Admin user. \u00a0Top Left -> Xwiki -> Administer Wiki -> Groups -> XwikiAdminGroup  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:52): So you click on the Link that says XWikiAdminGroup?  \nmfong - (06:52): Yup  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:53): Ahh, try clicking the pencel icon instead.  \nmfong - (06:54): ah, \u00a0thanks. \u00a0\u00a0I thought I did that for some reason...  \nbbc581 joined #xwiki at 06:54  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:55): I just tried what you had done, that ought to work as well.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (06:56): Click XWikiAdminGroup then click edit... I see a page where I can add users.  \nmfong - (06:59): I tried that, but I see \"Member\" with a text field below, and the macro that says, \"The environment prevents the table to load data.\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:00): Hmm. That is not good. Usually that means javascript is turned off but that can't be your case.  \nmfong - (07:00): hrm, i just updated it to update 20..for java x64 \u00a0should that be ok?  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 07:01  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:01): Java x64 should have no effect.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:02): You see: \"Add user to group:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ [Add]\" \u00a0?  \nDenis1 left at 07:02 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nmfong - (07:04): after clicking \"edit\"? \u00a0no - it brings me to the wsiwyg editor.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:04): I see. If you edit the url to say /inline/ instead of /edit/ does it fix the problem?  \nmfong - (07:05): I can see the fields - but the ADD buttons don't work anymore, and I have java text on the page:  \nmfong - (07:05): <script type=\"text/javascript\"> // <![CDATA[ window.addNewMember = function(uorg, name) { //url = adduorg if(name) { var url = \"/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiAdminGroup\" + \"?xpage=adduorg\" + \"&\" + \"uorg=\" + uorg + \"&\" + \"name=\" + name; new Ajax.Request(url, { method: 'get', onSuccess: function(transport) { $('userSuggest').value = \"\"; $('groupSuggest').value = \"\"; var nr = parseInt(transport.responseText); if(nr == 0) $('errMsg').innerHTML  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:07): Hmm. I have just tested it on the trunk and it seems to be fixed.  \nDenis joined #xwiki at 07:08  \nmfong - (07:11): should I reinstall or check a setting somewhere?  \nvmassol1 joined #xwiki at 07:14  \nvmassol left at 07:16 (Ping timeout: 248 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:16): Starting 2.3 to see if I can reproduce...  \nmfong - (07:20): thanks.  \nvmassol1 left at 07:20 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:23): Works in XWiki Enterprise 2.3.28602  \nmfong - (07:28): ok. \u00a0well, i'll do some more testing. \u00a0\u00a0I'll try installing to a linux sever next. \u00a0\u00a0thanks for your time Caleb.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:29): No problem. You might try installing 2.4M1. I think that problem has since been sorted out.  \nmfong - (07:30): sounds good. \u00a0I like the look and feel of xwiki. \u00a0The wsiwyg is the best one I've found so far in a wiki.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (07:32): Cool :) \u00a0I just noticed there was a change in your timeframe, you might be able to fix simply by upgrading (or downgrading) the xar file.  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 07:56  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 08:06  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 08:15  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 08:34  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 08:34  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 08:34  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 08:40  \nmfong left at 08:57 (Quit: Page closed  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 09:05  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 09:11  \nvmassol1 joined #xwiki at 09:13  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 09:14  \nvmassol left at 09:14 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nmariusbutuc joined #xwiki at 09:32  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 09:33  \ntemporalfox left at 09:44 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \ntemporalfox joined #xwiki at 09:44  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 09:46  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 09:52  \nbblfish left at 09:52 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \nvmassol1 left at 09:54 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 09:55  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 10:12  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 10:14  \narkub joined #xwiki at 10:18  \nsburjan - (10:19): hello.  \nsburjan - (10:22): If I use Toucan, and I'd like to use another color theme, I get an some HTML macro error. (i'll create an issue for that)  \nsburjan - (10:22): my question is : if these color themes are incompatible/do not work with toucan, shouldn't there be a warning when trying to set one using toucan ?  \nsburjan - (10:23): or even better, not to apprea in the color theme dropdown ? (I guess this is a littlebit harder to achieve)  \nsburjan - (10:23): \\*appear  \nevalica - (10:24): Toucan is less influenced by ColorThemes than Colibri - you see the colors set, just on the components that implements the CT, no matter of the skin used  \nevalica - (10:26): I don't get any HTML macro error - so before you make an issue - be sure on what version of XE you are testing  \nevalica - (10:26): and what changes you done to it  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:28  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:34  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 10:35  \nsburjan - (10:36): using 2.4 M1  \nsburjan - (10:40): it works if you change it from the Administration->Presentation  \nsburjan - (10:40): iI get HTML macro error If I cant to change the theme from the Color Themes space  \nsburjan - (10:40): \\*want  \nsburjan - (10:41): evalica : can you confirm ?  \nsilviar - (10:41): Here's the error http://pastebin.com/wzWmCX8d  \nevalica - (10:41): I tested too on 2.4-milestone-1: changed the skin to toucan - changed the colortheme - no problem  \njvdrean1 joined #xwiki at 10:42  \njvdrean left at 10:42 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nevalica - (10:42): this is a rendering error, not a colortheme one  \nsburjan - (10:43): evalica : and did the color theme changed on toucan ?  \nevalica - (10:43): yes  \nsilviar - (10:43): note that the different theme is set; it doesn't affect the showing up of the new theme  \nevalica - (10:43): you can observer this by looking at the table header color... or at links on hover state, etc  \nsilviar - (10:49): to reproduce the above error go to the \"Color Themes\" space, click \"use this theme\" for any theme; under the \"info\" macro you will see the error  \nsilviar - (10:49): sburjan is filling a bug for it  \narkub left at 11:09 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nsilviar left at 11:19 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \narkub joined #xwiki at 11:20  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 11:23  \nmflorea left at 11:52 (Quit: Leaving.  \narkub left at 12:09 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nflorinciu left at 12:20 (Quit: Leaving.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 12:27  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 12:33  \njvdrean1 left at 12:33 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 12:33  \nvmassol1 joined #xwiki at 13:05  \nvmassol left at 13:05 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:33): Why do we have an id macro if we can just use 2.0 syntax (%id=\"some-id\"%)?  \n\n"}
