 \n12:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no that seems correct but the result I can see does not seems to have been built with that7  \n12:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0just disconnected, maybe I did make a mistake, the bash\\_history will tell  \n12:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I'm trying a build of the whole XE with \"mvn clean install -Pci,hsqldb,jetty -DskipTests\"  \n12:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe there is some weird thing happening when building the whole thing instead of just the installer  \n12:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0just double checked and I followed my guide pretty well  \n12:29\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I wouldn't have been surprised had I pasted the line from manager but it doesn't look like that happened  \n12:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0nop  \n12:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all I can say is that installer is good when hsqldb profile is enabled and to get when we have in 3.1 build I need to build without it  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/when/what/  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0will see what happen with the whole XE build  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0running  \n12:30\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:31\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n12:33\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys should I ask for a revert for xeclipse.myxwiki.org ?

is from a JIRA update or is a rights problem?  \n12:53\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0or maybe is because of the transfer of the issue into Platform - and closing the components projects  \n12:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: I maybe found something, checking  \n12:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0you can go ahead and look at the bash\\_history, I ran exactly what I had in my notes (a small wonder)  \n12:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep that's it  \n12:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is a maven plugin id issue which makes it take sometime one configuration sometime the other  \n12:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0fiwing that  \n12:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0fixing  \n13:00\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0would you mind sending some more info about the exact problem/fix to the list?
