 \n11:06\u00a0<tutankamun>\u00a0has quit  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's actually a requirement of maven central  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: for ex http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons-component-api/5.4.1/  \n11:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mmm  \n11:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0than these are not seen by dash, which is curious, since it gets those of others  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually we even fail the build if those are not produced ;)  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we have an enforcer rule for that)  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n11:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0that's great, but there should be something missing since it does not found the doc.  \n11:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0look at http://search.maven.org/  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what should I look for?  \n11:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0search \"xwiki\" for our modules, it does not show any link to the javadoc.jar, like it does for \"bcprov\"  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's normal :)  \n11:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0why ?  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's secondary artifacts with qualifiers  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you have a link for bcprov?  \n11:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0search bcprov !  \n11:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you will see soe module with javadoc.jar links  \n11:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0s/soe/some  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same for xwiki  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just search for \"xwiki\"  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C2%7Cxwiki  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again we do provide javadoc jars....  \n11:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0great, it is just lost in the numerous package we have  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pom modues don't produce javadoc obviously ....  \n11:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0obviously  \n11:19\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0that have fool me since the UI of Dash does not show larger names and package type  \n11:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I should have been more careful on search.maven.org however  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so it works fine in dash?  \n11:23\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n11:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yep, it works  \n11:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you just have to find your way properly in the long list of modules, and get those that have a javadoc  \n11:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for the api ones, it is quite easy, for others it is a bit more troublesome  \n11:26\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: would be nice if you could publish an official xwiki docset for dash ;)  \n11:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I had made some research to publish the SRD, but the way it build was so broken that I have leave this for latter  \n11:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:35\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0As soon as I have some time, I find the idea great, I will surely look at it again  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:36\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I have the feeling that improving our docs is a great way to improve adoption, currently we probably loose many potential user simply because they do not find what they look for quickly enought  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for devs sure, for users probably not  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if you're talking about javadocs)  \n11:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n11:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0devs introduce XWiki to new users, do not forget that. And more the SRD than the full framework javadoc would nice to have, since scripting is not exclusive to devs. I compare that to the success of PHP, it have been widely adopted by casual scripters first.  \n11:52\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0(and I was talking in general)  \n11:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0BTW, we rarely document packages, which make the overview page of our javadoc not very nice.  \n11:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0from 1.5, there is two way to do so (.html or .java), wouldn't it be nice to choose a way and use it more consistently ? a Documentation day would help fixing the existing.  \n12:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0according to jse documentation, it seems the new package-info.java way is recommended. I personally find it more easy to use as well.  \n12:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0where in wysiwyg editor is paste event handled?  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: hi  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: do you think you could add yourself to https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=210331808187331529022.0004f02bd076d94db85c6&msa=0&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=15.33959,-25.897332&spn=73.477934,106.974356&source=embed&dg=feature ?

OTOH I'm not going to be very available for conferences in that area...  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah you should probably put where you live  \n12:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm logged in but I can't find the place where I should click to add myself #usabilityfail  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep it's hard to use  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you need to click \"modify\" or \"update\" first  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you can place a flag  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or modify an existing one)  \n12:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh, right click to add a flag  \n12:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0done  \n12:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"5; url=&#39;https://maps.google.com/maps \u00a0\u00a0#google #security #goodjob  \n12:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: \u00a0there is a PasteManager.java \u00a0in the xwiki-platform-wysiwyg-client \u00a0module ... not sure if this is what you are looking for, however  \n12:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: i'm not sure if thats it... i need to add functionality to allow copy-paste images in wysiwyg... currently it works for copy-pasted images from websites (adds image tag with url), not for raw data (which could be used as data:mime/type;base64,base64binarydata)  \n12:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: ah, ok, I guess then all you need to do is to wait for the next release  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-278 )  \n12:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, I forgot it is already released, me \u00a0lagging behind ...  \n12:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep... but since i need to demonstrate usability of xwiki in production use, i need to make it work asap :)  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's released already been released for a while  \n12:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can use 5.4.2 for example  \n12:43\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep, trying now  \n12:46\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n12:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0[[image...]] works, but i need to modify event paste handler to use it dynamically (i.e. base64encode(event.clipboardData.getData)), but i cannot find the code that does it (tinymce has afaik the only piece of code that uses clipboardData if i grep resources folder, but something else has to do that, because if you paste image that has URL, [[image]] tag is created)  \n12:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n12:55\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, it should work with IE and stuff, too ...  \n12:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the problem for \"after been packaged\" additions with the GWT editor is that it uses java code which then gets translated to javascript  \n12:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so you are expected to write java classes which then gets translated to javascript, instead of writing javascript directly and hook it up in the page loader  \n12:58\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep, getting clipboard data from paste event works from IE6 and works in every major web browser (getting clipboard data directly works only in IE)  \n12:58\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0i'm familiar with GWT, i'm just not sure where should i modify it (since i don't see any clipboard data handling or diversing by clipboard content)  \n12:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0in theory you can ttry to register an event listener to the \"onPaste\" event anyway, but I guess that does not suooprt transforining the content of the clipboard ...  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well,I think it is something analogous to xwiki-platform-wysiwyg/xwiki-platform-wysiwyg-client/src/main/java/org/xwiki/gwt/wysiwyg/client/plugin/importer/PasteManager.java  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(here interrupt)  \n13:02\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep... it looks like cleanPasteContent could do it (onAfterPaste could be called after paste event occurs)  \n13:07\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0but it looks like it is only capable of handling text data (i don't see any method in gwt which could be used for obtained binary data from clipboard), so i guess creating another paste event listener is my only possibility  \n13:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:11\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:41\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n14:53\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:14\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:18\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0hello, I have a question.

The database is empty so there's no use to login. What did you do exactly?  \n15:49\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0ok, after I started the xwiki, checked the DB and saw there was the schema, so I tried to log in to the web gui and i got this empty page  \n15:49\u00a0<juannicolas>\u00a0\"Notice The requested document could not be found.
