 \n15:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0please don't do that or then clean the agent if you do  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(killed from jenkins UI that is)  \n15:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep I confirm after each build of platform 6.1 there is a jetty/hsqldb instance that keeps running  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's near the end  \n16:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seems to be xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-wiki/xwiki-platform-wiki-test/xwiki-platform-wiki-test-tests/target/xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least in that case  \n16:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a simple kill <pid> works instantly on it so it mean there is an issue in this project that makes not not try to stop it at all  \n16:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: maybe when the test is over the instance is still busy indexing any freshly created test wiki? I got the impression jetty ignored the first attempt to stop it in some cases, but stops successfully the second time  \n16:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0just a wild idea of mine, however ....  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:38\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0andreeapopescu: gi  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what does \"the highest version of XWiki\" means on http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/ExtensionStatus ?  \n16:39\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0vamassol: hi  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you make it more clear what it's about?  \n16:39\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0vmassol: hi  \n16:39\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0yes, of course  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0highestt version of XWiki the extension has been tested with?  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0highest version of Xwiki the extensions is working with?  \n16:40\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0exactly  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly for which one? ;)  \n16:40\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0I modified in the table  \n16:40\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0yes  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the table has not been changed  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it still says \"the highest version of xwiki\"  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which doesn't mean much as explained above  \n16:41\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0done  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so Selenium app for ex  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't work with 6.1?  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(first one)  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it says 6.0.1  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you really sure?  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm quite convinced it would work with 6.1  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same for a lot of others  \n16:43\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0yeah, but.. when I tested the app.. 6.1 wasn\u2019t  \n16:43\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0the apps\\*  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a06.1M1, 6.1M2, 6.1RC1  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when 6.1 is out  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your table will all be wrong  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you cannot do it like this...  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also I think it would be nice to put some text on this page to explain what you're doing  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not clear what 'extension status' means for me  \n16:43\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0ok..
