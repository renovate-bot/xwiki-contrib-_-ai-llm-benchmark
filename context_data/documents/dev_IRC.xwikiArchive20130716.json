But the result is the same.  \n13:42\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0the extraction should be \"automatically\" .... it must be something different  \n13:42\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:15\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0btw is there any \"root cause\" to the \"solr initialization fails\" error below ?  \n15:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0@camil7, thank you, I had system property that was defining a wrong solr path.  \n15:37\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, phew  \n15:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Write mails to mailing list and abort them seeing your error. This is such a good pedagogic practice!  \n16:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Hey team, does anyone know if the extension repository is indeed dad?  \n16:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0(dead)  \n16:33\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0it is currently down due to server maintenance  \n16:33\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0should be back in a minute ... or two ...  \n16:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0thx  \n16:33\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0actually it is back now for me  \n16:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0and it just installed.
