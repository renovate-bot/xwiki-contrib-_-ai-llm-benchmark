So I'm trying this:  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#if (\"$!doc.getValue('title')\" != '')$doc.getValue('title')#else${doc.getPlainTitle()}#end  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is in a sheet page  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however if the title xproperty is not set it displays the name of the sheet and not the doc on which it applies  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think this is because of the default sheet fallback mechanism but I'm not sure how to make it work properly  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: any idea?  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I want the page name but I don't want \"WebHome\" :)  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I want the algo that says page name and if page is webhome then parent space name  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll use the following for now but it assumes pages are non terminal (which is ok but I was wondering if I could do better):  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#if (\"$!doc.getValue('title')\" != '')$doc.getValue('title')#else${doc.documentReference.parent.name}#end  \n11:32\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: where did you put this code? calling getPlainTitle() in the title leads to an infinite loop  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it was working :)  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(except displaying the sheet page name)  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I was putting it in the title of the sheet page  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we have a protection ;)  \n11:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no  \n11:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you didn't try with with an actual instance that had value for title  \n11:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tried with both  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was working fine when there was a title set  \n11:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0empty value for title I mean  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with empty it was displaying the sheet name  \n11:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in the app instance  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway don't spend too much time on this, I'm creating nested pages so my \"hack\" is enough for now  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm just curious if there's a solution  \n11:50\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:52\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: you're logged as chocolade :)  \n12:40\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n12:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:55\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0has quit  \n13:09\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:09\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n13:09\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:18\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n14:33\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done for 8.3M1 and 8.3M2 release notes with the new system  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting converting 8.3RC1 now  \n14:46\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done for RC1 too  \n14:54\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:55\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n15:38\u00a0<ekarlso\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: if you don't mind, I'm going to take care of http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10375 in order to fix http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13256  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes I'm sorry about that mflorea, I was supposed to fix this. I have some half-finished work locally but you're probably better off starting from scratch I guess. Ping me if you need help/explanations about what exists  \n17:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: most of the stuff I need already exists, but I will create a new module xwiki-platform-resource-temporary because I need some deps for the temp resource handler (e.g the container) and I'm not sure we need to add those to the resource-default module  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n17:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:36\u00a0<anticitizen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:44\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:50\u00a0<anticitizen>\u00a0has quit  \n21:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:24\u00a0<anticitizen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n23:54\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
