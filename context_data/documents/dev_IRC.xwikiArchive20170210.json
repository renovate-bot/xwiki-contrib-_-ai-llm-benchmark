(before a start writing raw queries).  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0KermitTheFragger: no, you will have to use queries  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by the way did you looked at https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/authenticator-saml ?  \n11:26\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0tmortagne: yes I did. I was planning to implement single logout  \n11:26\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0but OpenSAML is a behemoth...I did an implementation with it once. Its huge and its easy to make mistakes  \n11:27\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0OpenSAML is a really low level SAML implementation which exposes you to all the gory details of SAML  \n11:27\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0So i decided to do an implementation based upon OneLogin's SAML library: https://github.com/onelogin/java-saml  \n11:28\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0you can literally do with 4 lines for which you need like 60+ lines of low level SAML stuff in OpenSAML  \n11:28\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0configuration is also really easy via the onelogin.saml.properties file  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok, sounds good  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0might be a 2.0 for https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/authenticator-saml ;)  \n11:29\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0yeah i will release the source once It's done and cleaned it up a bit ;-)  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/authenticator-saml probably never been formely released  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just built when needed from what I remember  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that could be a 1.0 :)  \n11:31\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0yeah it looks okay but its certainly build to fit a very specific need of someone :-)  \n11:31\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0I thought about using OpenID but the single logout of OpenID with the hidden IFrame and stuf....I dunno....;-)  \n11:32\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0SAML allows the IDP to directly call the SP for a logout  \n11:32\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0and i'm shielded from the XML hell by OneLogin's library :-)  \n11:57\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:19\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:49\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0wooohooo it's alive!  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:50\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0now its time to do some clean up...  \n15:09\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0has quit  \n17:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:21\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, what do you think: I've put docker in the production section at http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Download/DownloadVersion/?projectVersion=8.4.4  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(rather than the demo section)  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should I switch?  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0docker can and is used in production  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it could fit in both categories  \n18:30\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:40\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:32\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:16\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
