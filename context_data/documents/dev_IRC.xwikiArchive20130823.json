Can I be sure from the web.xml (that is shipped with xwiki 3.5) that any request whose path starts with /xwiki/skins/ is served by the default servlet (which serves the matching file)?  \n16:25\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0I do not think so  \n17:04\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0the/xwiki/skin/ is dragged through the com.xpn.xwiki.web.SkinAction  \n17:04\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0you can see this in the WEB-INF/struts-config.xml  \n17:05\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0this does some \"magic\", e.g. serving attachments in the XWiki.DefaultSkin as if they are in the skins/<baseskin> directory  \n17:06\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, something loosely like that, I am no skin expert ...  \n17:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0thx @camil7.  \n17:42\u00a0<polx>\u00a0camil7: you sure that this is not /bin/skin?  \n17:43\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0no, not really ... I am no xwiki expert, just a user hanging out here  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:59\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0polx: ah, me bad, Struts stuff really applies to /bin/skin instead, so /skin should be served straight away  \n18:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:56\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Cool.
