I apologize for the previous one , I wrote it with some misunderstanding on mind.  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: according to the stack trace at http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/lastCompletedBuild/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/testReport/org.xwiki.test.ui/LanguageTest/testHeaderCorrectLanguage/  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problme is in org.xwiki.administration.test.po.LocalizationAdministrationSectionPage.setDefaultLanguage(LocalizationAdministrationSectionPage.java:63)  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I doubt that this has antying to do with the Query Manager  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the language that is being set is \"en\"  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's available in the language list in the screenshot (even selected)  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the error is \"Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with\"  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue is that the select covers the input  \n14:10\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we start to type keys in the input  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and after the first key the select opens and cover the input field  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus the next letter cannot be typed  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no the input is not a text input anymore  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the reason is not this one  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in any case it's not related to my changes I'm pretty sure  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I don't see how it can work  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I try manually to enter \"en\" it doesn't select English  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the tests uses: setLanguageSettings(false, \"en\");  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I can reproduce the issue  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the input disappears when you reduce the size of teh screen vertically  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0!!  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for example by opening the dev tool on chrome)  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems boostrap is buggy  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it works again if you scroll the viewport down a but  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*bit  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so definitely not related to my changes  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe more related to the viewport screen available that could have been changed by mflorea1 menu changes?  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in any case it seems a bootstrap bug but we may need a workaround for our tests or upgrade bootstrap if it's fixed  \n15:46\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:11\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0something that could interest you: https://github.com/timgifford/maven-buildtime-extension  \n16:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks interresting indeed  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did not know about Maven's EventSpy  \n16:50\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:42\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:26\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:33\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:53\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n20:38\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:42\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:49\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:53\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:25\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n22:18\u00a0<keithy>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n22:55\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n22:56\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:56\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n23:00\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:13\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit\n"}
