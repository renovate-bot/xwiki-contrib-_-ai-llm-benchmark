I was thinking to basically put the 2 \"use\" methods in an interface (SkinExtension), and then implement it with the ssx, ssfx, ssrx, jsx, jsrx, jsfx hints  \n17:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(I would do it, I was only wondering what do you think about this approach)  \n18:01\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:54\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:54\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:54\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:53\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n21:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:06\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:09\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:09\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n23:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:43\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
