Please have a look at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/Guidelines  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you're ok to be the RM for 8.0 final? See http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleasePlans/ I'm planning to release 6.4.8 Thursday on my side.  \n09:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I'll see with thomas if we can exchange maybe  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually, that reminds me that for the next release dates, i need to propose release dates that don't fall on Friday or Monday since you're off Fridays. And Thursday is also dangerous since it can mean postponing till Monday. So basically Tuesday or Wednesday. I think I'll propose Tuesday. WDYT?  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll let you talk to Thomas  \n09:37\u00a0<flook>\u00a0Enygma`, I went through that link  \n09:37\u00a0<flook>\u00a0should I build xwiki ?  \n09:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0flook: that link says \"Usually, you don`t need to know how to build XWiki itself. What is more \u00a0important is to understand is how to build applications/extensions on top of XWiki.\"  \n09:38\u00a0<flook>\u00a0are there any bugs related to this?  \n09:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0see the section below, \"Increasing your chances of being accepted as a student\"  \n09:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you need to get up to speed with XWiki, what it does and now to develop on top of the XWiki platform  \n09:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and then find an easy bug that you can fix by sending a Pull Request  \n09:40\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n09:42\u00a0<flook>\u00a0Enygma`, to fix a bug I'll have to set up the dev env.  \n09:42\u00a0<flook>\u00a0that means I'll have to build xwiki  \n09:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0not necessarily  \n09:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0XWiki is a platform + applications  \n09:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it can be a bug inside an application (with code inside wiki pages)  \n09:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0or it can be a bug in the platform (which can be java code, velocity templates, javascript)  \n09:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you can work in a local instance that you can install for yourself  \n09:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0also, you don`t need to run the entire XWiki build, which can take up to several hours  \n09:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but you can build a specific module which you are working on  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it could be a good step to know how to setup a dev env IMO. And for that you can follow http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SourceRepository and http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Building  \n09:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that could take 30 sec to 5 minutes  \n09:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0as I`ve said, only partially. Don`t try to build the entire XWiki build since it would be a waste of time :)  \n09:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0also, the blame project is an UI project so you need to work with velocity + HTML + CSS + JS  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is explained on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Building btw  \n09:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0flook: the bottom line is that your dev environment can be reduced to a running XWiki instance + a web browser  \n09:50\u00a0<flook>\u00a0Enygma`, thanks  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's because we code UIs in wiki pages and the blame API - written in Java - already exists. The goal of this project is to write the UI, aFAIK)  \n09:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yep  \n09:52\u00a0<flook>\u00a0Enygma`, do I need to know JAVA for this one  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0flook: see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/BlameView  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a developer profile section  \n09:54\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0ok  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the answer is no, could be a plus if there's a need to modify the java api  \n09:54\u00a0<flook>\u00a0thanks  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also a plus to debug when there are issues  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but otherwise no  \n09:54\u00a0<pakhandibaba>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n09:57\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Good morning!  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good morning  \n10:16\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0I am new with Xwiki, I happen to be trying the JAR file version for fast testing.  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n10:16\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Yes, looks great!  \n10:17\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0When I want to include a page or space on the workspace through one of the include plugins, the page does not get displayed...  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{include reference:\"...\"/}}  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:17\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0The root of this page is Wiki.Gmail  \n10:17\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Well, I just added the plugin and then I added the root of the page as Wiki.Gmail  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what plugin?  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have a link?  \n10:18\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0plugin = extension  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what extension?  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Sorry for my wrong vocabulary, just learning about it :)  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no need for a extension for include  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why I'm asking  \n10:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0I tried with Include Macro  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0includes must be done with the include macro ({{include}}) or the display macro ({{display}})  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to provide a valid reference to the page to include  \n10:22\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0I thought I was doing that, but I am wondering how can I find the valid reference to be completely sure  \n10:23\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0I have searched the from the root and saw all spaces. Compared that page with another page -> the welcome wiki included in the workspace  \n10:23\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0and for the welcome wiki it did worked again, but for the new wiki I created it didn't work  \n10:26\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0@vmassol do you know if it could be related to something like rights management?  \n10:42\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:43\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Good morning! I've closed by mistake the tab and failed to see previous response  \n10:45\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I have something I want to clarify. I am trying to make work the include macro. But I don't know what I am doing wrong. I take as an example the Welcome Wiki which has in the include macro Reference: Main.Welcome. Nevertheless, it appears to be on the Pages Macro on Home-> Welcome to your wiki. I can see that the url that it points out is Home/Welcome...  \n10:46\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Now, if I take another example from the same default Pages macro included in the workspace. Let's say Blog->First blog post, it points out to URL /Blog/BlogIntroduction  \n10:46\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0If I try to include in an include macro the reference as Blog.BlogIntroduction it does not work  \n10:47\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I guess first of all, my question would be. How do I find out the reference from pages or spaces so I can include them in macros and make them display?  \n10:47\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hi guest, what is your URL on the page where you want include another page?  \n10:47\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0could you give both URL?  \n10:48\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0you can remove server name of course  \n10:49\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Yes of course, I am just trying to make this macro work  \n10:49\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0So I take the default pages that come with Xwiki  \n10:49\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a08080/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/BlogIntroduction  \n10:49\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Ok, let me find another one  \n10:49\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Sandbox/TestPage1  \n10:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0This page is the page you want include?  \n10:50\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Ok, that one works out like Sandbox.TestPage1  \n10:50\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I was trying to test but I see that this one works as well  \n10:50\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0are the references then taken out from the URL?  \n10:51\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Blog contains \"special\" page because it is an application  \n10:51\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0If you edit source of a blog entry you can see it  \n10:52\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0it seem empty (you must edit a blog entry with object editor)  \n10:52\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0For example, I now created a page called \"Hola\" behind the XWiki page... The URL of this new page is :8080/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Hola/  \n10:53\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0and if I try to include XWiki.Hola it doesn't work  \n10:53\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0the XWiki.Hola has text inside the page to be displayed in the macro and it's not display  \n10:53\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n10:53\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I am logged in as Administrator  \n10:54\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Do you edit code include or use macro from editor tool?  \n10:55\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0What is the URL of main page you want display include one?  \n10:55\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0:8080/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Hola/  \n10:56\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0this one is the page you want include  \n10:56\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I have added an include macro on :8080/xwiki/bin/view/Dashboard/, I want on that include macro to display a new wiki page I have created which is under :8080/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Hola/  \n10:56\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok  \n10:58\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0{{include reference=\"XWiki.Hola\"/}} or {{include reference=\"xwiki:XWiki.Hola\"/}} doesn't work?  \n10:58\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I was using the edit pencil on top of the macro instead of that  \n10:58\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Shall I write that on the Reference on the same UI?  \n10:59\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Edit /xwiki/bin/view/Dashboard/ with wiki editor to paste/check include code  \n11:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0for the dashboard it is probably in the object editor, in one of the \u00a0XWiki.GadgetClass objects  \n11:04\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok thxs for your help :)  \n11:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the \"reference\" field should contain \"XWiki.Hola\" , as Pbas said. Then it should work  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it won't  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need XWiki.Hola.WebHome  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since your URL is :8080/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Hola/  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it were XWiki/Hola then XWiki.Hola would be good  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8: we're missing shortcuts for nested pages in macro parameters ATM  \n11:06\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0it should be edited with the wiki editor inside the macro?  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13066  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8: you can use the wiki editor or the wysiwyg editor, as you wish  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was just giving you the proper reference to use  \n11:07\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I will try with the WebHome, what is the reason of this?  \n11:07\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0It works with the WebHome!  \n11:07\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0:)  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you're up for reasing a bit: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/ContentOrganization#HHistory ;)  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*reading  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in short:  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're transitioning to Nested Pages  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie ability to create children pages  \n11:08\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Of course I am up, I want to understand why this is happening because in other cases it might be different and I will need to see how that is in order to include the appropiate reference  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and this is one of the few remaining things to iron out  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0things = ability to hide WebHome  \n11:09\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0so is soon to be changed ?  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using WebHome will always work  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we want to make it simpler  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and automaitcally add the WebHome part for you  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so in short:  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- our internal model supports only pages (hence the WebHome part)  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- our UI is now hiding the concept of spaces and it simulates only pages  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a bit difficult to understand  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should read that link and come back with questions after :)  \n11:10\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0I will read it, thanks in advance Vincent :)  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"our internal model supports only pages \" not correct actually. What I meant is that our internal model suports Nested Spaces + Pages, ie a reference always ends with a page name  \n11:12\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Which at the moment seems to be WebHome I guess  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you create a page in the UI  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we do is create a space of that name  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and inside that space a page named WebHome  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this gives the ability to create other pages inside that \"space\"  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which as a user you see as the ability to create Nested Pages  \n11:13\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Perfect!
