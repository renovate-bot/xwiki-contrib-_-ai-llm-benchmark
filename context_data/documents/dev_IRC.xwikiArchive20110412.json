How do you plan to store the ozone widgets in the content?  \n15:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: I think you can remove tools repositories from github now  \n15:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0K  \n15:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: Do you want admin rights?  \n15:09\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: the plan at least at first was to wrap it into a macro, whcih would store the paramaters used for that particular instance of the ozone widget. \u00a0The macro would reach out and touch another webservice to retraive the data specific to that instance.  \n15:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: sure, does that mean \"please do the remove\" ? :D  \n15:09\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0it seemed like the path of least restance at that point.. but I am not sure that it is the best way  \n15:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: are you using XE 3.0?  \n15:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: Added, I'm doing the remove  \n15:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok thanks  \n15:11\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: currently we baselined on 2.7, but we can make the shift if it provides better soulution, or streamlined  \n15:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: One thing we don't have is xem-web-debug-eclipse  \n15:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0What do you want to do with it?  \n15:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I have it locally in a repo, if you're interested  \n15:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's in platform AFAIK  \n15:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0In 2.7 a button HTML element is used to protect the macro output, while in 3.0 a CSS class determines the behavior. One option would be to write a editor plugin (easier in 3.0 since the plugin api was moved in a separate maven module) that detects the macros that wrap ozone widgets and overwrites the macro behavior. But I'm not sure what you mean by \"live\", editing in place? Note that in this case you would be editing the output so you need a   \n15:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it would probably make more sense in its own repository i guess  \n15:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(since it's not supposed to be built it's not very clean as platform submodule)  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: WDYT ?  \n15:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't think it is in platform at the moment  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well i can see it :)  \n15:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's not anywhere, except on my computer  \n15:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Where?  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/master/xwiki-platform-tools/xem-web-debug-eclipse  \n15:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Oh, right  \n15:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0:D  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0:)  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0my +1 for alone in it's own repository on https://github.com/xwiki/  \n15:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+1  \n15:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: currently the source is saved in an XML comment. So when you edit a macro the XML comment is updated. This body of this XML comment has a specific syntax. If you want to edit live then there are two cases: (1) the client knows how to update the UI --> in this case you have to update the XML comment before the save action. (2) the client doesn't know how to update the content, so it needs to make requests to the server.

(then I will reafactor it with proper git links)  \n15:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: K  \n15:20\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0mflorea: afaik 512 chars  \n15:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0my client doesn't complain  \n15:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: What should it be called? xem-web-debug-eclipse?  \n15:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: currently the source is saved in an XML comment. So when you edit a macro the XML comment is updated. This body of this XML comment has a specific syntax. If you want to edit live then there are two cases:  \n15:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0(1) the client knows how to update the UI --> in this case you have to update the XML comment before the save action. (2) the client doesn't know how to update the content, so it needs to make requests to the server. In this case you need to update the XML for each request.  \n15:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0In 2.7 a button HTML element is used to protect the macro output, while in 3.0 a CSS class determines the behavior. One option would be to write a editor plugin (easier in 3.0 since the plugin api was moved in a separate maven module)  \n15:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0that detects the macros that wrap ozone widgets and overwrites the macro behavior. But I'm not sure what you mean by \"live\", editing in place? Note that in this case you would be editing the output so you need a way to update the source from the modified output.  \n15:24\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: How about xwiki-debug-eclipse or xwiki-eclipse-debug  \n15:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0read the last 2 messages and then the first 2  \n15:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since XEM is kind of the topmost project, and the others (watch, workspaces) are almost dead, it doesn't make sense to specify xem in the name  \n15:26\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: okay, I am following so far, since the 3.0 seems like a better decoupled solution. \u00a0to place an ozone widget, that only is editable at page render. \u00a0Where is the editor plugin, and is it a gwt, or are you referenceing this site : http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/WYSIWYG+Editor+Module  \n15:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: Pushed to https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-debug-eclipse  \n15:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: yep xwiki-debug-eclipse is fine  \n15:28\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: wdym by \"editable at page render\"?  \n15:29\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: so if I have a map ozone widget, the ozone widget is interactble at page render.. and we were thinking about storing the content of that widget (the data set used to produce that instance) in another store, though we have not decided on a solution for that yet  \n15:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: I think the repositories are almost final (except the debug and the xarhandler)  \n15:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0WDYT?  \n15:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: yep, looks good  \n15:30\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Can we go on and update http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SourceRepository ?  \n15:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0+1  \n15:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: page render = when you view the page or when you edit the page, or both?  \n15:31\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: view. \u00a0But the ultimate goal if we can pull it off is also at edit.  \n15:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually I'd rather take care of GSoC today, I wonder if someone else can update that...  \n15:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: finishing with xwiki-debug-eclipse and I'm looking at it  \n15:34\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:34\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: hmm there is still contrib stuff to put on github, isn't it ?  \n15:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but in another organisation  \n15:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Anything I wrote that's in contrib can be put in /dev/null, If I want to play with it I'll get it from history and put it in my namespace.  \n15:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: it depends if the user interaction produces changes inside XWiki (e.g. page content is changed or some xobjects are updated) or not. If the state of the ozone widget is stored outside XWiki then simply writing a macro for XE 3.0 should be enough, because in 3.0 you can interact with macro output. If the state is stored inside XWiki then it's tricky to do it in view mode.  \n15:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0In edit mode you can write a plugin for the wysiwyg editor that listens to the user interaction and updates the macro source (the XML metadata comment)  \n15:40\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: so it really comes down to its wasy to do one or the other but not both? \u00a0while I am not a fan of duplicating content in mulitple places, could their be a routine that while in edit mode, you build the lets call it a record set, to push out to the external location that controls that specific page on view  \n15:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n15:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: you could, checkout the editor code and look at the existing plugins (git: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/xwiki-web-3.0/xwiki-platform-web svn: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/web/tags/xwiki-web-3.0/ )  \n15:48\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: thanks for the point to the code, which are the existing plugins, and do I have to extend, or simply implement the plugin api  \n15:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you can either implement an interface or extends one of the helper classes. You can find existing plugin in wysiwyg-client module. Note that plugin are not picked automatically, so you have to \"register\" their class in WysiwygEditorFactory class. Check the existing plugins and you'll see  \n15:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0evalica: Do you remember where is the document describing standard classnames, like withTip and suggestDocuments?  \n15:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0evalica: Found it, nevermind  \n15:55\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: okay I am going to arvhive this and poke around a bit thanks for your help, and I am sure I will be poking you sooner or later in the near future.. again thank you for your help . \u00a0Side question, I know you used GWT to help build this, do I need anything specific to build an extension, eg have GWT, and do anything special?  \n15:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you just need java and maven.
