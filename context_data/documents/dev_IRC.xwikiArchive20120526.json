Would xwiki be suitable for creating good looking documentation in PDF form? (Not like print screens style...)  \n21:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi ssavi  \n21:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'll answer ries first  \n21:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi ries  \n21:18\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0Yeah sure  \n21:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, it depends on how much time do you have to invest in customizing the PDF export  \n21:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You can check how a normal PDF looks like, for example try http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting?xpage=pdfoptions  \n21:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0My answer would be Yes, XWiki is very good for writing documentation, but it might need some tweaking to get some really good looking PDFs  \n21:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HCustomizingthePDFexportLook26Feel describes in more detail how can you customize the PDF  \n21:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0ssavi: You modified AttachmentData for indexing the mimetype, right?  \n21:25\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0yep  \n21:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0There is already a test class for AttachmentData  \n21:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So you'll add a new method there  \n21:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In that method you'll call addDataToLuceneDocument, and then check if after that the lucene Document object has a field called \"mimetype\"  \n21:27\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I added these lines in the test class as it \u00a0was throwing some build errrors  \n21:27\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0Mock mockServletContext = mock(ServletContext.class);  \n21:27\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mockServletContext.stubs().method(\"getMimeType\").will(returnValue(\"default\"));  \n21:27\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0XWikiServletContext xwikiServletContext = new XWikiServletContext((ServletContext) mockServletContext.proxy());  \n21:27\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0getContext().setEngineContext(xwikiServletContext);  \n21:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep  \n21:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That's the right approach  \n21:28\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0.k thanks  \n21:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But you should be more specific, instead of returning \"default\" you should specify something like:  \n21:28\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: Currently for our open source project we are using mediawiki, but I am less than satisified by it\u2026 For work we where looking for a java based wiki and I was shoked to see how much xwiki was advanced  \n21:29\u00a0<ries>\u00a0So now I am temted to think to revisit the decission of using mediawiki  \n21:29\u00a0<ries>\u00a0the PDF looks already pretty nice  \n21:29\u00a0<ries>\u00a0and, I have no problem making changes to customize...  \n21:29\u00a0<ries>\u00a0We don't have much yet, but this is our current wiki : http://wiki.librecad.org/index.php/Main\\_Page  \n21:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0ssavi:  \n21:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mockServletContext.stubs().method(\"getMimeType\").with(eq(\"txt.txt\")).will(returnValue(\"text/plain\"));  \n21:34\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0sdumitriu: Ah.. I get that. Thanks a lot sergiu  \n21:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0ssavi: You're welcome  \n21:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I sent a reply to your API proposal  \n21:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0ries: Switching wikis is something that you should consider carefully together with the rest of your community  \n21:35\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: it's still a very young wiki...  \n21:36\u00a0<ries>\u00a0so, it's still a good time to switch  \n21:36\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's not as simple as \"the new wiki has more features\", since your users might have to learn a new wiki syntax, a new UI, and so on  \n21:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Although Mediawiki isn't as featured as other wikis, it's still the most popular one and thus it's the one that most people already know how to use  \n21:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I've seen mixed results with XWiki, some say it's very easy to use, but some (especially non technical people) say that it's a bit confusing  \n21:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I guess you won't have that many non-technical users, though  \n21:38\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I found it very hard to do anything really well on mediawiki\u2026 I come from a CMS space though and wiki's still look a bit odd to me.  \n21:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You should start with a parallel setup to let users see how they get along with XWiki for a few weeks  \n21:38\u00a0<ries>\u00a0However, when looked for my work for 'something' to document on, I found that xwiki was just much more advanced...  \n21:39\u00a0<ries>\u00a0for the next couple of week I am going to play with xwiki  \n21:40\u00a0<ries>\u00a0, to make the documentation I am currently making in pages and send around as PDF into xwiki  \n21:40\u00a0<ries>\u00a0See how that goes  \n21:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Don't hesitate to ask for help here  \n21:40\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I won't! That's why I was getting here yesterday  \n21:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, you have to find a time when some devs are online  \n21:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If nobody answers, try again later  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:43\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: yup\u2026. I ususally hang out a lot on IRC, our project is at #librecad  \n22:07\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I am following this guide : http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/ImportExport  \n22:07\u00a0<ries>\u00a0But after I uploaded th xae, I don't get thelist of available packages  \n22:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Did you click on the file name?  \n22:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0gtg, bbl  \n22:11\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: filename isn't even shown..  \n23:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
