I shall further research  \ncjdelisle - (20:31): Maybe they provide an api to access it but I know the code \\_can\\_ be protected from your script.  \nr4tune - (20:33): why do you want to know if someone is running firebug element inspector out of curiosity?  \nMartinCleaver left at 20:34 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \ndegro - (20:38): it is me who's running the firebug inspector.
