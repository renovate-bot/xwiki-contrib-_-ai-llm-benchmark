 \n03:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It only seems to work for subwikis.  \n03:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Often the main wiki will be made unavailable for security reasons.  \n03:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0!jira xwiki.home parameter  \n03:22\u00a0<roxxo>\u00a0has quit  \n03:27\u00a0<Pon>\u00a0if you want a bug report, I can file one for you ^^;  \n03:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I have a fix but it breaks 2 tests and I want to make sure it is safe.  \n03:32\u00a0<Pon>\u00a0amazing ^^;  \n03:32\u00a0<Pon>\u00a0UTF8?????????

I have everything updated on my ui (ran svn up and maven stat) .. nothing new, everything seems updated. But my eclipse has some errors in EditObjectTest.java .. on method clickEditObject. I also checked the code from SVN, and it's the same. Odd thing is that that method doesn't exist anymore because vmassol refactored all the clickEdit methods (removed edit) from method names.  \n10:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0My question is .. how the hell hudson didn't failed the test  \n10:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: well hudson fail to build  \n10:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it did not even started the tests  \n10:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which is normal if it has \u00a0the same issue you have  \n10:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I am looking at Build #365 (Feb 9, 2011 1:11:48 AM)  \n10:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes build #365 is red as far as i can see  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0did not looked at the details but it definitely failed  \n10:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0oh so red spheres means failed build ? and test not run ?  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n10:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks ;) didn't know  \n10:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0now it makes sense :)  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0red: failed build  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0orange: failed tests  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0green: ok  \n10:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I was waiting to see a stack trace or something  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i mean blue  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not green  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i agree that there is not much blue on XE tests :)  \n10:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n10:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so in this case, should I create a patch to fix the build ?  \n10:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I only have to change 2-3 lines  \n10:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0need a committer :P  \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in which project is the issue ?  \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ui-tests ?  \n10:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n10:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0class EditObjectsTest.java  \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok openning it  \n10:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you already know what to change for sure ?  \n10:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0lines: ObjectEditPage oep = vp.clickEditObjects(); and \u00a0oep = vp.clickEditObjects();  \n10:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i can do it in that case (i don't know this project very well)  \n10:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0clickEditObjects() was refactored to EditObjects()  \n10:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0looking for the source of the issue  \n10:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I think vmassol didn't notice those  \n10:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0just a sec  \n11:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a034486 08.02.2011 15:15:20, by vmassol \u00a0this is the commit that changed the methods  \n11:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I see vmassol refactored that class to  \n11:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so I guess someone committed over it with the older values, can't figure it out  \n11:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so what is the patch exactly ?  \n11:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a034568 08.02.2011 23:35:34, by cjdelisle  \n11:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this commit broke it :)  \n11:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yey, found it  \n11:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so basically you have to replace :  \n11:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a01.
