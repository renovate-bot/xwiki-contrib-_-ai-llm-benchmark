 \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there has been big things introduced in 7.1RC1 so I feel that skipping it would not be very nice  \n11:43\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0tmortagne: I can only get the \"edit application\" button to show for users  \n11:43\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0how do i get to the data space level of the app?  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you are on application home page go to the space admin  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and then to the right setup  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and check what you have there  \n11:44\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0rightt thats it, thanks :)  \n11:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0@vmassol: I agree with tmortagne, a few days of testing the RC1 are needed  \n11:45\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0i was totally in the wrong pages  \n11:49\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n11:50\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n12:08\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:21\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:01\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:07\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:11\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:29\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:38\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has quit  \n13:42\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n14:18\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n14:24\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne mflorea: what's your proposal for the release?  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0knowing that the 8th is the final and we should not go beyond that date  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and knowing that RC1 is still not released!  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see how releasing RC1 will give us more testing time  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it will actually give us less time  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(because of the time to release)  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only way to get more testing time is to delay the final release but that's what we don't want/need  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting Monday we all need to be thinking about Nested Spaces!  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're going on a race against the clock...  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we need to put all the chances on our side)  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: all we are saying is that you are proposing to put big new thing in a final release, if it's impossible to release 7.1 final later than 8 then I don't really see what we can propose...  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0eaxctly  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want to properly test RC1 you need at least 1 week which we cannot afford  \n14:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also don't forget that we create a branch when releasing a RC1 so anybody can start working on nested space before 7.1 final if he does not have any task for 7.1  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: did you had time to look at WYSIWYGEditorConfigTest.testEnablePlugin ?  \n14:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so my proposal is: 1) release 7.1 final without a RC on Monday at latest 2) let the community test it and 3) release a 7.1.1 later on if we find blockers.  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: \u00a0it looks like a flickering, just a very frequent one  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this allows the dev team to start focusing on nested spaces  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we push 7.1 by one week we also pish the start of nested psaces by ones week  \n14:35\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again I don't see why, it's not because 7.1 final is not released that everyone is stuck working on 7.1 stuff  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who's doing the release?  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who's needed first on nested spaces?  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0who's going to release 7.1.1 when get find a blocker ?  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need you thomas :)  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and everyeon else FTM  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we need to brainstorm quickly about lots of stuff  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i'm the release manager for the next release anyway, called 7.1RC1 or 7.1 final I'm going to have to do a release anyway  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case we're 4 days late and I haven't seen any proposal for the new date of RC1 nor the final  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we know we should not have delayed the 7.1  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're proposing to move 7.1 final to 15th?  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: right now I'm waiting for mflorea to tell me what he found when looking at WYSIWYGEditorConfigTest.testEnablePlugin to finally start the release  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but we need to plan ahead too  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for the 7.1 final IMO we need 1 week after 7.1RC1  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that's roughly the 15th  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so during this one additoinal week we just wait for users to report issues?  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in the meantime we work on nested spaces?  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it also give time to msmeria to test it for example, and yes anyone who don't have something to finish or fix has no reason to not start working on nested spaces  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll send a mail then  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n14:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0triple-negative \u00a0highfive  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0could not stop  \n14:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0:)  \n14:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mail sent  \n15:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:10\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n15:11\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I commited a possible fix for the flickering test  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: but it's just a flickering right, nothing blocker to fix on runtime side ?  \n15:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep, nothing blocker  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think the test reloads the page before the AJAX save call is done and thus it doesn't get the expected changes  \n15:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0with my change it should wait for the page to be saved and then reload  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0moving home and will start the mave/git release in 30min  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n15:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:02\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0starting maven/git 7.1RC1 release  \n16:30\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:47\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n16:47\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:54\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:07\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0git/maven release done  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0master is now 7.2-SNAPSHOT  \n17:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't forget to merge your fixed in stable-7.1.x  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a07.1 jobs created in jenkins  \n17:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0nice  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: can I commit on platform?
