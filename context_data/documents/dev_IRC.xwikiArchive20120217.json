Issue is that it only happens on Chrome.. when editing a 1.0 Syntax page I get a modal that it is not supported, and all other tests after this will fail  \n15:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this would mean introducing custom code in the test.. like if browser == chrome, click on the modal to make it go away  \n15:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0or the best approach would be to create a pull request to exclude the test on Chrome FTM  \n15:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0wstyt ?  \n15:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*wdyt ?  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok better result: http://pastebin.com/xD3t3fEd  \n15:24\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: will we build platform too on the windows agents ?  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: not right now since it doesn't build on it ATM  \n15:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0because of the long paths, right ?  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n15:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so we're on the right track ...  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0committer activity for 1 year on all xwiki organization projects, sorted by activity: https://skitch.com/e-vmassol/8nxub/github-main.github-xwiki  \n15:30\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0hmm... I see yourself listed twice. Also, I have done more than 2 pull requests on platform + enterprise.

I am not a committer  \n15:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'm not even listed among the 17 committers, so I can't be a committer  \n15:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0how much RAM memory do we have allocated for our Jenkins Agents ?  \n15:54\u00a0<rsjafe>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:55\u00a0<rsjafe>\u00a0hi there, I'm having trouble getting the Meeting Manager Application to function properly.
