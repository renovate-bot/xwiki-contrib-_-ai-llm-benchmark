I mean, I'm the user and I want to activate it.  \nsburjan - (09:00): is this achievable ?  \nvmassol - (09:00): what doesn't work?  \nsburjan - (09:00): I can't find the option in the interface to activate it  \nvmassol - (09:00): errr?  \nvmassol - (09:00): you just told me you had found it and I told you how to find it  \nvmassol - (09:00): I don't understand  \nvmassol - (09:01): it's \"user type\"  \nsburjan - (09:01): let me explain better  \nsburjan - (09:01): oh  \nsburjan - (09:02): nvm, I found  \nsburjan - (09:02): kinda tricky for a newcomer to find it  \nvmassol - (09:02): sburjan: I'm curious to understand what is not easy  \nsburjan - (09:03): well.. I go to my user preferences  \nsburjan - (09:03): and there I have Change Password as a button  \nvmassol - (09:03): change password?  \nvmassol - (09:04): are you using the colibri skin?  \nsburjan - (09:04): and for editing preferences i have that pencil icon that takes me to enable advanced menu  \nsburjan - (09:04): no, currently toucan  \nsburjan - (09:04): let me switch to colibri  \nvmassol - (09:04): they're the same actually  \nvmassol - (09:04): just tested  \nvmassol - (09:04): so what's the not easy thing? You don't see the pencil icon?  \nvmassol - (09:05): you don't see what it means?  \nvmassol - (09:05): or is it because you see a button for password and would expect a button for the left options too?  \nsburjan - (09:06): It's okay, I was a little bit of confused because I didn't see the pencil icon there  \nsburjan - (09:06): yes, something like that. but abviously, the password button is much more important than the other, so it should be more visible  \nvmassol - (09:06): note: personally I don't like too much the fact that there's two columns for the preferences but that's another story to discuss with caty and jean-vincent  \nsburjan - (09:10): sorry for disturbing you :P  \nvmassol - (09:12): sburjan: no no please continue to ask questions  \nvmassol - (09:13): it's important  \nvmassol - (09:13): and since you're improving the documentation it's important you fully understand things  \nsburjan - (09:14): okay  \nmariusbutuc joined #xwiki at 09:14  \nsburjan - (09:14): I'm doing my best to do a good job  \nvmassol - (09:14): nice geek&poke today: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GeekAndPoke/~3/p7dTVNo5N9w/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-coder---part-8.html :)  \nvmassol - (09:14): sburjan: good!  \nsburjan - (09:16): vmassol : for the pages I edit, for example, I have to re-take various screenshots, because the interface got modified in the meantime. should I insert screenshots from both skins ? For example, in the comments section, should I put a screenshot from Colibri, and one from Toucan, or only one of them is enough ?  \nvmassol - (09:17): sburjan: it's a good question. We've discussed it quicky on the list but I don't recall our policy. Let me try to find that thread again  \nmariusbutuc left at 09:17 (Client Quit  \nvmassol - (09:18): that's part of the things we need to document on xwiki.org in dev.xwiki.org (the rules for editing xwiki.org). We haven't defined any of them strictly right now  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 09:18  \nvmassol - (09:18): sburjan: found the thread: http://markmail.org/message/ou7hgdiiwgayghku reading....  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:20): Good morning. It seems that if a page is in a space which the current user cannot view (even if he can view the page itself), including the page fails. Bug?  \nsburjan - (09:20): hmm.. making a documentation page for 2 versions backwards, I'm not sure on how to do that, I'll have to ask Silvia  \nvmassol - (09:21): sburjan: is that what we decidd?  \nvmassol - (09:21): I thought it was the opposite  \nsburjan - (09:22): no, I only saw the proposal  \nvmassol - (09:22): well the proposal proposes something  \nvmassol - (09:23): which is the opposite to what you say  \nsburjan - (09:23): I don't see any final conclusion  \nvmassol - (09:23): it does sinec everyone \u00a0agrees :)  \nvmassol - (09:23): but yes  \nvmassol - (09:23): we need to conclude formally  \nvmassol - (09:23): so basically  \nvmassol - (09:23): for versions  \nvmassol - (09:23): - only document the latest version  \nsburjan - (09:24): okay. for both themes where it is space on the right side ? or for uniformity, only for Colibri  \nvmassol - (09:24): - export the documentation at release time or add some comment (not decided)  \nvmassol - (09:24): - use a since icon  \nvmassol - (09:25): do you understand the since icon?  \nsburjan - (09:26): hmm... nop  \nvmassol - (09:26): it measn for ex when a new feature is introduced, it's documented in \u00a0section and we put a \"Since XE 2.4\" icon next to it  \nsburjan - (09:26): ah  \nsburjan - (09:26): I understand now  \nvmassol - (09:26): so users can see  \nvmassol - (09:26): if the feature exists for the version they're using  \nvmassol - (09:26): someone needs to propose the details of how to do it  \nvmassol - (09:26): maybe you could discuss it with silvia and make a proposal to the list  \nvmassol - (09:27): in answer to this thread?  \nvmassol - (09:27): note that you could talk to Caty for help on ergonomy/UI  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 09:27  \nvmassol - (09:28): then once we all agree about the details we can document it somewhere on dev.xwiki.org  \nvmassol - (09:29): another idea I had was to use the annotation feature  \nvmassol - (09:30): but it has some drawbacks  \nvmassol - (09:31): the best probably is to create a \"since\" macro  \nvmassol - (09:31): that you would use like this: {{since version=\"2.4\"/}}  \nvmassol - (09:32): (or using the wysiwyg editor)  \nsburjan - (09:32): thanks  \nvmassol - (09:32): we just need to define what it would look like visually and where to place it  \nvmassol - (09:32): sburjan: can you own this topic and make a proposal on the list?  \nsburjan - (09:33): yes, but I'm gonna have to learn how to do this, I never worked with these things before  \nvmassol - (09:35): sburjan: you can talk to silvia or ask questions here  \nsburjan - (09:35): yes.  \nvmassol - (09:35): sburjan: basically it's about finding a way to improve the consistency of our doc on xwiki.org  \nvmassol - (09:35): 2 things we're not doing consistently is version handling and skin handling  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 09:36  \nvmassol - (09:36): which is why I started a proposal on the dev list (the thread I pointed you to)  \nvmassol - (09:36): but as you can see the details have not been defined  \nsburjan - (09:36): yes... we should create a \"standard\"  \nvmassol - (09:36): and I didn't get the time to continue it  \nvmassol - (09:36): but since you're now working with silvia on improving the doc  \nvmassol - (09:36): I thought it could be good if you continue the proposal work  \nvmassol - (09:36): on these 2 domains  \nvmassol - (09:37): of course you can ask for ideas and questions here or on the list  \nvmassol - (09:37): the idea is that you propose something in a few days on the list (say for early next week for example)  \nvmassol - (09:37): would that be ok with you?  \nvmassol - (09:38): (you can talk to Silvia about it)  \nsburjan - (09:38): yes, It would be okay. BUt an important aspect is that it must be correct from multiple pov's  \nvmassol - (09:38): yes  \nsburjan - (09:38): I'm thinking to set a stanrad for screenshot sizes too  \nsburjan - (09:39): or at least... 3 standard sizes  \nsburjan - (09:39): it would give a much more uniform look to the documentation  \nvmassol - (09:39): yes good idea  \nsburjan - (09:39): and a professional touch .. not only a mash-up look  \nsburjan - (09:40): and I'm even thinking on how to set names to the attachments  \nvmassol - (09:40): sburjan: one thing to keep in mind. We want people to contribute doc  \nvmassol - (09:40): so we need rules to ensure consistency, look, etc  \nvmassol - (09:40): but at the same time we shouldn't have too many  \nvmassol - (09:40): lest people won't help on the doc part :)  \nvmassol - (09:41): so we need to find the right balance  \nsburjan - (09:41): yes ... but I think that if we create a solid \"standard\" others will be able to adapt very easily  \nvmassol - (09:41): and focus on the most important stuff only  \nvmassol - (09:41): yes  \nsburjan - (09:41): maybe I'll stard on a document on how to write/maintain the documentation ?  \nsburjan - (09:41): \\*start  \nvmassol - (09:41): yes defintiely  \nvmassol - (09:42): you can start it in the Drafts space on dev.xwiki.org  \nvmassol - (09:42): and when it's agreed on the list  \nvmassol - (09:42): move it to a proper place  \nsburjan - (09:42): because the documentation is pretty big already, and we need some general guides  \nvmassol - (09:42): http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/  \nsburjan - (09:42): ah, okay  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 09:43  \nvmassol - (09:43): the real important part is to get community approval  \nsburjan - (09:43): So I guess I should starting on it right now...  \njvdrean left at 09:43 (Client Quit  \nsburjan - (09:43): so i won't have to \"refactor\" the pages I already modified  \nvmassol - (09:44): sounds good  \nvmassol - (09:44): you can organize your time with Silvia  \nvmassol - (09:44): I don't know your plan  \nvmassol - (09:44): btw it would be good if you could send a mail on the dev list  \nsburjan - (09:44): well, I have a list of todo's :)  \nsburjan - (09:44): i'm gonna talk to silvia  \nvmassol - (09:44): just to introduce yourself and explain what you'll be contributing to  \nsburjan - (09:44): okay, I'll do that  \nvmassol - (09:44): just so everyone knows who you are  \nvmassol - (09:45): and what you're doing  \nvmassol - (09:45): a few lines is enough ;)  \nvmassol - (09:45): (no need for a novel)  \nmflorea - (09:50): guys, in a path-based multiwiki, can I access the main wiki using xwiki/bin/view/Space/Page instead of xwiki/wiki/xwiki/view/Space/Page ?  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:53  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 09:55  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 09:56  \nvmassol - (09:57): mflorea: I don't know but if you ask I guess it's becuase it doesn't work?  \nvmassol - (09:57): I think I recall it default to the main wiki is \"wiki/\" is not found  \nvmassol - (09:58): let me try to find where it's coded  \nmflorea - (10:01): vmassol: one of our users complains that in a path-based multiwiki the wiki detected for http://server1/xwiki/resources/js/xwiki/wysiwyg/xwe/WikiService.gwtrpc is \"server1\" instead of \"xwiki\"  \nvmassol - (10:01): checking XWiki.getXWiki  \nmflorea - (10:02): I have a servlet filter that is applied for \\*.gwtrpc URLs and initializes the XWiki context.  \nevalica left at 10:03 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmassol - (10:04): mflorea: this is the code: http://tinypaste.com/2e65a3  \nvmassol - (10:05): ah yes  \nvmassol - (10:05): so indeed  \nvmassol - (10:05): if you don't have /wiki  \nvmassol - (10:05): then it defaults to non path-based resolution  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:06  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:06): vmassol: Hi.  \nsburjan - (10:06): vmassol : sent the mail to devs, I hope it was okay  \nvmassol - (10:06): CalebJamesDeLisl: hi  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:07): I have some changes to TestUtils I want to commit. Your change to LoginAndGotoPage is why the tests were failing.  \nvmassol - (10:07): tmortagne can explain this better I guess ;)  \nvmassol - (10:07): CalebJamesDeLisl: I tested before my change and after and I got the same erros  \ntmortagne - (10:07): don't have the previous messages  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 10:08  \nmflorea - (10:08): tmortagne: there's a mail on the users mailing list complaining that for http://server1/xwiki/resources/js/xwiki/wysiwyg/xwe/WikiService.gwtrpc the detected wiki is \"server1\" (it's a path-based multiwiki)  \nvmassol - (10:08): CalebJamesDeLisl: which is why I was saying I wasn't sure about my commit since I couldn't test if it worked  \nvmassol - (10:09): tmortagne: why do you default to domain based resolution when usepath is set to true?  \nvmassol - (10:09): shouldn't we consider that the wiki is the default one in this case?  \nvmassol - (10:09): (when usepath is set to true and there's no \"wiki/\" part I mean)  \ntmortagne - (10:09): mflorea: yes by default it's the server1 because in host \"server1\" the first part (before the first dot) is \"server1\"  \ntmortagne - (10:09): default what ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:09): vmassol: These are new: http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/870/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/  \nmflorea - (10:09): but the wiki is path-based  \ntmortagne - (10:10): vmassol: it's about url generation ?  \ntmortagne - (10:10): it's not what you asked mflorea  \nvmassol - (10:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: you have a fix or should I fix it?  \ntmortagne - (10:10): i don't see anything related to url patch based multiwiki in your URL mflorea  \ntmortagne - (10:11): s/patch/path/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:11): I have a fix but it removes your speed change.  \nvmassol - (10:11): tmortagne: path based is a config option right?  \ntmortagne - (10:11): vmassol: yes it's a config option  \nvmassol - (10:11): xwiki.Param(\"xwiki.virtual.usepath.servletpath\", \"wiki\")  \nvmassol - (10:11): so you can't see it in the url  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:11): I wrote that function for setting the state so I don't like the idea that it might possibly not do what it's suppsed to.  \ntmortagne - (10:11): let me read the mail since it's not clear what it wrong from your POV  \nvmassol - (10:12): CalebJamesDeLisl: I understand  \nvmassol - (10:12): I'm ok if you remove my changes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:12): Ok to commit?  \nvmassol - (10:12): but provided you review the tests to speed them up  \nvmassol - (10:12): such as the ImportTest  \nvmassol - (10:12): which is the one I was reviewing and fixing  \nvmassol - (10:12): are you also removing the speed up I've done for gotoPage?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:12): I don't think so, what was it?  \nvmassol - (10:13): CalebJamesDeLisl: have a look at gotoPage  \nvmassol - (10:13): it's checking if you're not already on that url  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:13): I remember, no I'm not.  \nvmassol - (10:13): TBH I haven't checked if that check is done internally by webdriver or not  \nvmassol - (10:13): the only use case where we would have a problem would be if we wanted to do a refresh but for that we could introduce a new api  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:14): I also added some more checks to loginAndGoto is more trustworthy.  \nmflorea - (10:14): tmortagne: in a path-based multiwiki resources are shared, so for any subwiki, the WYSIWYG editor is loaded from http://server1/xwiki/resources/js/xwiki/wysiwyg/xwe/ . When I make an AJAX request, it's URL is relative to the place where the JS code was downloaded, so the request goes to http://server1/xwiki/resources/js/xwiki/wysiwyg/xwe/WikiService.gwtrpc . I have a servlet filter that catches this request and initializes the XWiki context. The detected wik  \ntmortagne - (10:15): mflorea: no resources are not shared, it was a bug in older versions  \nmflorea - (10:15): hmm  \ntmortagne - (10:15): unless there is a place asking for resource without using URL factory  \ntmortagne - (10:16): hmm wait  \ntmortagne - (10:16): resources is different actually yes  \nmflorea - (10:16): so what would be the correct URL instead of http://server1/xwiki/resources/js/xwiki/wysiwyg/xwe/XWikiWysiwyg.js ?  \ntmortagne - (10:16): since it's not about wiki  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:16): vmassol: Committed.  \ntmortagne - (10:16): it's shared even in domain based multiwiki  \nmflorea - (10:17): yes  \ntmortagne - (10:17): but not when skin action is used  \ntmortagne - (10:17): it's only for direct resources  \ntmortagne - (10:18): anyway the point is that domain name multiwiki is never disabled  \nvmassol - (10:18): jvelociter, tmortagne, everyone: we need to decide if we're ok to accept wiki macros in the default XE distribution  \ntmortagne - (10:18): it's just overriden by path based when path based is provided  \nvmassol - (10:18): (and where to put it in svn if we do)  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:18  \nvmassol - (10:18): (and when we're ok to have a wiki macro and when it should be a java macro)  \njvelociter - (10:18): vmassol: what's the candidate ?  \ntmortagne - (10:19): vmassol: maybe an example but i don't see the point of having real macro in XE as wiki macros  \nvmassol - (10:19): a new contributor is going to be available to write macros  \ntmortagne - (10:19): java macro are easier to unit test erc...  \nvmassol - (10:19): we need to provide a list of macros  \njvelociter - (10:19): for me it's ok to have wiki macros. It probably will force us to fix the programming right  \nvmassol - (10:19): we had started here http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/NewMacros  \nvmassol - (10:19): but we need to review it  \nvmassol - (10:19): and to start with a wiki macro is easier to write than a java macro  \nvmassol - (10:19): tmortagne: yes agreed so we need to decide if there's a use case for wiki macros  \nvmassol - (10:20): ok I'll send a mail  \nvmassol - (10:20): on the devs list  \njvelociter - (10:20): java macros are maybe easier to test, but sometimes it''s overkill  \nsburjan - (10:20): vmassol : another thing I don't quite understand. Why the xwiki platform sees diffrently(as diffrent file names) two files with the same name, but capitalized extension. Example: image.PNG != image.png. On the web, shouldn't be any diffrence for a user ?  \njvelociter - (10:20): I would not write a java macro that outputs a complex XDOM  \njvelociter - (10:20): like a table with a lot of data  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 10:21  \nvmassol - (10:22): sburjan: that's simply because xwiki is case-sensitive in general  \nvmassol - (10:23): sburjan: it's the same reason why logging with \"Admin\" or \"admin\" is not the same thing too  \nvmassol - (10:23): more generally speaking it's an inheritance from unix systems  \nsburjan - (10:23): and you consider this as a good feature ? I mean, you want this ?  \nvmassol - (10:23): well it's hard to change  \nsburjan - (10:23): most of web sites aren't case sensitive (except password fields)  \njvelociter - (10:23): (for example I have a SVN macro that builds a table of data, a fisheye-light like - I would never have written it as a java macro)  \nsburjan - (10:24): I see.. okay  \nvmassol - (10:24): jvelociter: do you have a written example?  \nvmassol - (10:24): because you loose a lot with wiki macros  \njvelociter - (10:24): I can try to find it, yes  \nvmassol - (10:24): so I'm not sure it's overkill  \njvelociter - (10:25): you loose things but you gain other  \nmflorea - (10:25): tmortagne: so what needs to be fixed? The WYSIWYG services don't need to have the XWiki content initialized for a specific wiki. When I need documents from a wiki I send the wiki names as a parameter to that service. So the XWiki context initialized for GWTRPC requests should always be the main wiki. In other works, the URL of the GWTRPC request doesn't have to contain information about the (sub)wiki.  \njvelociter - (10:25): it's a balance  \nvmassol - (10:25): loose a lot = no IDE, no debugging, no easy automated test  \nvmassol - (10:25): no easy rules too  \nvmassol - (10:25): ie no easy checkstyle  \nvmassol - (10:25): etc  \njvelociter - (10:25): yes but I don't need that for my macrio  \nvmassol - (10:25): while it's fine for a user to do  \nvmassol - (10:26): I'm less sure it's fine for a platform to provide it  \nvmassol - (10:26): as a default macro  \njvelociter - (10:26): yes that's different  \njvelociter - (10:26): I agree with that  \njvelociter - (10:26): it will be easier to refuse to have wiki macros in platform once we have the stores  \nvmassol - (10:27): sure but even without that  \njvelociter - (10:27): since we can say by default there are almost no macros at all :)  \nvmassol - (10:27): it's easy to install a XAR  \nvmassol - (10:27): yes  \njvelociter - (10:27): yes, but there's a big difference in discoverability  \nvmassol - (10:29): jvelociter: I guess for wiki macros it depends if the macro is generic or application-specific  \nvmassol - (10:29): for application-specific macros we could allow wiki macros  \njvelociter - (10:31): as a development practice, yes that could be nice  \njvelociter - (10:31): to have blog macros, etc  \nvmassol - (10:31): mail sent  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 10:37  \nlucaa left at 10:39 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 10:39  \ntmortagne - (10:42): mflorea: sorry was in a short meeting, let me think it's indeed an issue when server1 is already the alias of a subwiki you can't access the main with with that host, now we never had this issue because usually the host you are using for your farm is not \"server1\" but \"www.something.com\", etc...  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 10:42  \ntmortagne - (10:43): looks like a pretty weird use case to me but i need to think of what to do about it  \nmflorea - (10:48): there's not much I can do from GWT code because I map GWTRPC services to URL using annotations like @RemoteServiceRelativePath(\"WikiService.gwtrpc\") .

If it was a very old version, it might have been before skin extensions were added to the xwiki.cfg file but I don't think that's the case.  \ndegro - (22:51): the css is not missing completely  \ndegro - (22:51): that's the funny part  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:51): The skin is defined in XWikiPreferences, maybe it hasn't been loaded yet in which case it will clear up soon.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:52): Is it just the color scheme? (everything grey)  \ndegro - (22:52): nope, it looks \\*almost\\* as if it didn't have css at all, it only shows some background images for some list items... and a few other minor things  \ndegro - (22:53): but overall, it looks like it's missing completely  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:55): Do you have firebug?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:55): Actually you can just view source and search for colibri.css  \ndd left at 22:56 (  \ndegro - (22:59): hm, it's not colibri at all  \ndegro - (23:00): the link href points to /xwiki/bin/skin/skins/albatross/null  \ndegro - (23:00): what the  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:02): Is the skin supposed to be colibri?  \ndegro - (23:02): yes  \ndegro - (23:02): that's what I had on 2.2.5  \ndegro - (23:02): I mean I just left the default one, didn't even change it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:03): and no colibri.css in the source code. Hmm.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:04): try punching in the url with ?skin=colibri just to see what happens  \ndegro - (23:10): same thing, it's still looking for the albatross/null css file  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:12): You didn't import any new stuff like XWikiPreferences?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:12): Look for style.css in your source code.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:13): \\*page source  \ndegro - (23:14): I didn't import anything, just unpacked the war  \ndegro - (23:14): http://tinypaste.com/931705  \ndegro - (23:14): here's the Main.WebHome source  \ndegro - (23:15): <meta name=\"gwt:property\" content=\"locale=en\" />  \ndegro - (23:15): that's definitely not good.  \nanna\\_\\_\\_ left at 23:17 (Quit: anna\\_\\_\\_  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:20): Go to your administration interface and select the section \"Presentation\" then check the value of the \"default stylesheet and skin.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:20): \"  \nvmassol left at 23:20 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:20): I'm not sure why you are getting null but I think you'll be up and working if you put style.css into the \"default stylesheet\" field.  \ndegro - (23:22): it already is style.css  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:25): Hmm. On my installation it's empty. Maybe try clearing it.  \ndegro - (23:25): anyway, I'll just go with a clean install, and I'll import the documents I need from the 2.2.5 install  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:25): Try everything - the Caleb method of fixing things.  \ndegro - (23:26): heh  \ndegro - (23:26): I cleared it, and it still don't work.  \ndegro - (23:27): I'll take the 2.3.1 zip, export the docs from the 2.2.5 and import them on the new one  \ndegro left #xwiki at 23:27  \ndegro joined #xwiki at 23:27  \ndegro - (23:27): oops  \ndegro - (23:28): accidentally closed the window  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:28): Export/import sounds workable.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:29): Imports fail around 30 megabytes but I doubt you have that many documents.  \ndegro - (23:29): nah, it's 16 documents, lol  \ndegro - (23:29): I'm working on an application  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:31): Hey, a developer! Cool.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:31): You know you can make your application have it's own icon in the administration interface?  \ndegro - (23:31): I did, actually.  \ndegro - (23:32): with the ConfigurableClass  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:32): Yup. Any other things you find you need, bug me.  \ndegro - (23:32): glad to hear you're buggable  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:32): I might not write them right away but I'll file the idea.  \ndegro - (23:32): it's you who contributed the ConfigurableClass, eh?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:33): It is my fault for that horror.  \ndegro - (23:33): lulz  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:34): Really the internals are constantly breaking and producing bad XHTML.  \ndegro - (23:34): eh, it works, at least :)  \ndegro - (23:34): it did what I wanted  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:35): Eventually I want to port all of the administration sections over to using it. Debugging first.  \ndegro - (23:35): oh, yeah, that's a good idea - consistency  \ndegro - (23:36): where's the 'e' in your name?  \ndegro - (23:36): not enough room?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:37): 16 char limit.  \ndegro - (23:37): haha  \ndegro - (23:37): no unix-style usernames for you, is it?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:38): You can use caps in unix ;)  \ndegro - (23:38): je sais  \ndegro - (23:38): :p  \ndegro - (23:39): xwiki is cool. when it doesn't break when upgrading  \ndegro - (23:39): actually, this was my first upgrade ever - probably the third time will be a charm  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:39): I never find someone else on freenode is using my username and I need a \\_ or a 1 after it.  \ndegro - (23:40): yeah, that is an advantage  \ndegro - (23:40): I doubt that cdelisle would be taken, either  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:40): Re upgrade. that's odd because I upgrade constantly and nver have any issue.  \ndegro - (23:40): I must have messed something up...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:42): I build enterprise with maven then run a bash script which deletes the original, copys the new one in, then copies in my hibernate file and the postgres jdbc driver.  \ndegro - (23:42): nerdy  \ndegro - (23:42): I use Finder, lol.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:42): It's quick and easy.  \ndegro - (23:42): yeah, must be  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:43): Except my copy of jetty is ancient since it's never updated.  \ndegro - (23:44): my new mouse is coming in tomorrow, yahoo!  \ndegro - (23:44): my wheel isn't working - really frustrating  \ndegro - (23:44): I have to use the arrow keys constantly  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:45): Ahh yes I have a micro$oft mouse which the wheel started rubbing, I took it apart and filed down the part around the wheel. works great now.  \ndegro - (23:45): lol  \ndegro - (23:45): mine actually has a ball, it's a stupid mighty mouse, i took it apart like.. 289 times  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:46): Yea, laser is so much better.  \ndegro - (23:46): but steelseries xai mouse & steelseries 4HD mousepad will probably do the trick for the next 2 years  \nlucaa left at 23:46 (Quit: Leaving.  \ndegro - (23:47): do you know the MultiPageExport app?  \ndegro - (23:47): (you probably do)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:47): Nope.  \ndegro - (23:47): really. http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/MultiPageExportApplication  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:48): I've heard of it, no experience with it though.  \ndegro - (23:48): does the trick - the only wrong thing about it is that the right column (selected pages) doesn't have select all/none links  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:49): sounds like a job for javascript.  \ndegro - (23:50): yeah  \ndegro - (23:50): are you american?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:50): Yup.  \ndegro - (23:51): prolly the only one around  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:51): I think so. I keep meeting new people though.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:53): I'm spending some \"free time\" working on a script to allow you to generate xml files for an xar using text files for content.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:53): I'll post to the sandbox when it is working.  \ndegro - (23:53): nice  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:54): Internally it's a serialization framework. I overbuild things.  \ndegro - (23:54): I'll be contributing my first app soon, anxious, anxious, anxious  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:54): What's it going to do?  \ndegro - (23:54): Expense Reports  \nsdumitriu left at 23:54 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:55): fun fun fun!  \ndegro - (23:55): money involves fun!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:55): Or maybe the other way around.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:55): You use Linux/gnome?  \ndegro - (23:56): os x/ubuntu gnome  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:56): I have some syntax highlighters for gedit which make velocity soo much easier to write.  \ndegro - (23:57): yeah, me too, a vtl.lang i found on some old nabble list  \ndegro - (23:57): it's pretty cool  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:57): I have that but I hacked it to be able to highlight #directives  \ndegro - (23:57): oh, nice  \ndegro - (23:58): and I use it side by side with this: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:58): Also I wrote the beginnings of a xwiki2 highlighter. It understands macros, {{velocity}} switches to vtl macro etc.  \ndegro - (23:58): JS?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:59): In my xwiki2 highlighter if you go {{html}} then it switches to html highlighting and if <script> is seen inside of that it switches to js.  \n\n"}
