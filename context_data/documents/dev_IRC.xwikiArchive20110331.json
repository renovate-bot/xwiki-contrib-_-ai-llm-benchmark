We should make this script available directly in the wiki. Same as we did with the Blog migration. It needs to be easy for users somehow.

Removing XWikiDocument is a massive task, it is used everywhere.  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you want to remove it?  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't get it  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who said anything about removing it?  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the strategy I highlighted in these mails  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is not to remove it  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but to write a new model  \n22:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok so you mean to pear it down by deprectaion and removal until it is 500 lines?  \n22:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't remember things that well (IE mailing list threads) but I seem to recall the \"replace and remove\" pattern was the chosen path.  \n22:24\u00a0<rstavro>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first step would be http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/contrib/sandbox/xwiki-model/  \n22:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/contrib/sandbox/xwiki-model/xwiki-model-bridge/  \n22:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/contrib/sandbox/xwiki-model/xwiki-model-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/model/Document.java  \n22:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^replace and remove?  \n22:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is a new api it doesn't remove anything  \n22:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0interface  \n22:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But you don't intend for XWikiDocument to actually last forever right?  \n22:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correct  \n22:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the second step is to have a new impleentation for the interfaces  \n22:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using JCR or something else  \n22:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Has that pattern worked before?  \n22:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the third step is to offer a config switch \u00a0to choose the implementation to use  \n22:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the fourth step is to move out the old model impl  \n22:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Actually, captcha is an example of that pattern working, except that unlike XWikiDocument, jcaptcha plugin degraded to uselessness and was used by practically nobody so it was actually new functionality.  \n22:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you have a better idea please raise it on the list so that we can discuss it  \n22:30\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't know if trying to drag old classes and interfaces into the 21 century is a better idea or not because I don't have much information on whether \"replace and remove\" (as I call it) has worked before on a large scale.  \n22:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I know for sure is that rewrite has failed a LOT for people who tried it  \n22:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0rewrite meaning to pick away at old classes and try to make them new again?  \n22:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rewrite means to start again from scratch and throw away the old code  \n22:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which in practice means 2 branches  \n22:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes, that sounds like a very big gamble.  \n22:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the strategy I have followed so far is:  \n22:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- slim down XWiki and XWikiDocument by moving out domains that are not related to the model  \n22:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- when all that's left is the model do what we mentioned above  \n22:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are still quite a few domains to move out  \n22:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0+1 for slimming down. Even if we do replace & remove after it will make the interfaces more compatable when the change comes.  \n22:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one thing we need to do btw is remove all deprecated methods in the backward compat aspects and xwiki-legacy module and then remove completely after some time  \n22:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/remove/move/  \n22:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've not been applying this diligently  \n22:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not always easy since it means fixing all places using the deprecated code to use the new way)  \n22:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex we still have quite a lot of places using String and not Entity References  \n22:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I like spotting code that is unused and then breaking it before someone comes along and uses it.  \n22:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we cannot yet remove get/set methods that take a string in XWikiDocument  \n22:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would remove a lot of them  \n22:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually right now with the introduction of Entity Refernce we've increased the size of XWikiDocument ;)  \n22:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I know, when I scanned for unused code I kept running in to them.  \n22:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our problem is that we don't spend a lot of time working on reducing our techincal debt in each release  \n22:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we spend some time but not nearly enough compared to the work that has to be done  \n22:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the tech debt is huge  \n22:40\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Features are fun.  \n22:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah that too although I don't feel we're too feature-oriented as a dev team  \n22:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we do spend a huge amount of time fixing old stuff  \n22:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when we would globally spend less time by having worked on removing them  \n22:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but it's harder to do and takes time)  \n22:41\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0OTOH when old stuff is constantly breaking...  \n22:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0c.x.x.api.Document is a very nice class, it might be the ticket to removing XWikiDocument.  \n22:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If you can back c.x.x.api.Document with something else then most legacy scripting will be happy with you.  \n22:43\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Then there is nothing keeping XWikiDocument from being removed.  \n22:43\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0(of course it's a very large value of 'nothing')  \n22:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wouldn't call Document api nice\u2026.  \n22:44\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It may not be what we want but imagine the horror if XWikiDocument were exposed to velocity script.  \n22:44\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0We would be imprisoned with no way out.  \n22:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it almost is  \n22:45\u00a0<rstavro>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n22:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and Document keeps growing whenever there's a need in scripting  \n22:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0We are not tough enough on new API.  \n22:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0except when we are able to create a new module and use the new $services api  \n22:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you cannot be tough  \n22:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we can do it properly  \n22:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0remember that xwiki is not a wiki!  \n22:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a development platform  \n22:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Indeed. Wiki has become quite a misnomer.  \n22:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you cannot say no to something that should be available to scripting  \n22:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you can properly isoltae it in its own domain exposed through $services  \n22:48\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Well, I suppose things should be available as extensions.  \n22:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n22:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the $services model  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's completely dynamic  \n22:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Without extensions anything anyone needs is forced on everyone until the jvm 10GB of premgen space.  \n22:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*needs  \n22:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes the idea is to move stuff out of core and make them extensions, that's what we started doing since 2007  \n22:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just slow  \n22:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'e really missing IX to make that happen for UI though\u2026.  \n22:51\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Re storage (what I should be talking about) I imagine one load/save operation for documents, objects and properties.  \n22:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not scalable  \n22:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't scale if you have lots of objects/properties  \n22:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you need that + ability to restrict how many you get at once  \n22:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ api to get others  \n22:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or maybe you mean something else  \n22:53\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\"restrict how many you get at once\" eager/lazy is a problem which I have not figured out a good automatic solution for.  \n22:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well in the same manner as the searchDocument api works  \n22:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll have to leave soon  \n22:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Any plans for tomorrow (prank)?  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to skin in the alps  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/skin/ski/  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n22:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I was thinking more about the site but that works.  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll leave it to you guys to do the prank....  \n22:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0preview of xwiki3.0 like nothing you hae ever seen before.....  \n22:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0(youtube video)  \n22:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0idk rickrolling is kind of cheap.  \n22:57\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I will start a mockup on the fastest ever loader which loads documents/objects/properties all in one function then we can talk with something to look at.  \n22:58\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0(and is based on something that functions in a cloud ofc)  \n23:09\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n23:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:51\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
