 \n09:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't know  \n09:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It wasn't complaining there  \n09:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I got past the problem by building the whole platform with the correct parent once  \n09:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Then restarting the relese  \n09:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Only then the linkchecker problem was reported  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so how can I reproduce the issue you had?  \n09:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You could try to reproduce it by checking out 998ad598a1802301462751e39566a7190c822817 and compute the effective pom for all platform modules, starting from the root  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Then check the value for commons.version  \n09:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It should be 3.3-milestone-2 everywhere if everything is correct  \n09:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But I got it wrong on two agent machines  \n09:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It used to work well during milestone-1  \n09:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0There's no visible change in the maven modules that could be responsible for this  \n09:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0One of the bad modules was xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-observation/xwiki-platform-observation-remote  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: you haven't put doc for the EM UI in RN  \n09:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm... It might have been caused by the bad linkchecker dependencies, since that was also broken, and it could have brought in a wrong xwiki-platform-observation parent somehow, one taken from the local repository instead of the one created by the release plugin  \n09:14\u00a0<nIMBVS>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0By the way, the actual problem reported was that SNAPSHOT dependencies were detected by the release plugin  \n09:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Yes, I was writing them when you showed up  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I saw the tweet and blog post  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why I thought it strange  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:16\u00a0<nIMBVS>\u00a0hi.

Thomas was doing the same, but in place of looking for the bar in the document, he tried to access it using a property of the Livetable object, which require the Livetable object to be globally accessible  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only thing I told thomas is that I wasn't 100% sure that if the loading progress bar disappeared meant that all rows were displayed  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but he checked and said it should be ok  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if that works it's fine  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whether it's access through a js var or through the HTML (if they're set in sync)  \n10:52\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:53\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: the UI for extension manager is really broken on my side, is that so bad ?

 \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this has nothnig to do with maven  \n18:42\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0(for an extension that is not the same)  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't depend on maven  \n18:42\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but we use similar constrain for extension ids  \n18:44\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but I agee, two field is better  \n18:44\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but we have already two field and we were confused to discover that both are search field ?  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is not having 2 fields  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have lot of places where we have more than 2 field :)  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/2/1/  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's having a field without explanations as to what you shoudl enter and what it does  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also this is an advanced use case  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it should be kind of \"hidden\"  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either only visible for advanced users or you have to click on a \"manual install\" button or an \"advanced\" button or  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0...  \n18:46\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0installing extension will still be advanced usage when these extension cames with dependencies, etc...  \n18:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so, this is not only for getting the extension that we need an extended interface probably  \n18:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0by the way, looking at the list of installed extension is already an advanced view, since it will display dependencies  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes IMO we should filter non xwiki dependencies by default  \n18:49\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0do you means that XWiki depencies are not advanced ?  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: I'm ready to commit the priority feature for listeners, should I go ahead?  \n18:49\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0you have my +1  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go drive my kid to karate, will commit when I'm back  \n18:50\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but do not forget the documentation :)  \n18:50\u00a0<Dan\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<Dan\\_\\_>\u00a0hi  \n18:51\u00a0<Dan\\_\\_>\u00a0is now known as <Guest64411>  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: I hesitated to deprecate EventListener but I kept it not deprecated for now  \n18:51\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0do you means that all listener will have priorities ?  \n18:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:52\u00a0<Guest64411>\u00a0vmassol: hi  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbl  \n18:52\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I thought you could have both mixed, so if you do not care, you just use the simple EventListener  \n18:53\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0which would be run at the end in any order, no ?  \n18:56\u00a0<Guest64411>\u00a0hmm, don't recall how to change my nick  \n18:57\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:58\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0ok  \n18:58\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0using a chat client  \n18:59\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0vmassol, perhaps you recall we briefly discussed the idea of an R&D project related to xwiki  \n18:59\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0that was a couple of months ago  \n19:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hey Dan181, vmassol is away for a while  \n19:01\u00a0<Guest64411>\u00a0has quit  \n19:01\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0oh, thanks, i thought i saw him post a message before  \n19:02\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0are you also working for xwiki.com  \n19:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n19:02\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0would it be ok if i pick up with you the initial discussion i had with vmassol  \n19:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sure  \n19:03\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0can i im you  \n19:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You can try, I'm not sure if it will work, the freenode servers don't always allow private chats  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: yes right now you can have both, internally it always uses a priority (the default one if none is specified)  \n19:37\u00a0<CIA-102>\u00a0Eduard Moraru\u000f master\u000f \\* rdfc1cfb\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-workspace/xwiki-platform-workspace-ui/src/main/resources/WorkspaceManager/Install.xml :\u000f Applied the workaround for issue XWIKI 7184 (#includeTopic does not work right if the included document is in syntax 2.0) to the workspace module. - http://git.io/E0JgLg  \n20:15\u00a0<Dan181>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:02\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:21\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
