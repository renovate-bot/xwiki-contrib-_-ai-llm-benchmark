We're working on fixing this.\"  \n23:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it's still true\u2026 until we make FS the default  \n23:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Thanks, I'll add a link to the attachments page.  \n23:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could  \n23:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0add a section about attachments  \n23:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the admin guide  \n23:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and move to it:  \n23:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HAttachmentversioning  \n23:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HAttachmentrecyclebin  \n23:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and more generally eveyrting related to attachments from  \n23:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration  \n23:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Sure. Something to think about, this page is really awkward: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Documentation  \n23:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm indeed  \n23:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was pretty sure there were 3 guides listed  \n23:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but probbaly not  \n23:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to fix that  \n23:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah it's listed below  \n23:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not as a guide  \n23:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: what's wrong with it?  \n23:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Maybe we should have links from each feature to the howtos for developers and admins.  \n23:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've added a quickstart guide since then btw  \n23:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be linked  \n23:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: yes we can do that, I think we're doing it  \n23:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in some places)  \n23:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but not consistently)  \n23:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0What I see (first saw) is like you walk in a to the features section and then you want more information and you go to this tiny page which is like a tight hallway.  \n23:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It should feel like it expands as you look for more information.  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually the info is on XE  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GettingStarted/  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/UserGuide/  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you looked at was platform  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no user guide on platform  \n23:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's not a product  \n23:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes we need to improve all that somehow  \n23:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Well as a user I was looking at platform because I expected to be doing extensive modification to the wiki engine.  \n23:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok as an \"advanced user\" then  \n23:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie 0.1% of users  \n23:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree with you anyway  \n23:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not sure about that. If people are doing research for deciding what to choose they might want to see it all even if they never will make anty changes.  \n23:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well they'll see it through XE  \n23:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since XE aggregated platform + extensions  \n23:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/aggregated/aggregates/  \n23:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes  \n23:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The feature list is very nice, it should be like the foyer and everything should branch from there.  \n23:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0IMO  \n23:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It is very impressive so it's a great starting point.  \n23:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it IS the starting point :)  \n23:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome  \n23:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org  \n23:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless you're talking about XE  \n23:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/  \n23:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/UserGuide/ needs to updated but otherwise it's pretty good  \n23:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I like that http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ explains what XE is  \n23:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm I would put the feature list for XE at the bottom of the front page for XE aswell, the XE front page is a bit spare.  \n23:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure but maybe  \n23:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case i agree that the Getting Started section + user guide page would need some updates  \n23:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and rewording  \n23:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually the first paragraph says \"See the full http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Features for more.\"  \n23:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe not visible enough  \n23:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Either that or make big icons for the different optione IE Features, References, Try it out  \n23:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could have a \"All Features\" button  \n23:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would be visible  \n23:34\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0As it is now, features is as important as the wikipedis definition of CMS  \n23:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n23:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree  \n23:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm thinking a user should go to features, click on a feature they're interested in, read it and maybe at the bottom there is a link for more information which takes them to the admin's guide info on that feature.  \n23:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Some users won't care at all about the admin information on feature A but feature B is a requirement so they will want to read everything they can about it. It seems natural that they should be able to follow a trail starting at the features page and leading to as much information as they can handle.  \n\n"}
