I don't even know what this component does. I guess the only person who could answer is guillaumeD  \n09:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0it allows you to know which is the document that hold the wiki descriptor  \n09:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and I need this to store another object in the wiki descriptor, to hold my own wiki properties  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that as a public component I wouldn't like its name too much but that's another matter ;)  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I don't like Helper as component name)  \n09:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0agreed  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I probably didn't say anything at the tme since it was internal  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guillaume should connect in less than 1 hour  \n09:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0just seeing that we have somehow opposed situation, we allow extending the memory descriptor with wiki groups, but the implementor of the wiki group would need to implement fully his own storage, since the document when we store information is considered implementation detail, and retrieving it is internal stuffs  \n09:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0s/when/where  \n09:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: actually Guillaume is off for 2 weeks  \n11:03\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n11:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n13:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:31\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:36\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:37\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:12\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<OSIMasson2>\u00a0has quit  \n14:58\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:19\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:22\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: didn't realize you had one wiki page unit test at https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/51ed5d0df88a9ca100103e220897a371775bad4b/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-livetable/xwiki-platform-livetable-ui/src/test/java/org/xwiki/livetable/LiveTableResultsTest.java cool :)  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or maybe I did but forgot, redisocvering now)  \n15:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to analyze it at some point to see how to improve the fwk  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now it's probably still too complex to create such unit tests  \n15:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I did a small improvement recently https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/4692437504ab498a661502334c157fab1f196cef#diff-b88d6f9fa8086d801e7d4ad351b4adec  \n16:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but judging from https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-livetable/xwiki-platform-livetable-ui/src/test/java/org/xwiki/livetable/LiveTableResultsTest.java it's not complex  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: you didn't spend too long writing it?  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it took me a while to write the first such unit test on my side  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: that's because you wrote the framework at the same time  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0always hard the first time  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: sure, I mean when taking that out of course  \n16:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I spent some time initially yes, but that allowed me to write a new test now in 5 minutes  \n16:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/51ed5d0df88a9ca100103e220897a371775bad4b  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: don't forget playgroundtemplate  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(see step 8 of http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Migrations#HUpgradeXWiki )  \n16:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0has quit  \n16:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: thanks for the playgroundtemplate reminder.
