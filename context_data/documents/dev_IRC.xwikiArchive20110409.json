Only downloaded the basic installer for evaluation. I'm looking for a wiki, what is possible set up as CMS, so for the guest users are here no \"action buttons\" like topbar and so on. Is here some sort of \"CMS\" skin? (ofc for logged users want a full wiki functionality)... I'm pretty sure than it IS POSSIBLE with xwiki, but i'm wondering that exists this already? (sry for my broken english)  \n12:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The difference between wiki and CMS is how you set your permissions.  \n12:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Without being logged in all you have are some basic action buttons but if you'd like to remove them as well you can either edit the velocity macro files where they are defined or you can hide them with a CSS hack.  \n12:11\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0yes, understand. As i said, im sure than it is possible - i'mwondering than someone developed skins (macros, ccs etc..) already, or will need start from a zero :)  \n12:11\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0There's nothing developed that I know of but starting from 0 isn't that bad when all you want to do is remove stuff.  \n12:13\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0;) ok - thanx for a answer.  \n12:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0sure tihng  \n12:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*thing  \n12:14\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0btw, as i seen, the xwiki is now the BEST free wiki what exists... I'm (as a perl programmer) DREAMING for getting a foswiki to this level... ;)  \n12:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Thanks. I've messed around with perl and the semantics make me want to gouge my eyes out.  \n12:18\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0yes, the %someting{}% is terrible with all $percent escaping and so on... ;) the only problem what i have, that im never coded in java... :(  \n12:18\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0(nor in velocity) - but, it's time to begin.. :)  \n12:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Java is a very expressive language (even more so than C), you need 10 times the code to do what you'd do in any other language.  \n12:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Also we java hackers have a way of using UnreasonablyLongCamelCaseClassNamesWhichEachTellAStory()  \n12:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you can understand javadoc pages and you learn the (like 5) commands in velocity then you're set.  \n12:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \n12:21\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0omg... from a point of view perl programmer (the only lang what i know a little bit) that will be a bit pain.. but nwm - foswiki is unusable for utf8 yet - i havent choice...  \n12:22\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0must RTFM a much - thanx :)  \n12:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You can write in python, groovy and php (you need to add an extension for php)  \n12:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*and ruby  \n12:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Basicly anything for which there's a JSR-223 scripting engine for, you can write into XWiki wiki pages.  \n12:23\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0in xwiki is possible write in python or ruby?  \n12:23\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0wow  \n12:23\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0that is nice  \n12:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That 100MB .exe file isn't all null padding ;)  \n12:24\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0:)  \n12:25\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:25\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0must check perl for JSR-223 (whatever is it) :)  \n12:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0There's a perlish language in JSR-223.  \n12:26\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0np, now reading about jsr-223 \u00a0;)  \n12:34\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:35\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n12:35\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has quit  \n12:49\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n15:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<Chami2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:20\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<chanikag>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:03\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:05\u00a0<mpaun\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<StefanM>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:16\u00a0<StefanM>\u00a0hello world!  \n18:16\u00a0<jomo>\u00a0hi  \n18:32\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:38\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:38\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n18:38\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n18:41\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:47\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<khyati>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:54\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:55\u00a0<khyati>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:08\u00a0<ihalip>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:20\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:35\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:56\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has quit  \n20:09\u00a0<ankur>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:09\u00a0<ankur>\u00a0has quit  \n20:16\u00a0<Chami2>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:27\u00a0<chanikag>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:29\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:35\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has quit  \n21:08\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:12\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:12\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0hey guys. i am kind of new to xwiki, but i have a question  \n21:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yea?  \n21:13\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0i need to create a table in the database  \n21:13\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0how could i mange that?  \n21:13\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0hibenate syntax?  \n21:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0This is for your own stuff not xwiki I assume?  \n21:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0(xwiki creates it's own tables all automagicly)  \n21:13\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0yes  \n21:13\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0for my own  \n21:14\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0i need to have like a registration form to take classes  \n21:14\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0like in a university  \n21:15\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You might find it easier to use the xwiki object/class system  \n21:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But assuming you want to use raw SQL, you can get hold of the hibernate session like this:  \n21:16\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0because i'm new to it, i didn't came up with an idea how could i make it work with object/class system :/  \n21:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0{{groovy}} $xcontext.getContext().getWiki().getHibernateStore().beginTransaction($xcontext.getContext()); session = $xcontext.get(hibsession); {{/groovy}}  \n21:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That should give you the Hibernate session (which is totally internal and unsupported api)  \n21:19\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mar3lis: you can check out http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/DataModel  \n21:19\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Still, I would highly recommend looking at objects and classes as jvelociter suggests.  \n21:20\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0hmm  \n21:22\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0the think is i'm completly not familiar with velocity or groovy, but the task is to use XWiki platform.  \n21:22\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0i've been looking for tutorials with classes and object but there's only few of them  \n21:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Do you know java?  \n21:23\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0a bit  \n21:23\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Then you know a bit of groovy. Almost all java can be executed \\_as\\_ groovy  \n21:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Velocity is simply a subset of java. Many of the more dangerous functions are removed.  \n21:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Is you want to learn about scripting, here's the place to go:  \n21:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \n21:26\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0the thing that bugs me, i don't know how to store the information using classes/objects  \n21:26\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0when a user registers him self to a class  \n21:28\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0create a class with parameters like it would be in a DB?  \n21:28\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0ID, name, etc  \n21:28\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0?  \n21:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0When you're done, what kind of queries will you be running?  \n21:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0get users by class and get classes by user I assume  \n21:32\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0which user is registred to which lecture  \n21:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0so you create a class (actually it should be called structure since it cannot have methods) for a user and add a StaticListProperty which is the names of all classes he's registered in.  \n21:35\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0where could i find more info about how to impliment StaticListProperty and other data models?  \n21:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Each student has their own wiki page and in that page there's a student \"object\" with the static list property. then each lecture has it's own wiki page and in that page there's a object which is the lecture's information (who teaches it etc.)  \n21:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the student object lists the document names of the lecture documents.  \n21:44\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0is it possible to modify the registration form for the whole wiki, when a new user is registered, that automaticly there would be a wiki page created for him?  \n21:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that's already how it works  \n21:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0but yes, you could modify the registration form to add another object to the new user class  \n21:46\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0oh so i could just add ant object with the static list to the profile page?  \n21:47\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0an\\*  \n21:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yup  \n21:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You'd probably do well to read all of xwiki.org documentation and the code for some of the extensions to get a feel for it.  \n21:50\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0ar there any examples on how to use data model properties?  \n21:50\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/DataModel doesnt say much about it  \n21:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0extensions.xwiki.org  \n21:54\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0well thank you a lot. you clearified a lot of things for me  \n21:54\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0i was about to make a simple php/mysql page with registrations forms  \n21:55\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0thank you for now, i'm sure i will be back for some more questions  \n22:17\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0how to show users \"pretty\" name and not the XWiki.FirstUser  \n22:17\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0?  \n22:18\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0with user list property for example  \n22:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0getDocument().getTitle()?  \n22:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's all available from the scripting howto  \n23:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:18\u00a0<drake01>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:23\u00a0<drake01>\u00a0has quit  \n23:31\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n23:36\u00a0<drake01>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:50\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:56\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0in my fresh install i have all these spaces like blog, sandbox, scheduler and xwiki  \n23:56\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0does the wiki somehow depend on them, and if not, how can i get rid of them  \n\n"}
