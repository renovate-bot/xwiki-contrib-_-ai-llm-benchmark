Don't worry 1.0 won't go away before the next major version  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:37): [glerouge] hi sdumitriu  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:37): [sdumitriu] Hi glerouge  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:37): [glerouge] I've been thinking abotu the behavior of title when there's also a heading 1 in the page  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:37): [glerouge] do we currently use a H1 to display the title on the new skin ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:38): [sdumitriu] Yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:38): [glerouge] so if there's a title + a h1 in the page (which will happen since the WYSIWYG generates H1) they will look the same  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:38): [sdumitriu] Yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:39): [glerouge] should we add a specific rule to the H1 that's also the page title to display it a bit bigger ?  \nnpm - (26/08/2009 00:39): hmm so i guess the trick re 2.0 syntax and parseGroovyFromPage() is, logically, to use the same exact trick for hiding the markup, e.g. /\\* Groovy Class Called by [[ts.Analysis2JSON]] {{velocity filter=\"none\"}} #\\* \\*/ [[[code here]]] /\\* \\*# {/velocity}} \\*/  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:39): [glerouge] npm: if it worked for you I guess it's the right solution ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:40): [jvdrean] npm: hum no the trick won't work with 2.0  \nnpm - (26/08/2009 00:40): it just sorta did  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:40): [glerouge] sdumitriu: the filter is gonna look hackish, there are at least 5 different cases  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:41): [glerouge] 1) the page has a title & a header 1 and both are the same 2) the page has a title anda header 1 but they're not the same 3) the page has a title and no header 1 4) the page has no title and a header 1 5) the page has no title nor header 1  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:42): [sdumitriu] But 3 and 5 are OK  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:42): [glerouge] 5) you use the page name as a title I guess ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:42): [sdumitriu] Yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:42): [sdumitriu] The real problem is that the first heading is not easy to find  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:43): [sdumitriu] At least not with the current API  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:43): [glerouge] for 1) and 4) we would have to \"hide\" the heading in the content and put it as a title  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:43): [sdumitriu] We could make extractTitle a public API  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:43): [glerouge] and for 2) we need to fix the style somehow I guess  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:43): [jvdrean] npm: right it works, I've read too fast. It would be great to update the groovy class tutorial with info about making it work with xwiki/2.0  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:44): [glerouge] since it's gonna happen regularly  \nnpm - (26/08/2009 00:44): i guess i can dig the working 2.0 out of the history :-)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:45): [jvdrean] got to go, bye all  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:45): [glerouge] gn  \nnpm - (26/08/2009 00:45): thanks for all the help, it's been great jvdrean (and everybody else too)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:46): [glerouge] npm: our pleasure :-)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:46): [glerouge] npm: don't forget to fill http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SurveyXWikiFeatures  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:47): [glerouge] ricardo: so you got adium working? ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:48): [Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez] glerouge: thanks to your help!  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:49): [Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez] it works fine. But only 1.4b9 allowed me to set up the automatic reconnect.  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:49): [glerouge] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:51): [glerouge] npm: you can vote on only part of the stuff ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:53): [glerouge] lol  \nnpm - (26/08/2009 00:53): { id: \"999997\\_\\_0.0\", label: \"0.0\", type: \"EpisodeEvent\", value: 3 } { id: \"999997\\_\\_12.6\", label: \"12.6\", type: \"EpisodeEvent\", value: 7 }  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:53): [glerouge] not sure what that is, but good luck ;)  \nnpm - (26/08/2009 00:54): part of http://nielsmayer.com/xwiki/bin/view/Exhibit/NPRpods3 :-)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:58): [glerouge] the UI is a bit confusing at first but the feature set is rather nice  \nnpm - (26/08/2009 00:59): yep... it's not how it's going to look in end and i stopped working on that to concentrate on the important part...  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 00:59): [glerouge] ok  \nnpm - (26/08/2009 01:00): when i'm done with what i'm working on, the aforementioned will look different anyways  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:40): [Vincent Massol] does anyone know if thomas is avail today?  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:44): [jvdrean] Vincent Massol: thomas is at a customer but at least for half of the day  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:44): [jvdrean] s/but//  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:44): [Vincent Massol] jvdrean: yep thanks, lucaa has pinged me privately about it  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:49): [Vincent Massol] glerouge: how is http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/UserExperience/ different from the Design space?  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:50): [Vincent Massol] couldn't you have a design item for this?  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:50): [Vincent Massol] (for me the design space was where all our future ideas/work in progress was located)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:51): [Vincent Massol] not that I mind much to have a UX space, it's just add a bit of complexity imo  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:51): [Vincent Massol] when we create a new desing idea we'll need to know whether it's about UX or not  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:51): [Vincent Massol] and in most cases it's really hard to make the diff  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:51): [Vincent Massol] right now you could move at least 30% of the design ideas in UX  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:51): [Vincent Massol] since a lot are about improving the UX  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [glerouge] if you look at it there are no proposals in the UX space  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [Vincent Massol] that's a pb!  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [Vincent Massol] this is not a fait accompli  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [Vincent Massol] it's a proposal  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [glerouge] it's simply a place where to gather UX-related concepts / ideas  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [Vincent Massol] nobody has agreed  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [Vincent Massol] so it MUST be a proposal  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [Vincent Massol] the design space is labelled \"Idea\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [Vincent Massol] it's for ideas  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:52): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:53): [glerouge] I knew you'd have something to say :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:53): [Vincent Massol] just trying to keep xwiki.org clean that's all  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:53): [glerouge] ok, here's what I'd like to achieve, let's see what's the best way to reach it  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:53): [glerouge] I'd like us to agree on a set of guidelines / goals when it comes to UX  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:53): [Vincent Massol] ahah  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:54): [glerouge] so that each time we develop new features they remain consistent with one another  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:54): [Vincent Massol] so you want to propose something  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:54): [glerouge] yep  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:54): [Vincent Massol] just create a UX page in design  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:54): [Vincent Massol] and gather all your stories in there  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:54): [Vincent Massol] later on when you're ready  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:54): [Vincent Massol] you propose it  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:54): [Vincent Massol] (ie send it on the list for approval)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:55): [glerouge] k  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:55): [Vincent Massol] now I'm also fine to have a UX space if that's just to categorize pages (it only depends how many you want to have)  \nxwiki-bridge - (26/08/2009 10:55): [Vincent Massol] what I don't like is to introduce a top level notion of UX  \n\n"}
