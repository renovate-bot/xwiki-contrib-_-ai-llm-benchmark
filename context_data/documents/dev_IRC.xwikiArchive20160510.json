This is probably a good work around. However, I'm using the URL parameters ?format=pdf&pagebreaks=1&attachments=1&includelinks=0&includechilds=6, from the parent page in the page hierarchy, without specifically specifying each pages.  \n14:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I just check the code of the export action and it seems I am mistaken ...  \n14:37\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0ClemensR: I'm trying to use XWiki to maintain the main documentation for a software I will be releasing in 3 weeks. I'd like to be able to export the whole user manual wiki as a PDF book. So far, it looks great, however, the main outstanding issues are that I cannot control the order in which the pages are output to the PDF, and images in the children page are not in the resulting PDF  \n14:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0at least concerning the \"includechildern\" parameter  \n14:38\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, order is only under your control if you add each page with a \"page=...\" parameter manually in the url. this certainly grows large quickly. the code is in templates/pdf.vm on the file system if you like to have a look, too ;)  \n14:40\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0narf, it uses doc.getChildren ... and that is unsorted :(  \n14:43\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0I'd sure like to controbute, and I might. But at the moment, with the software release that close in time, this is very unlikely ;)  \n14:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the code for that is in templates/macros.vm , \u00a0\u00a0#macro(includeChildren $page $withPageBreaks)  \n14:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I wonder if it is possible to patch this quickly, and instead of \"#foreach ($childDocName in $page.children)\" \u00a0\u00a0store $page.children in a lost, use $listtool to sort them and then loop over the list, so at least it is sorte by page name  \n14:46\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0That would be good if I could automatically number pages in a page hierarchy  \n14:46\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0Like 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc  \n14:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that images in subpages are missing is not a known bug, so if you can reproduce this easily it might be worth reporting it in the issue tracker  \n14:50\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0There's an error message concerning the image url not found in the log, let me find it  \n14:51\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0Image not found.

The only issue I see is that the images in the children page are not resolved in the correct context.  \n14:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I wonder if it helps to include the pages in the main page (just for testing if that works around the issue). there you can better control the order of the childern pages ...  \n14:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: did you created the issue from \"PDF Page Export with children does not contain images\" ?  \n14:58\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0ClemensR: what do you mean?  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually as vmassol asnwered in the mail he did created the issue based on your report on the mailing list  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but looks like the jira issue is indeed wrong then  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lanouettea: you should comment on the issue  \n15:00\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0tmortagne: WIll do. Let me register to the Jira... :p  \n15:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but the issue you have sounds like another jira issue specifically about images  \n15:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but cannot find it anymore  \n15:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lanouettea: does the page export well when you export it alone  \n15:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not as a child  \n15:03\u00a0<lanouettea>\u00a0tmortagne: Yes, then the images are displayed  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so indeed probably a context issue like ClemensR said  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[xwiki.org] Restarting xwiki.org again  \n15:07\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: added some explanation at http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-978?focusedCommentId=91378&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-91378  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm still not understanding why sometimes it works (as on jenkins and as on my machine from time to time)  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK the classpath geerated by maven should be deterministic  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*generated  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be a revapi issue too  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for example if revapi was putting the maven classpath into some hashmap)  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: is it random with the same version of Maven ?
