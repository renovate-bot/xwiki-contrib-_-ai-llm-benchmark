I've wired up the new annotations renderer that also handles scripted content in the annotations service and I now have a working prototype.  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [lucaa] I would like to have some sort of playground for it, to have you look at it and tell me what you think.   \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [lucaa] wdyt about creating an annotations.myxwiki.org, and have the annotations prototype setup there?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [lucaa] we could also activate them on incubator and not create the annotations.myxwiki.org especially for this?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [lucaa] (last line without ?, it's a suggestion not a question)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:46): [Vincent Massol] incubator sounds good to me  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [tmortagne] lucaa: +1 for incubator  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:00): [Fabio Mancinelli] lucaa: +1  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:02): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: hmm there's just one pb with aspects for xwiki-bridge.... it's components.txt  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:03): [Vincent Massol] actually it may work right now  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:03): [Vincent Massol] since we don't have other components  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:03): [Vincent Massol] let me try something  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:06): [Vincent Massol] doesn't work... I thought maybe src/main/aspect/compatibility/META-INF/components.txt would get copied but no...  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:07): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: why do you want to use aspects ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:07): [Vincent Massol] because that's our rule  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:07): [tmortagne] bridge module is already separated from the rest of the platform so it ok i think  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:08): [Vincent Massol] and it's much cleaner  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:08): [Vincent Massol] the idea  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:08): [Vincent Massol] is that it shouldn't be possible to use deperecated apis as much as possible  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:08): [Vincent Massol] moving them as aspects helps a lot ensure that  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:09): [Vincent Massol] I think I know how to do it  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:09): [tmortagne] well when it's deprecated you have warning in all EDIs and put them in aspect does not change much  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:09): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: it does  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:09): [tmortagne] not for the user  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:09): [Vincent Massol] the idea showing them doesn't help  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:09): [Vincent Massol] IDE  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:09): [tmortagne] user of the api  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:10): [Vincent Massol] I'm talking about devs  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:10): [Vincent Massol] users will get them anyway  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:10): [Vincent Massol] anyway I d'ont want to rediscuss the rule  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:10): [Vincent Massol] if you don't agree with it  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:10): [Vincent Massol] please make a suggestion on the list to remove it  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:10): [Vincent Massol] and we can revote  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:10): [Vincent Massol] I still think it's a great idea  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:10): [tmortagne] i was just refering to \"it shouldn't be possible to use deperecated apis as much as possible\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:11): [tmortagne] aspect does not make impossible to use deprecated apis  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:12): [Vincent Massol] of course not  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:12): [tmortagne] i'm just saying that since bridge already ahve its own module it's ok if we can't make it aspect because of component.txt  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:12): [Vincent Massol] the only downside I can see with aspects  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:12): [Vincent Massol] is the compilation time  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:13): [Vincent Massol] haven't checked how long it takes but I know it used to take long in the past in some cases  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:13): [tmortagne] yes it's very slow  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:13): [tmortagne] in xwiki-core for example  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:16): [Vincent Massol] ok got it working  \nkaaloo joined #xwiki at 14:08  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:20): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: can you comment on the Model component (the other vote email I sent)?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:21): [tmortagne] reading it  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:23): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: btw I haven't mentioned it but I need Model also to remove a cyclic dep between xwiki-bridge and xwiki-model  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:26): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: i'm not sure to understand exactly what is this vote, why is there \\*DocumentNameSerializer and \\*DocumentNameFactory in it ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:26): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: I could have put 2 separate proposals  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [Vincent Massol] there there because  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [Vincent Massol] with the introduction of Model  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [tmortagne] no i mean why not DocumentName  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [Vincent Massol] we can move them back into xwiki-model  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [Vincent Massol] they are currently in xwiki-core  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [Vincent Massol] because they needed to access xwiki context  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [tmortagne] ho you are specking about the implementations  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:28): [tmortagne] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:28): [Vincent Massol] DocumentName is \\*already\\* in xwiki-model  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:28): [Vincent Massol] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:28): [tmortagne] i did not understood that in the mail (skipper the \"currently in xwiki-core\")  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:28): [tmortagne] \\*skipped  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:28): [tmortagne] well i don't think we need vote for internals but i will comment anyway  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:29): [Vincent Massol] sure  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:29): [Vincent Massol] it's more about Model  \nkaaloo left at 14:34 (\"Leaving.\"  \nkaaloo joined #xwiki at 14:35  \nA-Kaser joined #xwiki at 14:38  \nkaaloo left at 14:39 (Client Quit  \nkaaloo joined #xwiki at 14:39  \nplunden left #xwiki at 14:55  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:15): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: btw we have over 100 deprecation warnings in core....  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:15): [Vincent Massol] (which proves that just having the IDE mention them isn't enough ;))  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:17): [Vincent Massol] we'll need to do something about them at some point  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:17): [Vincent Massol] renaming Model to ModelContext  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:17): [Vincent Massol] if you have a bette idea please let me know asap  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: \u00a0we use \\*Context is several other place i think  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [Vincent Massol] are we?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [tmortagne] in  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [Vincent Massol] I don't recall  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [tmortagne] checking  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [Vincent Massol] ModelContext is slightly misleading though  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [Vincent Massol] since it's not about the model context  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [Vincent Massol] it's more ModelContextManager or ModelContextHandler or ...  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [Vincent Massol] but it's fine with me  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [Vincent Massol] I don't have a better idea  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [Vincent Massol] the idea I had initially  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [tmortagne] well actually we have seral \\*Configuration but maybe not that much \\*Context  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [tmortagne] but it's the same idea  \nxwiki-bridge left at 15:20 (  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 15:20  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [Vincent Massol] hmm I'll commit Model for now and wait for more feedback  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [Vincent Massol] I'll then change it  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [Vincent Massol] devs, please provide feedback  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:26): [anamarias] hi  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:26): [anamarias] What rights would a user need to pick a Gadget from Google Directory for example and transform it into a macro? The macro should be created automatically with one button click  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:27): [anamarias] for example if the Gadget is Google Calendar, the macro created would be called smth like {{GoogleCalendar ... /}}  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:28): [lucaa] anamarias: \u00a0transform it into a macro == pick the gadget from a list and have it transformed into a macro call in the document's source   \nxwiki-bridge - (15:28): [lucaa] or actually create a macro definition, so that the macro is available in the wiki?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:30): [anamarias] to create a macro which you can pick from the wysiwyg insert macro dialog  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:31): [glerouge] lucaa: the second one  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:31): [mflorea] anamarias: if you go with this option (transforming gadgets in macros) then in order for a user to \"import\" a gadget it needs to have the right to create a wiki macro  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:32): [glerouge] and this right will vary based on whether the user is in XEM or XE  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:32): [anamarias] mflorea: so which are those?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:32): [lucaa] anamarias: I think that would be programming  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:33): [glerouge] anamarias: in short, if we do this only admins would be able to turn google gadgets into wiki macros  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:33): [mflorea] not necessarily I think, I should be able to create a small velocity macro without having programming rights  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:33): [mflorea] but I'm not sure  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:33): [lucaa] \u00a0anamarias see this: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WikiMacroTutorial  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:33): [lucaa] \"Wiki macro authors need to have programming rights\" in the prereq section  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:34): [lucaa] and admin != programming  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:34): [anamarias] so, Wiki macro authors need to have programming rights  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:34): [glerouge] mflorea: I think that's what Vincent Massol stuff will let us achieve -> from [xwiki-devs] [Proposal] Wiki macros improvement ideas , every user will be able to create a macro meant to be used only in the current wiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:35): [glerouge] anamarias: yes, right now they do and macros can be defined only in the main wiki of a XEM, but in the future (XE 2.2) they will no longer need it  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:35): [mflorea] it seems so, but there are two different actions: (1) \"import\" gadgets (mostly for admins) (2) add gadgets (already transformed into macros) to the dashbord  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:36): [Vincent Massol] glerouge: \"will\" is not correct anymore since it's been implemented  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:36): [Vincent Massol] ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:36): [Vincent Massol] re PR for wiki macro author it's a bug that asiri is supposed to fix anytime now  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:37): [anamarias] mflorea: yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:37): [Vincent Massol] s/bug/limitation/ since we've known about it from the beginning  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:37): [mflorea] so anamarias, any user should be able to \"import\" a gadget, provided he has write access to the space where the gadget is imported  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:37): [lucaa] [myxwiki] restarting myxwiki to have the annotations running  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:38): [anamarias] mflorea: any registered user or just admins (maybe configurable)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:38): [mflorea] the scope of that gadget will depend on his rights I think (might not be visible for everyone if it's a simple user)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:39): [mflorea] by scope I mean visibility scope  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:39): [anamarias] maybe all the imported macros should be in the same space  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:40): [glerouge] ludovic suggested all MAcros be created in the Macros space  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:40): [mflorea] this way you can control the access to that space and thus who can/cannot import gadgets  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:40): [anamarias] i think it's better like this  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:43): [anamarias] Then how about we have a Macro Directory (to see the \\*imported\\* gadgets and normal ones)? Would that make sense?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:44): [anamarias] to browse separately, in addition to accessing them in the WYSIWYG insert macro dialog  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:45): [mflorea] anamarias: that sounds like good idea. I don't think there is an interface to manage macros inside XE. You can see the list of available macros in the WYSIWYG insert macro wizard, but that's it.   \nxwiki-bridge - (15:46): [mflorea] and to have a way to easily delete/add/edit wiki macros  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:46): [mflorea] i.e. manage wiki macros  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:46): [glerouge] anamarias: yes, it would be good  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:46): [glerouge] right now macros are \"unmanageable\" in the sense that no one apart from their owner know where they are located  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [mflorea] yes, and this can lead to a mess  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [glerouge] having a macro space with a nice homepage listing macros would be cool  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [mflorea] yep  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [glerouge] (same as we do for ColorThemes)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [anamarias] ok, good  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:48): [anamarias] where can I see about ColorThemes? the space&page?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:49): [glerouge] on your local wiki, go to .../view/ColorThemes/WebHome  \nLukemon - (16:37): hm, isn't it a mistake that XWikiDocument#getXDOM is not language aware?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:38): [Vincent Massol] Lukemon: yep there should be a siganture that accepts the language  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:38): [Vincent Massol] (when not specified it's the default language used)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [tmortagne] Lukemon: actually each language has its own XWikiDocument so IMO it's more the XWikiDocument method that takes language which are inconsistents  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: its take the XWikiDocument content, does default language  \nLukemon - (16:47): I'm asking because if I get it right then getRenderedContent is language aware whereas getRenderedContentTitle is not  \nLukemon - (16:48): cause getRenderedContent uses getTranslatedContent and getRenderedContentTitle uses getXDOM  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:50): [tmortagne] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:52): [tmortagne] but the main issue IMO is that the default XWikiDocument is manipulated everywhere instead of the the current language XWikiDocument  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:53): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: btw i did not seen how you handle translation in the new model proposal, maybe i missed something i did not looked closely to what is in the svn, just last commits  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:53): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: what I have committed is not complete  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:53): [Vincent Massol] I haven't put any metadata yet  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:54): [Vincent Massol] (for ex)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:54): [tmortagne] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:54): [Vincent Massol] we'll need to decide if we want it typed + map or just map  \nLukemon - (16:55): Vincent will you create also a new rendering model for this new document model? or the current one will be used?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:56): [Vincent Massol] Lukemon: the rendernig is already new and won't be changed  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:56): [Vincent Massol] I'm talking about xwiki-rendernig/  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:56): [tmortagne] and it's not really related to the document model  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:57): [Vincent Massol] argh...  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:57): [Vincent Massol] /Users/vmassol/dev/xwiki/trunks-clean2/platform/core/xwiki-officeimporter/src/main/java/org/xwiki/officeimporter/internal/splitter/DefaultXDOMOfficeDocumentSplitter.java:53:1: Class Fan-Out Complexity is 21 (max allowed is 20).  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:58): [Vincent Massol] that's because I've added a deprecated method  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:58): [Vincent Massol] which means it introduced org.xwiki.bridge.DocumentName  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:58): [tmortagne] Fan-Out Complexity, my favorite...  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:58): [Vincent Massol] (in addition to org.xwiki.model.DocumentName)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:59): [Vincent Massol] I'll remove the checkstytle test for now   \nxwiki-bridge - (16:59): [Vincent Massol] since asiri put these comments everywhere:  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:59): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0// TODO: This code needs to be refactored along with the xwiki-refactoring module code.  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:59): [tmortagne] boo  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:59): [Vincent Massol] ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:59): [Vincent Massol] the code does look heavy  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:00): [Vincent Massol] with a lot of references  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:00): [Vincent Massol] hey I see this in the pom.xml already:  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:00): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<!--   \nxwiki-bridge - (17:00): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following class has a fan-out of 22 (max 20) which is little hard to fix with the current API.  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:00): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-->  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:00): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<excludes>org/xwiki/officeimporter/internal/DefaultOfficeImporter.java</excludes>  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:03): [lucaa] guys, don't we have a way to get the current page in js?

Now we have the XWiki object, which basically holds all this info (space, wiki, action, et all) and I was wondering whether page is / should be there  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:52): [lucaa] wiki is there too  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:52): [lucaa] below in the file  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:52): [Vincent Massol] I don't see it  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:53): [Vincent Massol] oh  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:53): [Vincent Massol] didn't realize you were talking about some JS Object  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:53): [lucaa] now, q for all, should we use meta tags or XWiki obj for this kind of info?  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:53): [Vincent Massol] maybe wiki is only there in multiwiki mode  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:53): [Vincent Massol] (and that's why I don't see it)  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:54): [lucaa] yes, it's only in virtual mode  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:55): [lucaa] ah, which is pretty bad. It means you need specific js code to handle it when all you need is a reliable doc name... anyway  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:55): [lucaa] q still stands  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:55): [sdumitriu] I'd go for using meta  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:56): [lucaa] sdumitriu: in which case I'd say we drop the if in this (htmlheader.vm):  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:56): [lucaa] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#if($xwiki.isVirtualMode())  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:56): [lucaa] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<meta name=\"wiki\" content=\"$xwiki.getXMLEncoded($doc.wiki)\"/>  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:56): [lucaa] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#end  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:57): [jvdrean] Vincent Massol: I see you've kept labels and inputs separated in your WCAG fixes  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:57): [sdumitriu] K... Why?  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:57): [jvdrean] is it because of http://en.t37.net/implicit-label-bugs-with-ie-6-7.html ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:57): [lucaa] sdumitriu: is that for me?  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:58): [Vincent Massol] jvdrean: No, it's because of WCAG :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:58): [Vincent Massol] the specs says that they should be separated  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:58): [jvdrean] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#forms-labels  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:58): [sdumitriu] lucaa: Yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:58): [Vincent Massol] since several readers don't support them nested  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:59): [jvdrean] Vincent Massol: am I looking at the wrong spec ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl joined #xwiki at 17:59  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:59): [lucaa] sdumitriu: because, for example, I need to build a rest url with wiki, space and page of current document. I'd prefer to just have the wiki of the current doc, even in non virtual mode and not have to handle it myself in the js (if wiki is set then put it otherwise fallback on the default value of 'xwiki'). I just find it a bit cleaner  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:00): [jvdrean] yep http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-WCAG20-HTML-TECHS-20050630/#label :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:00): [Vincent Massol] yep  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:01): [Vincent Massol] so guys I need your input of the naming of Model (see the vote mail about it)  \nSvenDowiu joined #xwiki at 18:22  \nSvenDowideit left at 18:35 (Read error: 101 (Network is unreachable)  \nSvenDowiu is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:07 (\"Leaving\"  \nkaaloo left at 19:17 (\"Leaving.\"  \narkub left at 19:53 (Read error: 113 (No route to host)  \nSvenDowiu joined #xwiki at 20:03  \nA-Kaser left at 20:06 (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)  \nSvenDowideit left at 20:07 (Read error: 145 (Connection timed out)  \nSvenDowiu is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 22:52  \nvenkatesh left at 22:56 (Ping timeout: 180 seconds  \n\n"}
