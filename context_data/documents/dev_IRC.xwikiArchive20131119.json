 \n08:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n08:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same maven version?  \n08:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as before)  \n08:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't check the maven version before each release :)  \n08:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I assume its the same  \n08:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just trying to help you  \n08:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a03.0.4  \n08:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0now  \n08:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but I don't know the previous version  \n08:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be the same  \n08:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I can only assume it's the same  \n08:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you reproduce locally?  \n08:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0how? it's happens when you release, otherwise it can find the snapshot dep to license resources because it was previously build  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0empty repo  \n08:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and it happens on release:perform  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same command line  \n08:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but with dryrun  \n08:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0-DdryRun=true  \n08:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0there's no dry-run for release:perform, only for prepare afaik  \n08:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/perform-mojo.html  \n08:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n08:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ATM I have no clue  \n08:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of what could be wrong  \n08:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless some scp failed above in the logs  \n08:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I gave you the entire log :)  \n08:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and, even locally, it will download the snapshot dep from maven  \n08:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll try with -o  \n08:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise there's a workaround  \n08:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you do mvn clean install on a1 before retrying  \n08:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that won't solve the core issue and it would be good to find out the problemm  \n08:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still reading log  \n08:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed prepare worked so 5.3-m2 should be in your local repo  \n08:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you check that?  \n08:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0prepare doesn't build the entire commons  \n08:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you can see \"skipped\" for almost all modules, but that's normal  \n08:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw you've made our passphrase public with pastebin :)  \n08:19\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally the root pom doesn't use the license plugin so it shouldn't need it  \n08:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the first module using is xwiki-commons-core/pom.xml  \n08:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: root pom is not really the main issue, all jars require license plugin and its built at the end  \n08:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: it should be built just before [INFO] XWiki Commons - Core - Parent POM  \n08:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it should be built before anything that use it but for some reason maven got lost in dependencies  \n08:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I don't know, I would retry if I were you  \n08:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0try what?  \n08:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I reproduce it locally with maven install  \n08:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's built last  \n08:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm?.  \n08:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it fails in an empty repo and with -o?  \n08:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see how it would not fail  \n08:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have the exact same build order than mflorea had on release  \n08:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes me too  \n08:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying with empty repo  \n08:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0can't access jenkins  \n08:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't build  \n08:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but for another reaqon  \n08:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reason  \n08:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying with -nsu  \n08:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's perfectly normal that xwiki-commons-pom requires it, that's what makes all our jars inject the license, this is not done in xwiki-commons-core since this is not only about commons  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where do you see that it requires it?  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's not how it's done)  \n08:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it has a dependency on it  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where?  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see it  \n08:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not because it does not execute it that maven does not validate all dependencies  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see only pluginManagement  \n08:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n08:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and maven is supposed to validate pluginManagement  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it works  \n08:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it can't find it...  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it will not resolve it I believe  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it has always worked  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can even build locally  \n08:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking now my build logs  \n08:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0maven-remote-resources-plugin is not inside pluginManagement  \n08:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it obviously does not work  \n08:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the log Marius got is pretty clear that it does fail and that it's because it could not find the license resource  \n08:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what marius has cannot be reproduced ATM, either on ci or locally  \n08:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what marius has is a license resource build after everything that needs it  \n08:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so no I doubt you can build this this issue anywhere  \n08:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/this this/with this/  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed there's \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<resourceBundle>org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-tool-license-resources:${commons.version}</resourceBundle>  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is not in pluginmgmt  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the question is: how could it work before?  \n08:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well the real question is what changed since the version of maven did not changed  \n08:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki-commons-pom itself does not have any modification since almost a year  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I know  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I changed the order of modules un top level pom  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from:  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<module>xwiki-commons-tools</module>  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<module>xwiki-commons-core</module>  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<module>xwiki-commons-core</module>  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<module>xwiki-commons-pom</module>  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<module>xwiki-commons-tools</module>  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to revert this momentarily for the release  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then find a better soslution  \n08:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the only real change in a while so that must be it  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing the revet now  \n08:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0revert  \n08:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is probably a missing dependency somewhere, like on the resource plugin  \n08:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like we have a dependency on the license check plugin  \n08:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying  \n08:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: done  \n08:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: ok  \n08:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0works well  \n08:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0committing the fix on xwiki-commons-pom  \n08:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: wait  \n08:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd suggest after the release no?  \n08:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or you want to try it?  \n08:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's ask mflorea  \n08:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what he prefers  \n08:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is nothing dangerous here, can only be better  \n08:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I just added a dependency and it build well  \n08:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n08:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0done  \n08:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so now you have double fix, you should be ok :)  \n08:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n08:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n08:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if this fixes it then you need to put back the alphabeitcal order  \n08:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to prove it works  \n08:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and remove my todo  \n08:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I tested before pulling your change but yes it's useless now  \n08:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can do it if you prefer  \n08:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0done  \n08:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n08:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0reviewing all plugins dependencies  \n08:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool we fixed a bug :)  \n08:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0may not be the only missing one working by luck  \n09:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: can I start?  \n09:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: yes  \n09:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0am I the only one getting a 403 on https://github.com/ ?  \n09:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0works now  \n09:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm github does not seems to be in a good shape, the UI at least  \n09:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ssh seems ok  \n09:06\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Good morning  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hello  \n09:13\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0I have a question concerning to the blog  \n09:15\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:26\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0If I create a new blog under /xwiki/bin/view/Blog/Management with blog inside an existing space  \n09:26\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0the blog page is not listet under that space  \n09:27\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0When I click on the new document/page created I see that it is under Wiki Home  \n09:27\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Did I missunderstand the blog inside an existing space function?  \n09:28\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0I though I can create under each Space an own blog which belongs to that space  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Kaisen: I think the multiblog feature isn't really working  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's working well for sure is a single blog per wiki  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0feel free to raise jira issue for problems you find with the multiblog feature  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we were hesitating about removing that feature or finish implementing it  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: any take?  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(having it would be great but I don't know the effort required to finish it)  \n09:35\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0OK so if the subwiki working with restriction I could use ther the blog per wiki?
