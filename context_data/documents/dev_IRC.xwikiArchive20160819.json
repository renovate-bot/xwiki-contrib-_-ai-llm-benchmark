 \n10:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: look at the last comment  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it was not extra clear to me :)  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0adding a comment  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which means we'll still get a lot of users having this issue for a long time probaby  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool that was the only conflict  \n10:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: have you seen http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/3123/console ?  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what's wrong though (haven't checked the lagcy module yet)  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no I did not saw it, looks like a revapi bug  \n11:31\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: is it on purpose that we don't have any redirect from the old snippets pages to the new wiki ?  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I don't remember what I did during the seminar precisely  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(on this aspect)  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0some of those snippets were used a lot and moving them most probably created lots of broken links  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is what I've used: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/ExtensionCode/CopySnippets/  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure there are that many broken links  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes there'll be for sure  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what we can do though now  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I remeber  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no it wasn't on purpose  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I even asked marius  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and he said that by default the redirection was going to be created by the SS  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if I remember corretly)  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we could probably find the snippets that were deleted based on deleted document date  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for $services.refactoring.rename($sourceReference, $targetReference)  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the probleme is that extension.xwiki.org was badly upgraded and was missing refactoring app ( and so redirect class) so no redirection were created  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahhhh  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed it wasn't on purpose  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like you added refactoring app to the xwiki.org flavor but after the upgrade and forgot to fix the wikis  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one thing we need ot discuss  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(quickly)  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is whether we want to conitue with snippets.xwiki.org or not  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ludovic rightly raised some issues about it  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and FTR we'll have similar issues with the recommended extensions vs non recommended ones  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are 3 aspects:  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- snippets  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- extensions  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- reference doc  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we had the 3 mixed before  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which was convenient for users  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm feeling a bit uneasy about the separation of snippets  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we can keep those separated because that's what makes sense in term of properties and UI sheet and have a Solr based page mixing what those 3 have in common (name and summary probably)  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doc.xwiki.org, all.xwiki.org, index.xwiki.org, ....  \n11:59\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<blabla2[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<jihad[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<Craeckie[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reference.xwiki.org (a bit technical) as in reference documentation  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ref.xwiki.org  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since our goal is to have everything as an extension, it makes sense that its goal would be reference documentation  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now not sure snippets can be considered ref doc\u2026 doc yes  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so doc.xwiki.org would make the most sense to me  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tutorials are doc but wouldn't be in there....  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to think more...  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we don't consider it doc but find a synonym for extension  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0add.xwiki.org  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie everything that can be added)  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(add as a shortname of addition)  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah I kind of like add.xwiki.org  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?

 \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@thomas: advertising is 'ad\" not \"add\"  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's very different when you read it)  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0addition.xwiki.org would work too, it's longer to type  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or additions)  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I know it's \"ad\" that's what I said, but it sounds the same  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see the problem person lly  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lunch time, bbiab  \n12:32\u00a0<Chris[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<Craeckie[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<jihad[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<blabla2[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:24\u00a0<M-vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: woudl you like me to look into http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/3123/console ?

But in this case it's not that, the app that is being tested uses the \"Content\" field which has a custom displayer, that doesn't use the edit script service for the moment. It calls directly the GWT macros.  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so it's just temporary that we're still using the GWT editor in the tests; we do plan to upgrade to ck when we get tht iem  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*get the time  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0regarding the error  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can I leave it to you? you seem to know the problem  \n14:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't know the problem :) I just know why the GWT is displayed there. But you can leave it to me :P  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm taking http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/2612/testReport/junit/org.xwiki.test.ui/ViewTest/viewPageWhenSpecialCharactersInName/  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0analyzing http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/lastCompletedBuild/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/testReport/org.xwiki.test.selenium/AdministrationTest/testPanelsAdmin/ now  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems we have now removed the panel name from the class attribute  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to find commit  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mentioning in case it rings a bell to anyone  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone knows whre is that code that generates the <div> for each panel?  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from rightpanels.vm I see it executes $services.rendering.render($panelUix.execute(), \"xhtml/1.0\")  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found it  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/f69af9b1f457157edc4fc52ca9f758cbe22af246/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-panels/xwiki-platform-panels-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/panels/internal/PanelWikiUIExtensionComponentBuilder.java#L111-L111  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah it's #panelheader  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes each panel display itself  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which means they can break the html  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(easily)  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and also decide to to be hidden when needed  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's nice  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you could still break the html even if each panel was not the one displaying itself  \n14:56\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0vmassol I found my issue with my cpu at 100%  \n14:56\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0openoffice caused that  \n14:56\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0openoffice4  \n14:56\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0does it has known issues with openoffice4 and xwiki ?  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well xwiki doesn't support all versions of OO  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's not related to cpu  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's related to succeeding in starting OO or not  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Office+Importer+Application  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(see compatibility section)  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so no I don't know any issue with cpu  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I know  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's stupid\u2026..  \n15:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0boubou: in my experience libreOffice / openOffice server tends to hog the CPU at unpredicteable times and need to be restarted. it shows that this is mostly a desktop application and not a server.  \n15:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0we got monitoring on our wikis that restart the oo-server when it has > 95% CPU for longer than a few minutes; fixes the issue with a kludge  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: this might be a bug caused by your velocity changes  \n15:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I thought there is some xwiki special syntax that caused it, not never found anything reproducible  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what happens is that $paneldoc 's value isn't updated for each panel  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the first panel sets the page name in that var  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then all fruther panels have that page name  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could it be caused by the velocity changes you made?  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't know, Velocity context was not isolated before either so if you execute some Velocity which set a variable you get this variable in following scripts too  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the test was not failiing before so this is realtively new  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(past 34 builds)  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not a flicker)  \n15:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0boubou: me was incorrect. there was an issue where I needed to install a LibreOffice 4.4.4 because OpenOffice crashed (looped with 100% CPU) when exporting a simple table. However that was back in May 2015, and I forgot about that  \n15:09\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0ClemensR then to fix my cpu at 100%, I sould install libreoffice 4.4.4 ?  \n15:09\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0I ask it because this is a options for openoffice in xwiki  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0paneldoc is set in #displaypanel. but that's not used normally  \n15:10\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0libreoffice 4.4.4 and xwiki, is it compatible ?  \n15:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, this or a newer version - it might be worth a try. if you have already a newer version then it is likwely not the issue  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's set in rightpanels/vm too  \n15:10\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0ClemensR I tried the last version of openoffice  \n15:11\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0on xwiki  \n15:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0boubou: yes, a libreoffice 4.4.4 install runs stable for more than a year here. (Actually even a pre-release snapshot of 4.4.4, I never updated it)  \n15:11\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0ok  \n15:11\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0I will try it then  \n15:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but that was for a very very specific issue - can you reproduce your issue? \u00a0Anyway, it is worth a try, even if it is more a shot in the dark  \n15:15\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0I can reproduce my issue with openoffice yes  \n15:15\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0easyly  \n15:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0is it happens with a specific document, and a newer office version does not help, a minimal page to reproduce the problem would be cool.  \n15:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if it happens all the time, no matter what .... it sounds more like a local installation problem, as xwiki + office server works usually  \n15:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I missed the start of the debugging session ... is this the newest XWiki version? If yes I should double check, as I have not tested the office functionality with 8.2.1  \n15:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(no good reason why it could be broken in 8.2.1, but then there is not reason why it should be broken at all \u00a0... it has been introduced quite some time ago and has been stable for some time, too)  \n15:23\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0ClemensR yes sir, the latest 8.2.1  \n15:23\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0how can I troubleshoot the error ?  \n15:23\u00a0\\*\u00a0ClemensR starts its local open office server ....   \n15:23\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0and generate errors in logs ?  \n15:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have to admit that I treat office server as a blackbox - no idea how it works; if it fails, try another version, thats it ...  \n15:24\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0LOL ok  \n15:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0can you produce the 100% CPU when exporting a document as office, or when importing?  \n15:25\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0but you gave me a nice idea to try libre office  \n15:25\u00a0\\*\u00a0ClemensR tries to remember where the office server writes its log files  \n15:25\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0I dont think its happens when I import or export docs  \n15:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you might get slightly better error messages when running the office server in \"embedded\" mode  \n15:26\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0I just restarted the xwiki... wait then... hop cpu 100%  \n15:26\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but I can not recommend to do that in production, just locally for debugging!  \n15:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, so it is likely the search indexer asking open office for the fulltext of office attachments  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: the solr search does not use open office  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it use tika which has it's own way of parsing office documents  \n15:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok then I do not understand what creates 100% CPU load just because XWiki starts  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note to all: the enterprise tests may fail because of the prevoous problems with the context changes by thomas  \n15:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0except if the office server is embedded in XWiki ... then maybe it has trouble initializing, because it tries to read its config from /dev/random or whatever crazy things it might do ;)  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since platform has failed to build , the enterprise tests have not been run again  \n16:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:47\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:33\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:20\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:37\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:14\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:26\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n23:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit\n"}
