Is there a way to obtain the source code for this version? I found only the link to the wayback machine of svnsearch and it seems it's not accessible  \n15:10\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0amack2: uh, oh, this seems to be lost in the mist of time. source code has been migrated to github, e.g.: \u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00a0\u00a0but the actual tag for the 1.9.4 release seems to have been lost  \n15:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think it can be somewhat reconstructed as the commit where the version number in the pom.xml changes to 1.9.4, at least in theory  \n15:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0uh, oh, no, it is on a branch \"xwiki-core-1.9\" which seemingly did not get migrated, unless I am overlooking something (which I often do, however)  \n15:42\u00a0<amack2>\u00a0ClemensR: thanks. Is there something \"close\" to that release? I need only core, the LDAP authentication  \n15:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0amack2: \u00a0propably the closes is the commit where the 1.9-brnach was created: \u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/665205ba2801aa07a65a2dd067e3a627e3e5862a \u00a0I did not check this out to see if the LDAP Authenicator was in the code then  \n15:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0amack2: instead it might be this one here: \u00a0https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/xwiki-authenticator-trusted-ldap  \n15:47\u00a0<amack2>\u00a0ClemensR: thanks!  \n15:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is old enough to have been included in 1.9.4, I think ;)  \n15:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I hope \u00a0I sent you and the right track, as I am not involved long enough to have first hand experience with these versions  \n16:19\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:22\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<amack2>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:46\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n18:14\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n22:10\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
