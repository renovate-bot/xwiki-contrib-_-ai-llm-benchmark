How can i rename the page without special chars and is it possible to forbid using them in the page title?  \n11:08\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n11:09\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0braces in the page title should work without problems  \n11:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess there is a problem with your server configuration. is apache or ngninx in front of it ?  \n11:10\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0its nginx  \n11:11\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0all the other pages are working fine  \n11:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0sigh, I know very little about nginx. \u00a0if you try to access the servlet container directly, does the error still happen ?  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is this a XWiki error or a nginx error ?  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"HTTP Status 500 - Invalid URL\" does not ring any bell so it really looks like some nginx filtering  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like apache filtering URL with encoded slash etc by default  \n11:19\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0basically its a tomcat error, if i access the url \"https://wiki.my-domain.de/xwiki/bin/view/Administration/OwnCloud+Doku+[externe+Leute]\" it get rewritten(?) to http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Administration/OwnCloud+Doku+[externe+Leute]  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this URL does not look right  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0braket are supposed to be encoded  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you writing this URL by hand or is this generated ?  \n11:24\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0i saved the page with the title, and if i click on it and this error appears. I have to say that i recently upgraded from 7.2, maybe something broke?  \n11:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it worked with 7.2 ?  \n11:25\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0i`m not really sure :(  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think it has anything to do with XWiki since it does not looks like XWiki error  \n11:26\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0is there a way to rename that page without being able to access it properly? Maybe that solves my problem  \n11:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, no \"rename page\" snippet on http://extensions.xwiki.org  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0flashdel: you will need to write a script for it, something like http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Clean+slashes+from+document+names  \n11:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, there :)  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can probably copy/paste this script and just modify the part about slash to deal with brakets  \n11:31\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0ok, i will check that  \n11:33\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0it did work \\o/ thank you very much!  \n11:34\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0so is there a plugin which forbids using special chars? or shouldnt that happen?  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWiki is support to support anything, but then tomcat and whatever is in front on tomcat had to support those too  \n11:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0actually it should not happen. currently there is no such plugin  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/had/has/  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:49\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0hello, I would like to modify the default presentation of user settings (right now there are all the available fields: Profile, Preferences, Watchlist, Network, Wikis, My dashboard). Is there a possibility to hide some fields?  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:09\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0@Evi\\_ you can change the profile section easily o the wiki admin, section \"User & Groups\" -> \"User profile\". \u00a0\u00a0I would have to check how to modify the sections; that is certainly possible but has no nice admin UI  \n12:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can edit the page \"XWikiUserSheet\" \u00a0in the \"XWiki\" space - if you edit this with the wiki editor you can see how the sections are put together in velocity code  \n12:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0stuff like: \u00a0#set($discard = $categories.add({'id':'watchlist', 'sheet':'XWiki.XWikiUserWatchListSheet', 'glyphicon': 'eye-open'}))  \n12:34\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n12:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n12:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:42\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n12:56\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0@ClemensR thank you very much for your answer. I see the velocity code of the \"XWikiUserSheet\". May you explain how I can hide, e.g. the id watchlist? Is it done by deleting the lines e.g. #if($isMyProfile && $hasDashboard) \u00a0\u00a0#set($discard = $categories.add({'id':'dashboard', 'sheet':'Dashboard.XWikiUserDashboardSheet', 'glyphicon': 'th'})) #end?  \n12:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is the dashboard :)  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0wachlist should be above starting with : \u00a0#if($isMyProfile && $hasWatch)  \n13:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can also just comment it by adding a '##' \u00a0at the start of the line  \n13:01\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0yes, sorry - anyhow it doesn't really matter for me if it's the watchlist or the dashboard. I just want to figure out how to hide any of the fields. Alright thanks, I will try it by comment the lines out.  \n13:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0commenting out should just work. \u00a0also if just hiding it via CSS would be good enough, you could try a CSS extension, as explained here: \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/SkinExtensionsTutorial\\  \n13:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(mostly talks about JavaScript but works with CSS as well)  \n13:06\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0commenting worked - yeah! :) thank you so much, ClemensR! Made my day. ^^  \n13:06\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0glad to help :)  \n13:17\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:17\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n13:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:47\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0I have another question. This time it is more about asking for a suggestion. I'm setting up user groups and user rights. Would you recommend to give by default all user groups the rights to view and to edit content? Or is it better to give a \"rather untechnical experienced and kind of afraid of new systems group\" just the right to view and maybe to comment content?  \n13:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think of it is a wiki, let everyone edit. you can watch the complete wiki and supervise the changes.  \n13:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0usually the main problem is getting people to participate, not to avoid them doing the too much  \n13:56\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0that's true. I'm just thinking about the \"really technical unexperienced ones\", the more buttons they see the more afraid they are. :D but yeah, the wiki philosophy is that everyone should contribute s.th. to the wiki.  \n14:08\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:08\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:39\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:53\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0Hey, I'm back with another question. :) I'm not sure about the \"right to script\". Based on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting I assume that the user need this right to render marcos, like \"Warning Macro\". Then it would be good to give all users this right, right?  \n16:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0@Evi : nope, you only need the script right to write scripts in macros  \n16:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is somewhat close to \"programming\", and causal users do not need that. they can use other macros like the warning macro without that scripting right  \n16:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is just the five \"programming language\" macros that are affected  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0okay, thx, ClemensR!  \n17:07\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n17:08\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:08\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n17:08\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:37\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:52\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:56\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Hello!
