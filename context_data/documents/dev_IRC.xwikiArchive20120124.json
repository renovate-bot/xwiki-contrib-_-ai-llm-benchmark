Note that these params are passed directly to office server and thus are specific to the office server conversion filters. I searched a while ago for a way to control the image quality on the open office docs, but I don't remember what is the default value. Open Office documentation is a bit cryptic..  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k\u2026 we'll also need to improve the wait for the first time generation with some progress bar  \n13:26\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm even sure I found this in their docs.
