You can pick a project (it doesn't have to be XWiki but we would love to have you around) and it doesn't even have to be an existing project. Any code you write will help your experience and get your name out there.  \n08:10\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That's great that you are interested in working on this.  \n08:11\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0cjdelesle : asiri was intersted in the project and im hoping to do it with him  \n08:11\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0cjdelesle : ill need some help from u too :)  \n08:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Around when do you want to get started working on it and what kind of schedule are you thinking. It would be unfair to expect 10 hour days out of you with nothing but recognition in return.  \n08:17\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0hmm well i have to talk with asiri also  \n08:18\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0i think thats ok, i hope to start asap  \n08:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok, I am trying to get some ground work layed for this project to be built upon.  \n08:19\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0great ok ill get back to u after i talk with asiri :)  \n08:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I have detemined that the DataNucleus Cassandra plugin needs some work before it will be fully functional and I am slowly working on understandign that code base.  \n08:20\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0hmm still the non -indexed problem i assume  \n08:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That is one issue. It \\_should\\_ work even without all columns being indexed.  \n08:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The second issue is that it does not natively support JPQL.  \n08:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0DataNucleus makes adding JPQL support very easy and JPQL is very very similar to XWQL which means adding JPQL support allows us to cheat very badly at XWQL.  \n08:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It should be almost as easy as running it through a regular expression.  \n08:24\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0hmm :) great , hey i have to go got some work :). i will be back in the afternoon :)  \n08:25\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0and ill talk with asiri too  \n08:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok.  \n08:26\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n09:13\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n10:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n10:31\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey guys  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just remembered that today is release day!  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who's doing the 3.1 release?
