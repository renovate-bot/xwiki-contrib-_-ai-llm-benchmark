I improved the doctree perf. Still some glitches but far better  \n18:35\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0so far, it's working almost as expected. my guess is that most of the issue comes from the upgrade 8 -> 9.1.2 but as I wasn't the one doing the upgrade, I have no trace so I can just deal with the result  \n18:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0has quit  \n19:57\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:19\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has quit  \n20:20\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:53\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n21:54\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
