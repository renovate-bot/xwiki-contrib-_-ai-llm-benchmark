(since this is a community farm I don't think we should see that). We do need a contributor or committer group though, I think contributor is better than committer since it's more generic and we have contributors who might need access to incubator without being committers, wdyt?  \nvmassol - (09:56): 2) there's a BadXWikisasgroup on incubator which is also strange  \nvmassol - (09:56): 3) there's a balsamiqmockupeditors group. Shouldn't we merge this with a single contributor group as mentioned in point 1) ?  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 09:57  \nsdumitriu - (09:58): 1 and 2 yes  \nsdumitriu - (09:58): 3, I don't know  \nvmassol - (09:58): ok we can leave the balsamiq grou  \nvmassol - (09:58): if we want to restrict to a space for ex  \ndaning left at 09:58 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \ndaning joined #xwiki at 09:59  \nvmassol - (09:59): (the mockup space)  \nvmassol - (09:59): sdumitriu: now the other question is: what rights do we give to contributors? edit rights?  \nvmassol - (09:59): what about admin rights for importing xars? should we keep this to admins only?  \nvmassol - (10:00): (in this case I'll do the import for bblfish)  \nvmassol - (10:00): it's probably better not to have too many people admins actually  \nsdumitriu - (10:02): +1  \nvmassol - (10:03): btw the add user to group has a display bug  \nvmassol - (10:03): on incubator  \nvmassol - (10:03): when you add someone it doesn't appear in the list (when in the lightbox)  \nvmassol - (10:03): maybe it's becuase we haven't updated the xar  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:09  \nvmassol - (10:11): bblfish: what is the link to the XAR I should import?  \nbblfish - (10:11): ah you have to refresh the page I think  \nvmassol - (10:11): bblfish: you have now edit rights on incubator, use with care ;) (but you don't have admin rights)  \nvmassol - (10:12): what page?  \nbblfish - (10:12): your home page  \nvmassol - (10:12): ah yes  \nbblfish - (10:12): it certainly needs a bit of work on the UI side  \nbblfish - (10:13): a bit of Ajax to change the list of certs would be useful. But I am not an ajax person.  \nvmassol - (10:13): bblfish: ok done  \nvmassol - (10:13): it's all your now  \nvmassol - (10:13): s/your/yours/  \nbblfish - (10:13): ok. It's a one liner  \nbblfish - (10:15): vmassol I don't think I have rights to edit http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiUserProfileSheet  \nbblfish - (10:16): did the war get uploaded to the WebId namespace?  \ntmortagne - (10:16): vmassol: re group UI, it's a bug I reported recently and that has been fixed if i remember well so it probably needs an import yes  \nvmassol - (10:17): yes  \nbblfish - (10:17): I can'f find http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/WebId/CreateCert  \nvmassol - (10:17): tmortagne: ok thanks  \nvmassol - (10:17): it's on incubator bblfish  \nvmassol - (10:17): incubator.myxwiki.org/...  \nbblfish - (10:17): ah ok  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 10:17  \nvmassol - (10:17): this is a farm with lots of wikis  \nvmassol - (10:18): (close to 100 wikis)  \nvmassol - (10:18): incubator is one of them  \nbblfish - (10:21): ah ok. so I would need to edit http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiUserSheet  \nbblfish - (10:22): Edit XWiki.XWikiUserSheet so that the call to XWiki.XWikiUserProfileSheet is replaced by WebId.XWikiUserProfileSheet  \nvmassol - (10:23): bblfish: cannot you do this only for your user?  \nvmassol - (10:23): or for users who want this feature?  \nvmassol - (10:23): (not sure)  \nvmassol - (10:23): unless it's harmless  \nbblfish - (10:23): well the interesting things is to create a community of users  \nbblfish - (10:24): it's harmless. It gives them an rdfa profile page, and allows them to create keys  \nvmassol - (10:24): I'm jsut worried  \nvmassol - (10:24): that we're going to lose any change we brought to xwikiuserprogfilesheet in the future  \nbblfish - (10:24): well then we would need to integrate it into xwikiuserprofilesheet  \nbblfish - (10:25): somehow we have to first allow people to try it out  \nvmassol - (10:25): actually  \ntmortagne - (10:25): or have some extension point for it  \nvmassol - (10:25): a good idea would be to add a user profile tab for this  \nvmassol - (10:25): I don't know how extensible the tabs are jvdrean  \nvmassol - (10:26): can a tab be located in another document for example?  \nbblfish - (10:26): so the html is marked up in rdfa  \nvmassol - (10:26): can it be discovered?  \nvmassol - (10:26): ah  \nbblfish - (10:26): that should remain  \nbblfish - (10:26): I can certainly move the form to create the key somewhere else  \nvmassol - (10:26): there's the rdfa stuff indeed but that could be in another tab right?  \nvmassol - (10:26): all you need is a URL that points to a page with the rdfa tags  \nbblfish - (10:26): the RDFa should be in the profile page really  \nvmassol - (10:26): right?  \nbblfish - (10:26): yes  \nbblfish - (10:27): but it makes sense to have it in the profile page  \nbblfish - (10:27): in the user's home page  \nbblfish - (10:27): that is what is also going to be his OpenId  \nvmassol - (10:27): it would be on the profile page but not in the first tab  \ntmortagne left at 10:28 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbblfish - (10:28): Well I think the RDFa markup is not visible to the user  \nbblfish - (10:28): the public keys can be in a different tab yes  \nbblfish - (10:28): that makes sense  \nvmassol - (10:29): It all depends if we consider your stuff as core stuff or as extension  \nvmassol - (10:29): right now I'm tempted to consider it as extension  \nbblfish - (10:29): well to find that out we have to play with it :-)  \nvmassol - (10:29): since not everyone might need/want it in his own wiki  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:29  \nvmassol - (10:29): especially for internal company wikis  \nvmassol - (10:29): (who don't know anything about rdf)  \nvmassol - (10:29): so extensions sounds best for now to me  \nbblfish - (10:30): yes.  \nbblfish - (10:30): well perhaps this should be tied together with another tool that gives people nice URIs  \nbblfish - (10:30): so that the home page/openid become xwiki.org/p/bblfish  \nbblfish - (10:31): if people want that, then it's likely they are 1. on the web 2. interested in identity  \nvmassol - (10:31): bblfish: FTM it would be http://www.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/VincentMassol?category=foaf or something like that  \nvmassol - (10:31): (tcategory is the id for the tab)  \nvmassol - (10:32): then you can use a short url service on the web to make it shorter  \nbblfish - (10:32): yes for WebId's it does not matter how ugly the WebId is, as the user does not need to see it  \nvmassol - (10:32): till we have such a service built in  \nbblfish - (10:32): it's easy to change, as it's all velocity  \nvmassol - (10:33): jvdrean: you there?  \njvdrean - (10:33): vmassol: yes  \nvmassol - (10:33): how extensible are the profile categories?  \nvmassol - (10:33): are they hardcoded right now?  \nvmassol - (10:34): or can I dynamically add a page with a category object ?  \njvdrean - (10:34): yes they are hardcoded  \nvmassol - (10:34): ok  \njvdrean - (10:34): it's easy to add a tab though  \ndaning left at 10:34 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmassol - (10:34): jvdrean: you have a plan for having extension points?  \nvmassol - (10:35): jvdrean: the need is to add a tab without touching the page  \nvmassol - (10:35): (otherwise you need to perform a manual merge whenever you reimport the default XAR)  \nvmassol - (10:36): so this can be done either through IX or through custom Objects  \nvmassol - (10:36): the mythical IX :)  \njvdrean - (10:36): I have no precise plan, it could be done with both methods  \njvdrean - (10:36): I wanted to make a proposal with objects but I missed time  \nvmassol - (10:36): ok  \nbblfish - (10:39): vmassol: you could do the change now, tell people to use it, and ask for feedback and ideas  \nvmassol - (10:39): bblfish: what change?  \nbblfish - (10:39): I suppose that is what the incubator is for  \nvmassol - (10:39): the pb is that people need local users for this to work  \nbblfish - (10:39): replacing the user sheet with mine  \nvmassol - (10:40): we're all using farm users  \nbblfish - (10:40): local users?

 \nbblfish - (10:43): close?  \nvmassol - (10:43): so we'd only address xwiki contributors who have admin rights on incubator  \nvmassol - (10:43): closed?  \nvmassol - (10:43): s/closed?/closed/  \nbblfish - (10:43): ok  \nvmassol - (10:43): the pb is your experiment is an open experiment  \nvmassol - (10:44): hmm  \nvmassol - (10:44): we could create a subwiki for this  \nvmassol - (10:44): just for this I mean  \nvmassol - (10:44): it's easy to do  \nvmassol - (10:44): and we'd leave it open for registration  \nvmassol - (10:44): bblfish: what do you think about bblfish.myxwiki.org?  \nbblfish - (10:45): rather webid.myxwiki.org  \nvmassol - (10:45): ok  \nvmassol - (10:45): was thinking you could use it for other stuff  \nvmassol - (10:45): but ok fine for webid  \nvmassol - (10:45): creating it  \nbblfish - (10:45): well with bblfish  \nbblfish - (10:45): it's a bit personal  \nbblfish - (10:47): but otherwise the tab solution would do too  \nvmassol - (10:47): but it's different  \nvmassol - (10:47): here the pb is that incubator is not open for registrzation  \nvmassol - (10:47): registration  \nvmassol - (10:48): so users cannot try your work  \nbblfish - (10:48): ah yes  \nvmassol - (10:48): give me 1 mn  \nvmassol - (10:48): and you'll have your own wiki :)  \nvmassol - (10:50): bblfish: done: http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/  \nvmassol - (10:50): you're the owner so you have all rights  \nvmassol - (10:50): you can edit anything  \nvmassol - (10:50): you can modify the home page to explain the experiment we're doing  \nvmassol - (10:50): modify the profile sheet  \nvmassol - (10:50): etc  \nbblfish - (10:51): ok  \nvmassol - (10:51): then you could send a mail on the users/devs list to explain the experiment and what users can do with it maybe?  \nvmassol - (10:51): then we can tweet about it, blog it, etc :)  \nbblfish - (10:51): yes. ok. good idea  \nvmassol - (10:51): invite people to try it  \nvmassol - (10:51): you can change the color theme to suite your taste too ;)  \nlucaa left at 10:55 (Quit: Leaving.  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 10:59  \nbblfish - (11:19): how do I get my profile on webid.xwiki.org to be on \u00a0webid.xiwki.org and not on xwiki.org?

I mean for external URLs there's no problem, but what if you want the image to be packaged together with the macro?

The best way to see what's going on is to monitor HTTP requests to check what is actually sent\u2026 Btw, what's the URI you're GETting?  \nlucaa - (15:50): well, my reader falls back on the HttpRequest parameters if there is no body (I've found this technique somewhere in the xwiki-core-rest), so that's how it ends up parsing the query right from the query parameters  \nlucaa - (15:51): but my question was rather why exactly is it calling a messagebodyreader to prepare the @Get method parameters. It's good for me, it does the job, but I was just wondering how realiable this is  \nfmancinelli - (15:56): lucaa: Well, I don't have a precise answer because this is something that happens behind the RESTlet scenes so if it works it should be ok. Maybe the query parameters are made available seamlessly to the code you wrote in your reader (i.e., query parameters + form urlencoded parameters are accessed in a uniform way through the api)  \nfmancinelli - (16:01): lucaa: I mean, since you don't have a body in the GET request, the values you put into your AnnotationRequest object have to come from the URI parameters  \nlucaa - (16:01): yes they do, I do parse them from there  \nlucaa - (16:01): (04:51:55 PM) lucaa: well, my reader falls back on the HttpRequest parameters if there is no body (I've found this technique somewhere in the xwiki-core-rest), so that's how it ends up parsing the query right from the query parameters  \nlucaa - (16:02): the only thing I'm slightly worried about is the actual call of the reader before the @get method  \narkub joined #xwiki at 16:03  \nfmancinelli - (16:04): lucaa: why?  \nlucaa - (16:05): because a @get request doesn't have a body (well, has a void body) and the reader is supposed to read a body  \nlucaa - (16:06): however, if I can use the @get annotation for a method with a non-annotated parameter, I assume the reader is the one to build that parameter...  \nlucaa - (16:06): what i'm wondering is if it's the standard or just the restlet impl we're using...  \nfmancinelli - (16:07): lucaa: The reader is called because you put a non-annotated parameter in the @GET method. If you remove that and you use @QueryParam annotated parameters, you will be able to retrieve the query parameters and avoid to call the reader.  \njvelociter - (16:08): vmassol: tmortagne I've been surprise to see that newly created document generate a \"DocumentSaveEvent\" and not a \"DocumentCreatedEvent\"  \njvelociter - (16:08): I don't understand the wording choice  \nlucaa - (16:08): I know I know, so as long as I can put a non-annotated param for the @get, I guess it's fine and it's not implementation dependant  \nvmassol - (16:08): jvelociter: me neither  \ntmortagne - (16:08): jvdrean: there is no such things as DocumentCreatedEvent and you should ask sdumitriu i did not defined the first events ;)  \njvelociter - (16:09): tmortagne: I'm just talking about the name choice  \njvelociter - (16:09): I know it does not exists  \nfmancinelli - (16:09): lucaa: AFAIK the spec doesn't forbid that so it should be fine  \ntmortagne - (16:09): (and yes DocumentCreatedEvent woul have been better)  \nlucaa - (16:09): fmancinelli: yes, I was just reading that now  \ntmortagne - (16:10): s/jvdrean/jvelociter/  \nvmassol - (16:10): yes I get caucght by this all the time  \njvelociter - (16:10): I should login as jerome  \njvelociter - (16:10): :)  \nvmassol - (16:10): jvdrean and jvelociter, get your act together and stop using the same initlas!  \nvmassol - (16:10): initials  \nvmassol - (16:10): :)  \njvelociter - (16:10): one of has to get married and take his wife name  \njvelociter - (16:11): BTW we need to refactor the event filters to work with document references, wdyt ?

 \nvmassol - (16:24): (I thought fabio said it wouldn't work?)  \nfmancinelli - (16:37): vmassol: I think she's doing it with new components packaged in jars  \nlucaa - (16:39): vmassol: yep, I did add my new annotations specific resources without any change to the xwiki-core-rest  \nlucaa - (16:39): as components, packaged in jars  \nvmassol - (16:42): cool that's what I imagined before but I thought it was not working  \nvmassol - (16:42): I probably misunderstood what fabio said  \nvmassol - (16:42): fabio: didn't you say that compoennts are initialized once at app init time?  \nvmassol - (16:42): (rest resource components)  \njvelociter - (16:43): vmassol: what probable does not work is to programmatically add new resources  \njvelociter - (16:43): anca added jars  \nvmassol - (16:43): jvelociter: ah right  \nmflorea - (16:43): tmortagne: I see that macro name is case sensitive, while macro parameter names are not. is that something you agreed on?
