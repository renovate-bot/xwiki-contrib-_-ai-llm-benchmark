Then I must plaing with style and content maybe  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want to change that, you'll need to use a custom skin and override titlevars.vmvm  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no style in titles  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's parsed as plain text  \n10:22\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0\\* playing  \n10:22\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#set ($titleToDisplay = $tdoc.getRenderedTitle('xhtml/1.0'))  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from titlevars.vm  \n10:23\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I will check titlevars template  \n10:23\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ha yes right  \n10:23\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0thxs again :)  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR this is where it happens: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/43235afcd791de4d504e3e71ebfc35650a06b79d/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-display/xwiki-platform-display-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/display/internal/AbstractDocumentTitleDisplayer.java#L199-L199  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw it seems our javadoc is not correct :(  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing it  \n10:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0humm maybe it is \"dangerous\" if I modify $titleToDisplay (I wanted this particular title for only one page)  \n10:26\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0if a user typing some \\* and /// character in title by example  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reason we did this is because we display the titles in lots of places  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like document tree, breadcrumbs, index, etc  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and having styles there do not make much sense  \n10:27\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes of course  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also preventing mistakes yes  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically we wanted the title to never fail  \n10:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I will think about it (or propose another solution at my boss)  \n10:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0:-D  \n10:33\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Finally in footerglobal my colored title is probably... nicer and pretty ;-) Thxs  \n10:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n12:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm weird, I'm having problems opening a page on exo in object editor mode  \n13:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works fine in inline mode but but doesn't work in object editor  \n13:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0keeps waiting  \n13:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0something seems to be blocking it  \n13:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could someone try http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/Extension/IRC+Bot+Application?editor=object  \n13:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?

 \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're doing it in 2 steps maybe?  \n13:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it builds for me, otherwise I would have upgraded to 2.8  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with java8?  \n13:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, with java 8  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah cool  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wati  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not the issue  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02.6 also does  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it needs to work with target and source set to 1.8  \n13:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0check the commit, I remove the change you introduced in the pom  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you tested that?  \n13:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0isn't target and source set to 1.8 by default in our build now?  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're still have it set to 1.7  \n13:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0where?  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the GWT plugin is one of the blocker  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0top level pom  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in commons  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we had clirr as a blocker but I fixed it, now we need to fix GWT  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then we can move to 1.8 :)  \n13:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0then why did you do https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/6d4eb285832b70b6e73f52187c4711fe2087f973  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becuase 2.6.0 was not build with java 8  \n13:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*building  \n13:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sure, but if we still have 1.7 in commons,why change the plafform pom?
