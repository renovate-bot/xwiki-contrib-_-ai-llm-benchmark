I was more interested in toolmaking.  \n12:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, our university is a lot about that  \n12:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but i always wanted to be more of a management guy  \n12:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Metal is rather funny at when you begin to really care.  \n12:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so the other direction seemed to be the better pick for me  \n12:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh metal is just fine compared to some other stuff  \n12:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0at least solid metal  \n12:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like, have you ever heard about \"foam metals\"? dunno if this is the proper translation, though  \n12:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0<-- very limited experience.  \n12:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes, heard about them.  \n12:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the basic idea is to have sort of a metal sponge  \n12:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Aluminum sponge.  \n12:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0which is a lot lighter but almost as hard as regular metal  \n12:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0And oil soaks through them...  \n12:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that shit is wicked engineering and science  \n12:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0not necessarily  \n12:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I remember discussion about bearings which oil could seep through.  \n12:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Probably not a very good idea for the load on bearings but it was just discussion.  \n12:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh, it really depends, to be honest. it depends on what kind of bearing you need. what the sorrounding is like, how much the load is and so forth  \n12:21\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0WDYT about small home CMC mills and free gcodes?  \n12:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i had to learn all that stuff... not too much fun if you don't care too much. although it was all rather interesting at the end  \n12:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what's that?  \n12:21\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*CNC mills.  \n12:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Just the idea of everyone having a mill and codes being passed around like free software.  \n12:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i don't know about that concept... in fact, i am still trying to figure out a good translation for mill that makes sense to me ;)  \n12:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0milling machine.  \n12:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, i think i know what you mean now... at least the mill part... but what about codes`  \n12:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0(Bridgeport)  \n12:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0?  \n12:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0G01 x123 y456  \n12:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The output from mastercam  \n12:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0What makes the mill seek to each location.  \n12:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0you mean all the coordinate system business in CNC programming?  \n12:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, i think it's really interesting and i might be taking some classes in that next semester  \n12:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That's the on.  \n12:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but i am not a hundred percent sure about it. i think the programming could be very neat  \n12:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code  \n12:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but the classes i'd be taking are rather about the electronics concerned  \n12:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It's \\_almost\\_ assembly.  \n12:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yep. well, never had too much of a look into that... only did some rather basic machine programming in one of my internships  \n12:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Basic idea is don't send the part, send the codes.  \n12:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but that was just random commands with offsets, spaces between punches and patterns... so rather for the employee out in the factory  \n12:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, there are a lot of different implementations of machine programming these days  \n12:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0especially since you can already do a lot with end user software and only need to transfer it to your machine at the end of the day  \n12:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^mastercam  \n12:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so i think stuff like g-code will become more or less obsolete or will be enhanced to do a lot more  \n12:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mastercam meaning a camera that retrieves points to go to?  \n12:29\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://www.mastercam.com/ Hugely popular program for computer aided manufacture.  \n12:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, it's some sort of CAM program...  \n12:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, like i said, i never went much into that direction. had a class where they spoke about all sorts of CAx software. but they never went much into the specifics  \n12:30\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Draw the part in autocad, copy into mastercam, plot the toolpath, set speeds and feeds, set offset for tool diameter ---> gcodes come out.  \n12:30\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anyway, since DassaultSystemes and PTC are now the markets leaders in CAD and they also produce lots of other CAx software, i think many of the smaller/older products will disappear  \n12:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh solid edge. That's a name I know.  \n12:31\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0solid edge? sure you don't mean SolidWorks?  \n12:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes. Maybe it's an older name.  \n12:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0how long ago have you been into that kind of studies?  \n12:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Doubt autodesk \\* is going anywhere. Different products for different jobs.  \n12:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0just to get a frame?  \n12:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Graduated highschool class of '06. This was highschool that I was in this class.  \n12:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, autodesk is still good for small and medium sized companies... they have cheaper products and reasonable usability  \n12:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh, well, i graduated from school in 07 but i never cared about anything like that until i entered university in 07  \n12:34\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I did a couple engineering classes in college but college costs $$ and school loans are really dangerous IMO.  \n12:35\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0good thing about Germany - we don't have to pay in many of the states for university  \n12:35\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and the money i need for my flat, food and thelike was already saved up by my parents  \n12:36\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0Is it possible to query all docs within a certain class for a specific value even if you don't know the field name?  \n12:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0saved up sounds wrong... anyway ;)  \n12:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0documents \"within a class\"  \n12:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0?  \n12:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Do you know the name Starrett?  \n12:37\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what's that?  \n12:37\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the company?  \n12:37\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0I mean documents based on class  \n12:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Ahh then that's a no. Measuring tool manufacturer.  \n12:37\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0containing objects  \n12:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Finding all documents which contain objects of a given class.  \n12:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0no, our measuring professor was more into other companies  \n12:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like Mahr  \n12:38\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0cj: no, find all documents of a given class where any property has the value foo  \n12:38\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0and then retrieve the property name if the value is set to foo  \n12:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ok by that you mean: find all documents which contain objects of a given class...  \n12:39\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0yes  \n12:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0How are you querying? HQL or XWQL?  \n12:39\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0I'm not querying at all atm, just wondering if it is at all possible  \n12:40\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0yes  \n12:42\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0basically the thing is they want something like the page here https://wiki.noiv.nl/xwiki/bin/view/GemAppTest/Haarlem but then sometimes, some of the data in the table should be able to have multiple values (so CMS can have three options, etc)  \n12:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0select doc.fullName, obj.className, obj.number, prop.name from XWikiDocument as doc, BaseObject as obj, StringProperty as prop where prop.value = 'foo' and prop.id = obj.id and obj.name = doc.FullName and obj.className = 'My.CustomClass'  \n12:43\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0excellent, thanks  \n12:43\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Off the top of my head, if it works with no tinkering then I am having a good day.  \n12:43\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0hehe  \n12:43\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0s/good/AWESOME/  \n12:44\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0customer decided to respec what they wanted when the work was done, ugh  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder why we had a sudden increase in remediation cost around the 18th of dec 2010: http://nemo.sonarsource.org/plugins/resource/178313?page=com.sonarsource.sqale.ui.dashboard.SqaleDashboard  \n12:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0Menso: that's how things work! you wouldn't believe how much stuff we respecified in our PDM project since the initial meeting  \n12:46\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but it's not all our fault... i think the consultant should have been more insistant on discussing the specs  \n12:46\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0jstoldt: true, but their current wish is essentially impossible ('we want to assign the same object different values on the same page, so x should be Y and Z at the same time!)  \n12:47\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0So I'm going to try to make it all variable and see if I can string the different objects and their values together and then still query everything  \n12:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, to be able to do that you need something to set a flag that tells you wether it's y or z, won't you?  \n12:49\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0Look at https://wiki.noiv.nl/xwiki/bin/view/GemAppTest/Haarlem  \n12:49\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0What they want is to sometimes be able to add an extra 'cms' row to the table or an extra 'VOiP' or 'CRM'  \n12:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i see  \n12:50\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0if I make the functions pickable from a list too I can then use a query to see what field contains what values and match the field name \"row1\\_package\" with \"row1\\_status\" or \"row1\\_supplier\"  \n12:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yep  \n12:59\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0does velocity have something to check a string for contents?  \n13:00\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, you can use the java string functions  \n13:01\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0ah cool, so when I know row\\_02\\_status is bar I can detect the row\\_02 in it and find the corresponding row\\_02 fields because I know what they're called  \n13:02\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If you're doing a db query you can do the same with \"and prop.value like 'beginWithThis%'\"  \n13:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i don't know what you are trying to say but i know the string stuff works ;)  \n13:02\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0% is a wildcard in db queries.  \n13:04\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:06\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0jstoldt: well if I make the table on https://wiki.noiv.nl/xwiki/bin/view/GemAppTest/Haarlem completely variable I still need to know certain properties for each row, so if I query for the value 'CMS' which I find in row\\_03\\_apptype I need to be able to extract the fact that that is in row\\_03 so I can show the row\\_03\\_status and row\\_03\\_supplier along with it  \n13:06\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, okay  \n13:07\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0because those are linked to whatever is filled in in row\\_03\\_apptype  \n13:08\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0not sure how to otherwise do this in xwiki, in a db I would just add another row with a unique ID called 'CMS' too and display all the fields that contain CMS :)  \n13:47\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n13:57\u00a0<ggueneau1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:04\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think i found a bug  \n14:04\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, so the setup is this: tomcat 7, windows 7 x64, XWiki 2.7 final  \n14:04\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0LibreOffice 3.3 RC1  \n14:05\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0using the Office Viewer macro fails on a page that goes by the name \"Verschmelzungs- Vererbungs-KE\" but works on \"Verschmelzungs Vererbungs KE\"  \n14:07\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think the problem is that in the image links the dashes are replaced by %2D  \n14:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0also, i noticed that that there is no way to restore deleted attachments from the bin  \n14:14\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:14\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\"no way to restore deleted attachments\"?  \n14:14\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Oh you mean when the filename has a - in it?  \n14:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0nope, filename only has dots as seperators  \n14:15\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0What happens when you try?  \n14:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but in the document index on the deleted attachments tabs there is only the red X on the right of each line  \n14:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0not the green arrows  \n14:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0So this is a UI level problem not storage?  \n14:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i tried this: went to Sandbox.TestPage1, uploaded Axels.Punkt.Einstellungen.png, deleted the file, went to document index, clicked on deleted attachments  \n14:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yep, i figure it's UI  \n14:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0unless there is a lack of underlying functionality which prevents anyone from implementing it in the UI  \n14:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The function should be there.  \n14:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0heh if it's unused then my job is a lot easier refactoring attachment storage.  \n14:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hehehe, i think you are mistaking a bug for an opportunity ;)  \n14:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I made a few changes to attachment storage and it's old code which I don't like working on. Right now I'm doing a rewrite of attachment storage which should make the code much nicer.  \n14:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0is it related to be able to store the files in the filesystem rather than the database?  \n14:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because i think that would be a real improvement  \n14:21\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That's the one.  \n14:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i mean a really big one  \n14:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But there are a million \"what ifs\" because a filesystem is essentially a thread unsafe transactionless database.  \n14:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, that's true  \n14:22\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anyway, i like your approach to actually make it a file system  \n14:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It was needed.  \n14:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i know PTC Windchill only stores the files with a number as the name and then keeps track of the file in the DB  \n14:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/contrib/sandbox/xwiki-store/xwiki-store-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/store/FileSaveTransactionRunnable.java  \n14:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm pretty proud of the code in that file.  \n14:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0specifically onRollback()  \n14:23\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0ce femeie =))  \n14:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0:)  \n14:24\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0wrong window :))  \n14:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0this file also shows me what i hate about java... you never see files with a couple of thousand lines of code  \n14:24\u00a0<+florinciu>\u00a0busted! :))  \n14:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0;)  \n14:24\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0:))  \n14:25\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0it's hard when you're on 3 IRC Networks :))  \n14:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\"never see files with a couple of thousand lines of code\" sooo easy to make a huge mess out of a file that big.  \n14:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sburjan`: only if you don't use two for xdcc'ing ;)  \n14:26\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I only xdcc from one of them.. but also other things :)  \n14:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0;)  \n14:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cjdelisle: true, but i like classes that are a little bigger but contain a more complete set of functions that all belong to one meta object  \n14:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I like functions.  \n14:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0C == no state.  \n14:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like in eMule's code you got PartFile.cpp with more than 2000 lines of code and anything related to downloads from a file point of view is present in that file  \n14:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0unless you are a horrible coder and use global variables everywhere.  \n14:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh, global variables are messy, imo  \n14:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Well... XWikiDocument is 7000 lines and anything related to anything is in there...  \n14:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0nice! that must be the only file this big. because any other file i checked out thisfar was just a couple of comments along with three lines of code :-P  \n14:30\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0There are a couple other big ones, nothing that big though ---> code I really don't like working on.  \n14:30\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0btw, are you with the paris office?  \n14:31\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0or somewhere entirely else?  \n14:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm in the Massachusetts USA office :)  \n14:31\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and working fulltime on xwiki, though?  \n14:31\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0who's paying for that? or do you work as a consultant?  \n14:32\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0cjdelisle: we should consider breaking that class into smaller one .. but this requires very much work  \n14:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I guess I'm a consultant. Full time until attachments are done.  \n14:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, i see  \n14:33\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0so after finishing with attachments you won't be so active ? :)  \n14:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0More like \"every waking hour\".  \n14:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0come to think of it, you are planning to make some code that allows transition from the 1.x-2.x DB scheme to the 3.x FS scheme, right?  \n14:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Should be automatic transitioning.  \n14:34\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If not found in FS, check DB.  \n14:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so you are not planning to shrink the DBs by pulling all the attachments out of there and adding them to the FS?  \n14:35\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0cjdelisle: so after all, all attachments will be held separately ... and NOT in the DB ?  \n14:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Only on delete because it's dangerous to start removing things from the DB.  \n14:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0correct.  \n14:35\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0why is that?  \n14:36\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I guess so we can support large attachments and don't choke the db  \n14:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0why is what?  \n14:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0dangerous to start removing things from the DB?  \n14:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0why is it dangerous to delete stuff from the DB  \n14:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0^^  \n14:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Suppose you do a load from the db and it's a low quality db engine (not saying any names but it's initials are MyISAM) and it fails halfway through and silently?  \n14:37\u00a0<ggueneau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Pull to file, delete from db, have half an attachment, pwnd.  \n14:38\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0owned :)  \n14:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It'd be easy enough to write up a groovy script to move everything over. IMO that's the better way because in that case an admin will be watching.  \n14:39\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, just as a disclaimer, i am really not much into the DB business, anyway, what i'd imagine would be something like \"load attachment (versions) and save them to disk, verify them and then delete them from the DB\"  \n14:39\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0exactly, that was something i was thinking about  \n14:39\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but why should we have attachments in the db in first place ?  \n14:39\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0or make some import document in the default .xar with a \"hit me\" button that triggers the job...  \n14:40\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sburjan`: that's how it is now, i understand  \n14:40\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0i know, now yes.  \n14:40\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0this is why it would, imo, be an improvement to make maximum use of the new attachment storage cjdelisle \u00a0is working on  \n14:40\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but in the future .. we'll keep existing attachments in db for backward compat ?  \n14:40\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0One advantage of storage in a VARBINARY is you run mysql\\_dump and you have everything.  \n14:40\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0my point...  \n14:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true  \n14:41\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Not worth the costs though IMO.  \n14:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yep  \n14:41\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0we could include the extraction fron db into the FS in the Migration procedure we are preparing  \n14:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, something like that...  \n14:41\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0if someone upgrates from an older version  \n14:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, probably better as a manual task, though  \n14:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^+1  \n14:42\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0you know better, this is not my area yet  \n14:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0manual task with an easy to use interface, some logging and prolly some options to choose only chunks for one go at a time  \n14:44\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I have 4k lines of code here mostly for handling every possible case. I don't even want to imagine the possible failure modes doing silent automatic conversion with deletion.  \n14:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the last bit, i imagine, would be good to stop the server from freezing on large DBs for lengthy times  \n14:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah... btw, the storage uses file hashes, right?  \n14:44\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0or make conversion somehow atomic  \n14:45\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^ Massive amount of code  \n14:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because when doing anything of conversion i think doing a hash compare between db file and fs file would be something important to ensure data quality  \n14:45\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0work/storage/xwiki/Main/WebHome/~this/attachments/30579.jpg/30579.jpg  \n14:45\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^that's my current proposal.  \n14:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0despite the cost in CPU time  \n14:46\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, i read about it in the mailing list, i think  \n14:46\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0why do we need the ~ ?  \n14:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Hashing is cheap. Interesting idea.  \n14:46\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sounded reasonable to me  \n14:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0~ is URL invalid and everything else is URL encoded.  \n14:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Imagine nested spaces.  \n14:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Then imagine you made a document called:  \n14:47\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0nested spaces ?  \n14:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, if you hash some hundreds of mega bytes of data twice it might still be a lot of cpu time  \n14:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0xwiki:Main.WebHome.this.attachments.30579\\.jpg.30579\\.jpg  \n14:47\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0pe net  \n14:47\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0wrong windows again :)  \n14:47\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0\\*window  \n14:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0You get a collision.  \n14:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0~this makes the collision impossible.  \n14:48\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Remove ~this and it will be impossible without nested spaces and improbable with them.  \n14:48\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I don't understand the concep of nested spaces  \n14:48\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0You have a space called Main  \n14:48\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0\\*concept  \n14:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0inside of that you have a space called Another.  \n14:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Inside of that a document called WebHome.  \n14:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The fullName is xwiki:Main.Another.WebHome  \n14:49\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but afaik we don't have nested spaces atm  \n14:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0correct. without using \"~this\" we would close the door on adding them in the future.  \n14:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0(Or accept a collision bug)  \n14:50\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but do we want this in future ?  \n14:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it is a desired feature.  \n14:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, for as long as we don't run into path length problems it should be reasonable... come to think of it, are you going to store the entire file name or only abbreveations and keep the complete file name in the DB?  \n14:51\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The collision may have security implications esp. if other data is placed in the same hierarchy.  \n14:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0by we i mean you, obviously ;)  \n14:51\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^you have a say in the matter.  \n14:51\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:52\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Entire file name will be stored (by my current code)  \n14:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i know, just saying ;)  \n14:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i was thinking about rather long file names and rather long paths... i know it's problematic on older filesystems  \n14:53\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^dos  \n14:53\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0cjdelisle: and the dir structure will look something like browsing with WebDav ?  \n14:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0since the .zip standalone runs on any stick it could happen on stick installations of XWiki  \n14:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0which would be unfortunate for people using that  \n14:54\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0stick = usb stick  \n14:54\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I looked into different filesystem characteristics and all I saw that are reasonably new supported 255 char filenames.  \n14:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0usb --> fat32 IIRC. That shouldn't be too much of a problem.  \n14:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Bigger problem is constant writes to the flash which will ruin it.  \n14:55\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true  \n14:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think usually it's really FAT32 but i remember faintly to have seen FAT16 flash drives at some point not too long ago  \n14:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0might have been some mp3 player, though  \n14:57\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I think even then windows will make a conversion table aka PROGRA~1  \n14:58\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Anyway, the filename generator is modular.  \n14:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, okay... because i thought that was something that the programs would have to take care of  \n14:58\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Could use sha1's of everything but it wouldn't be readable.  \n14:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anyway, did not mean to talk you into new problems ;)  \n14:59\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true, although sha-1 would be nice for the comparison on conversion^^  \n14:59\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it's rather reliable, for all i know  \n14:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0As a CRC it's overkill but good.  \n15:00\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, eMule made a transition from md4 to almost exclusively sha-1 because md4 could allow different data to have the same hash under some wild circumstances  \n15:01\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0collisions  \n15:01\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0birthday paradox  \n15:01\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0How to become a CA without even asking...  \n15:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0?  \n15:02\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0certificate authority.  \n15:02\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/  \n15:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ahh  \n15:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The first rule of cryptography is follow all of the rules.  \n15:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The second is don't use md5.  \n15:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0and the third is when you are asked for a random number, don't supply the same random number every time.  \n15:05\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0LOL  \n15:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I suppose you heard about sony's blunder then.  \n15:06\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0no  \n15:06\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0:)  \n15:06\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0nope... really not much into crypto...  \n15:06\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0never had the time :(  \n15:07\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0They broke rules 1 and 3. And now the private key for signing ps3 games, isn't.  \n15:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0:-D pwned  \n15:08\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0There's a presentation about it at the 27c3 conference.  \n15:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the one that was held in berlin on christmas?  \n15:09\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0yup  \n15:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0finally some real expertise in germany! ;)  \n15:10\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The vid is hilarious. Mega trolling of sony.  \n15:10\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0btw, did you see the presentation on the stoned bootkit?  \n15:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i thought that stuff was really interesting  \n15:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Heard of it. mbr malware isn't new. It just isnt that easy to implement.  \n15:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yep. the guy was 18 back when he coded it. still in school  \n15:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i thought it was pretty impressive  \n15:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0his expertise and everything. but he wasn't good with people, you could see that quite clearly  \n15:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Also it doesn't survive a disk wipe which kind of defeats the purpose of fancy hiding.  \n15:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0maybe but being able to intercept data encryption like that  \n15:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0can be very useful in some businesses  \n15:13\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If you have kernel then the keys are yours anyway.  \n15:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mhmm  \n15:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0If I had secrets to keep, I'd probably use a ps3 which was disconnected from any network.  \n15:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Resists hardware attacks, supports linux.  \n15:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0may be true but it's not as fancy as having an encrypted container in an encrypted container using true crypt  \n15:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0both with extremely powerful passphrases, obviously  \n15:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^dump ram == ownd  \n15:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0DMA is not your friend.  \n15:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah but it's more fancy than just using a PS3 ;)  \n15:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0prolly not as secure  \n15:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but more fancy :-P  \n15:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ps3 + linux + truecrypt of course.  \n15:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, that would be fancy squared, i think ;)  \n15:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0or whatever crypt. important part is you type the passwd in to a keyboard on the ps3 itself, and don't give it network access.  \n15:19\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yep  \n15:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0No DMA, no cold boot attacks, can't pull the ram, it's powerpc so everything is weird.  \n15:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^aka 0x90 doesn't work  \n15:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but i think there is no password as good as a wii-mote and a drunk person setting the \"pass move\" with it ;)  \n15:21\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0A good KDF can improve the quality of the password.  \n15:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0kdf?  \n15:21\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0(key derivation function)  \n15:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm  \n15:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-crypto/src/main/java/org/xwiki/crypto/passwd/internal/ScryptMemoryHardKeyDerivationFunction.java  \n15:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That is a good kdf.  \n15:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0:)  \n15:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Takes ~5M of ram 100ms to turn a password into a key.  \n15:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i see  \n15:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Try to imagine brute forcing with those numbers.  \n15:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0BTW: $services.crypto.passwd.encryptText(final String plaintext, final String password)  \n15:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what's the final keyword doing?  \n15:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Still you have side channel attacks which are plenty on a web server but the crypto is pretty safe.  \n15:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0final only applies to the code inside of the function.  \n15:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It prevents that code from reassigning the variable.  \n15:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I didn't want that code to reassign those variables so I have the compiler check for me.  \n15:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Also you can look at final and know that it will not be reassigned.  \n15:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, like the const in C++...  \n15:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Almost.  \n15:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0const char\\* myString means the array is constant.  \n15:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0In java you can say:  \n15:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0final byte[] array = {0x00, 0x01, 0x02};  \n15:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0array[1] = 0x03;  \n15:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^that's valid.  \n15:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0array = anotherArray;  \n15:29\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0is not.  \n15:29\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0final byte[] myArray ---> char\\* const myArray;  \n15:29\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0the pointer is const.  \n15:30\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i see  \n15:30\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sometimes i think i should have majored in computer sciences  \n15:30\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0... ;)  \n15:31\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0lol?  \n15:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Pretty much no formal instruction in programming.  \n15:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, same here, but it seems you got a lot further than i did so far...  \n15:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0lots of try and error here... ;)  \n15:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The compiler is my teacher.  \n15:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0And I use whatever code style I like the best.  \n15:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0So you know my code because it self documents as much as possible by using this and final wherever I can fit them.  \n15:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0in C++ i used this-> in the beginning but soon dropped it because it was obscuring the code a little too much, imo. as for const... not using it too much either...  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0const is hard because so many functions don't support it.  \n15:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0if you have a function though and you don't change the input, the input must be const.  \n15:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0this-> sounds like it could affect performance.  \n15:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\u00a0-> means (\\*obj).  \n15:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true but i almost never bother defining that in the code. i don't seen a particular gain unless something screws up  \n15:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\\* means do a memory lookup.  \n15:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0memory lookup means let the proc idle for 200-500 cycles.  \n15:39\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i don't think this-> has any influence on the performance but i don't know definately  \n15:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^optimizing compiler.  \n15:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0C vs. C++  \n15:39\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0^^  \n15:48\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0ye :))  \n15:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ctrl+n  \n15:50\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0irssi or mIRC ?

 \n16:07\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0When it is, I \\_think\\_ I get a runtimeException which is swallowed because it's a onComplete and that can't happen.  \n16:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:07\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0When I move it out of the finally clause, into the catch, and copy paste it at the end, it works, no exception.  \n16:08\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0When I try to catch the exception, print it's stack trace and rethrow, no exception.  \n16:08\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0AKA everything works correctly.  \n16:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/uMQgVzsJ  \n16:34\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Wonder if I have bad hardware.  \n16:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0oh well. bed time.
