I guess it can safely be moved to 8.1M2  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: yes  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0test is @ignore  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: I don't think we can release with \u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12912  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13288 sorry  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: question for your on the invitation app  \n11:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: any plans for http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11095? Should we split it?  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0did you test installing it in a subwiki and verify it works for guest, for a user logged in locally and for a user logged in on the main wiki?  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's for cjd)  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: for example for Invitation.InvitationCommon I see it allows view for guests and XWiki.XWikiAllGroup in a XWiki.XWikiRights xobject. What about a user logged in on the main wiki?  \n11:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't recall, likely no because at the time when the automated tests were written there was no ability to automatically test subwikis  \n11:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we currently have 2 blockers:  \n11:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13179  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I see a XWiki.XWikiGlobalRights xobject on a page with an allow for groups: \"xwiki:XWiki.XWikiAllGroup,XWiki.XWikiAllGroup,\". Does that work? Doesn't it needs a XWiki.XWikiRights xobject instead for local XWiki.XWikiAllGroup?  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: so I can assume that right now the invitation app should only be installed on the main wiki to work properly?  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWikiRights is for the page, nothing do with the group  \n11:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: yes, that's a fair assumption because the testing has not been performed  \n11:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0AFAIK it's not part of the QA test program  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: ok then, I'll add a namespace restriction to it and remove it from the subwiki list of apps  \n11:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: would you be available to handle http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13288 ?  \n11:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ooo we have main-wiki-only restriction now ?  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n11:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I want to apply that to WebSocket because that is an endless difficulty  \n11:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: this afternoon yes  \n11:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0How do I set that ?  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n11:38\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I would like to write some JUnit tests in xwiki-platform-ratings module \u00a0but I'm not sure if their place should be in a xwiki-platform-ratings-test submodule (doesn't exist) or in xwiki-platform-ratings/src/test/java/org/xwiki/ratings/  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: example: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/182857c98f68924afcb99d1b3c39278dee698385/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-vfs/xwiki-platform-vfs-api/pom.xml#L44-L44  \n11:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok, that's easy enough :)  \n11:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0thanks  \n11:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0acotiuga: unit tests go with the code, so same module  \n11:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0only functional tests need a separate module  \n11:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(selenium)  \n11:40\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0thanks  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd:

http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XWiki+Commons+-+Extension+-+Repository+-+Maven#HCustomproperties  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0acotiuga: depend if you need a real XWiki instance or if you are fine with a mocked database which is just a map with documents in it and no search support  \n11:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0thanks also  \n11:40\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: last link has the most info  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/no search support/no query support/  \n11:41\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also if the goal is to test the UI you usually need a real instance of XWiki right now  \n11:45\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Maybe I didn't understand well the idea of unit tests and functional tests, but I thought unit test has nothing to do with the UI...  \n11:46\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Now, there are no tests on ratings module and I would like to start with unit tests and then to add some functional tests  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you said \"JUnits tests\", not unit tests, everything is run with Junit :)  \n11:47\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0ahh  \n11:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I'm indicating you all possibilities for Junit test ;)  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: can I push to platform on master?  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I see a commit message about rendering above I guess you're currently building platform and thus the answer is probably no  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can wait  \n13:39\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I can see that javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar is used as dependency in some contrib applications and even in xwiki-platform, but it hasn't a <version>  \n13:39\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Using it in the same way I got org.apache.maven.project.ProjectBuildingException: Some problems were encountered while processing the POMs: [ERROR] 'dependencies.dependency.version' for javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar is missing. @ line 71, column 17  \n13:40\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n13:40\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:41\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Should I look somewhere for that version or is there any way to skip this check \u00a0?  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0deleting playground again  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acotiuga: the version is inherited from the parent pom  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this check should not be skipped, it's very important :)  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should also not have a scope for it  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it should inherit from parent and be provided  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's also very important  \n13:43\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I have the test scope  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not correct  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not too bad but not the best  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's needed during testing it means it's required when executing  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(probably)  \n13:44\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-watchlist/xwiki-platform-watchlist-api/pom.xml#L77  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there should be a runtime scope, but since this jar is provided by the servlet container ti should be provided  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is what is done in parent poms  \n13:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it depends why you need it  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can't guess this so you need to see why it's needed  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or paste the reason why you have a problem when running  \n13:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reason = stack trace  \n13:48\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0since I'm trying to follow the example from the above url, I guess I need it for the same reason: running unit test and maybe to \u00a0mock something (XWikiContext, XWikiDocument)  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to know for sure  \n13:49\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/PPvcpDR9 stacktrace  \n13:55\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: cool, didn't realize that the top level menu on playground was only visible to admins or to users logged on the main wiki  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm actually it's a bug  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also visible to guests  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's not visible to local users only!  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: ok invitation app should not be visible anymore on playground for non admins  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm talking about the entry in the applications panel)  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acotiuga: so the main issue is that this dep in a provided and thus is not inheritable, see https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we cannot just set it in the modules that need it for compilation  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we also need it in the modules that uses the modules that need it for compilation  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess we could cheat tmortagne  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe by setting a compile scope and then removing that artifact when we create the WAR  \n14:02\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0vmassol: yes invitation is not visible anymore.  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the EM would see it as a compile time dep when installing extensions but since the artifact will always be present locally it might be ok\u2026 could be an issue if it has a different version though\u2026hmmm that would be a problem  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see any solution to improve the situation...  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: ok cool  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0moving to documenting my issues for 8.1M1 RN now  \n14:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: we could say the same from any <scope>provide</scope> dependency since this use case is the perfect illustration of what provided scope was designed for bu indeed this scope is not very nice for tests of backward dependencies  \n14:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*<scope>provided</scope>  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's true for all but servlet-api is really one we have to put back everywhere  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another option  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to add it as a dep for all modules by default  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure it's that nice though  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(by default = in top level pom)  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not very nice no  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it's not everywhere, far from it  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's usally in module that deal with request  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well in module that uses some other modules that deal with requests  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when you have some module in the way that depends on oldcore then you need it...  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really, you need to deal with request during the test  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not because you depend on oldcore that your test will use servlet API  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not really  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0java fails to load any class that has an import that uses the servlet api  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't need to use requests  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did not say use request in your test, I said during the test  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes thats what I said  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0many module depend on oldcore but use things that don't touch request  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't need to use requests during your test  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Java will not load all the classes of oldcore during the test  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just need to use a class/component that has some methods using servlet api but this class/component can also have some other methods not related at all to sevlet api  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0only what is actually used  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that you're using)  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it happened to me plenty of times  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0here is an idea  \n14:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* extract reusable test stuff from oldcore (mostly MockitoOldcoreRule and stuff around it)  \n14:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* make this new test module declare a runtime dependency on servlet API  \n14:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0most module that need oldcore during test need MockitoOldcoreRule (or should move to) and other oldcore oriented test stuff  \n14:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that way you automatically get servlet API when you use oldcore test tool but only as test dependency because you declare oldcore-test as test dependency  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the trick is in using \"runtime\" (which is inheritable) rather than \"provided\" for tests  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems interesting  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0only in a module that is alwyas used as test dependency  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue with that is test of oldcore module itself  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since they will need to be move in another module that can depend on oldcore-test which is not nice from test coverage point of view  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's nicer for all modules that use those test tools  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm what can work for everyone is to depend on oldcore test jar in oldcore-test and also add the servlet api dependency  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that way other modules use oldcore-test instead of oldcore and oldcore can still directly use MockitoOldcore and stiff like this  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/stiff/stuff/  \n14:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0doing it quickly in a branch, will be easier to understand :)  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: Found a regression in search on xwiki.org  \n14:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: what's the problem?  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I searched for something and opened the Location facet, then selected one location; it refreshed and then I cannot choose another location  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and the location facet was closed again btw but that's a minor usability issue)  \n14:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you have links in the location facet right?  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can try it here: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Search?text=clirr&f\\_type=DOCUMENT&f\\_locale=en&f\\_locale=&r=1&l\\_space\\_facet=10  \n14:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it shows a breadcrumb  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah wait  \n14:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n14:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's a breadcrumb  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm using it wrongly  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do I say:  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all spaces except those  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for some reason I thought there were all selected and I could uncheck them, which is what would seem logical but I don't see that anymore  \n14:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you need to use query syntax, this can't be done from the facet  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's strange because the other facets use another behaior  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0behavior  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they select all items and you can unselect  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not all, some  \n14:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's not the case for the datafacet  \n14:40\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually very few  \n14:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0each face can have its own behaviour  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only result type and language  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm still not easy way to see the syntax, we need to fix that  \n14:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0selecting all the values makes sense \\_only\\_ when the list of values is very limited  \n14:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0otherwise selecting all the values will generate a huge query  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you remind me how to exclude some locations?  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0-space:ReleasePlans doesn't work so that's not the right syntax  \n14:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0-space\\_exact:A.B  \n14:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you need to exclude subspaces also?  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not on xwiki.org  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we don't use them atm  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so yes space\\_exact is far from obvious without a help  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah one issue  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do you unselect a location? :)  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't tell me to hit the browser back button! :)  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(kidding)  \n14:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0as I said above, when you select a location you get a breadcrumb  \n14:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0which you can use to navigate to any parent  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't want to nav  \n14:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0including the root (home0  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm searching  \n14:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm referring to the Location facet  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh clickong on the home seems to work  \n14:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it shows you a breadcrumb  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's nice but really not intuitive  \n14:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's a breadcrumb  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be better to have checkbox as the othr facets  \n14:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we show it everywhre  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it means bavigating  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*navigating  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not navigating here  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I would never have dreamed being able to click on it  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and stay on the search pagre  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*page  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't even try because i didn't want to move away from the search  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyworks works for me FTM but I don't feel it's very intuitive  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/compare/feature-test-oldcore?expand=1  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by the way the forced dependency to test-component in xwiki-platform-core should be removed IMO, it force doing hack in the test module like this one  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if a module need test-component module it's not such a pain to put it in dependencies  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is what many modules do anyway already  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it's also wrong to make all module that don't need that depend on it, like XAR modules)  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: any idea why http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleasePlans/ReleasePlanHelp#HGenerateBackwardCompatibilityReport doesn't appear in

let me know when I can commit in platform on master  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok re \"the forced dependency to test-component in xwiki-platform-core should be removed IMO\"  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I see it's in your branch  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: not sure why you removed <artifactId>xwiki-commons-tool-test-component</artifactId> from xwiki-platform-test-page/pom.xml  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it provided by test-oldcore  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems good to have it to me, isn't it a direct dep  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*it's  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I know  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but still  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when oldcore goes away, it's still required  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what I mean by a direct dep  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok for the rest  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we need to see what effect this has on the rest ;)  \n15:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: you exclude ReleasePlans space and ReleasePlanHelp is in that space  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ah\u2026 stupid me....  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0brain not working fully today it seems\u2026  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry  \n15:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n15:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0np  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this shows that I still don't trust our search 100% yet  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to shake that belief!  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*shake off  \n15:10\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(inherited from the past I guess and from indexing issue we had)  \n15:10\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: \"now we need to see what effect this has on the rest\" for now the effect is less dependencies to declare for other modules  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't need to add the test dep removed from xwiki-platform-core in lots of places?  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not saying it's a bad thing!)  \n15:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: done building the release  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: according to Eclipse all is ok with the current state of the branch so it seems that all project that needed test-component where the same that were using oldcore stuff (or they explicitely declare test-component)  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe we were all stacking commits ;)  \n15:22\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n15:22\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0has quit  \n15:22\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: haven't you implemented this https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13290 already?  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm maybe it's different, not sure I understand fully, I'll comment  \n15:26\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes it's different, I get it now  \n15:26\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:27\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: yes, it`s about making the selected spaces of a template provider apply to their children as well  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so right now when you click in the tree  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it only selects the current node but not the children, right?  \n15:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, current space actually, so it inherits to terminal docs inside that space, including WebHome  \n15:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but not to Nested Spaces, children of the selected space  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok got it, thx  \n15:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0applied the same thing to the Annotations Administration section  \n15:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it`s highly problematic to inherit  \n15:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since you can not say that from this point on, don`t inherit anymore  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can unselect  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the tree  \n15:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and also, from this other point on, start inheriting again  \n15:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it`s also a problem of what do you store in the preference?  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok it's easy in the tree but harder to persist the information  \n15:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the top node and inherit programatically or do you store \\*all\\* child nodes (including the top node)  \n15:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ve looked at it from various angles and this was the only \"sane\" thing to do at the moment  \n15:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we will also probably encounter this problem in other forms in the future as well  \n15:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since I`ve encountered it twice so far (Annotations + Template providers)  \n15:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so maybe we`ll come up with a better approach in the end  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like XEclipse follow test dependencies like it was compile dependencies when the project is open  \n15:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit

ignores in commons for revapi  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for non-young apis  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that normal? do we need to to discuss that to make sure we don't break users?  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(users = extensions)  \n18:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those change are binary compatible  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why are they ignored then?  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have checked revapi issue tracker and didn't see an issue for them  \n18:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because they are incompatible from build point of view and revapi take that seriously it seems  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we need to report it if it's wrong!  \n18:30\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically if you upgrade you dependency on commons you will need to update you code if it call those methods to build properly  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just asked here: https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/36#issuecomment-205885076  \n18:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0its not wrong  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you said \"those change are binary compatible\"  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are they or are they not? :)  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n18:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but they are not compatible for the build  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so they are binary  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not source  \n18:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that it?  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so revapi is correct  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's reporting backward compat issues  \n18:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep but I think CLIRR used to not check source compatibility  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie binary + source  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n18:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by the way did we updated the release plan for revapi ?  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0clirr was checking source too  \n18:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok did not noticed  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re release plan no, we need to figure out how to do it, I'm still working on it  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I talked to Edy today about it during the release and on skype (see chat)  \n18:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess it's pretty much the same as CLIRR: remove the ignores and build  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not quite  \n18:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's just that we don't have tools to make it easier now  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's harder ATM  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I am discusing here: https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/29  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0clirr could output violations to a file  \n18:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway for 8.1M1 I can add those 3 myself CLIRR style for now, not a big deal  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ATM I have an issue  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I cannot make revapi fail  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/36  \n18:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm it was definitely failind when I added the ignore since I copy pasted the JSON :)  \n18:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/failind/failing/  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you try it?  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0remove ignore and build  \n18:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did we ungraded revapi in the meantime ?  \n18:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wondered abtout that but I rolled back locally to previous version of revapi and it didn't fail either  \n18:38\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: does not fail for me either when I remove the ignores  \n18:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe revapi have some kind of cache  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I used clean  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lukas has reproduced and I guess he's debugging now  \n18:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n18:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0poor lukas, ending up being used by XWiki  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes xwiki is not a relaxing user\u2026 ;)  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: \"Known flavors are not tested anymore in the Distribution Wizard\"  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean s/not/now?  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in RN of 8.1M1)  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forget that  \n18:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nop its the right word :)  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean flavors are now listed?  \n18:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you need to remember what was introduce in 8.0 actually for it to be more clear  \n18:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in 8.0 we started validating flavors in the background, known flavors and directly added without any validation  \n18:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0will rewrite it a bit  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n18:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0finishing with API stuff  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's a known flavor?  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you could also explain what it means to \"repair\" an extension in the RN?  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not clear to me)  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reminder to self: fix the line \"The XAR plugin now also verifies that Translations.xml pages are using the plain/1.0 syntax.  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"  \n18:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0done  \n18:51\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thx  \n18:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I tough \"repair\" was clear in the context of an invalid extension, it tries to find a way to repair it whatever is the issue  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how can an extension be broken?  \n18:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0usually because of an upgrade of the WAR where something changed  \n18:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me broken means it doesn't work, like there's a bug in it  \n18:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so repair would fix that, seems hard to do  \n18:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0core extension removed or new core extension conflicting with an installed extension for example  \n18:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's invalid from Extension Manager point of view  \n18:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0EM have no idea if you extension works or not  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"The Extension Manager now tries to repair automatically any invalid dependency and provides a \"Repair\" button to repair specific invalid extension.\"  \n18:56\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it does it automatically why is there a repair button?  \n18:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0dependency  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you install a perfectly valid extension which depends on an already installed but invalid one it used to fail  \n18:57\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so right now if you an extension that is invalid and has invalid deps  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0those deps will be fixed  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not the extension  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you need to click repair for that  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/you an/you have an  \n18:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I don't understad the snetence then :)  \n18:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Extension Manager does not fix anything at startup  \n18:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0its automatic as automatically done during install or another extension  \n18:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/or/of/  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok don't worry, I don't understand but it doesn't matter ATM. I fear not many people will understand either though  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this concept of repair and what it means)  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they'll just click on repair when they see it :)  \n19:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the plan :)  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hopefully that's good enough and they don't need to understand anything more  \n19:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they have a read message and a button talking about repairing it, I guess it's enough for most user  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok re revapi we know the problem  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/36#issuecomment-205890553  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lkrejci: :)  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(thanks for checking this out so quickly btw! that's great :))  \n19:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0vmassol: so the ball hopefully is back on your side ;)  \n19:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bb in 1 hour  \n19:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually 2  \n20:01\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:33\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<Daemoen>\u00a0lo folks  \n22:39\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n22:40\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:45\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:58\u00a0<Daemoen>\u00a0how do you extend the ability of macro to support additional modules (in the case of python; \u00a0i want to dynamically generate pages based on inventory information, thus i need to import mysql, etc)\n"}
