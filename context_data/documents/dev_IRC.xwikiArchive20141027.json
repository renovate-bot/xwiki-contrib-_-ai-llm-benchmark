Or at least in the jetty distribution?  \n10:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I am having a look at the latest snapshot, and it seems that the <body> element has a lot of stuff in it that should be present in <head> instead, like: meta, script, link, etc  \n10:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I know you worked recently on that area  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the WAR is about jars not UI  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just do a mvn dependency:tree on the enterprise WAR and you'll see what gets included  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the WAR module doesn't have deps on XARs....  \n10:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and I think the default jetty distribution will not bundled the webjar then  \n10:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: are you aware of the problem / planning to fix it?  \n10:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I will create a JIRA  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the XARs should have runtime deps on the JARs and indeed the WAR will also need to have deps on any webjar module required (directly or through other deps that require them)  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's true that if it's only a XAR that requires a webjar, then it won't be in the distribution if not added to the WAR's pom.xml  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: scratch that last thing. I was testing the view.vm template and it seems that when I add some output at the beginning on that file, 80% of the elements that are supposed to end up in <head> end up in <body> instead  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if I remove the output from view.vm, <head> contains the right elements  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0perhaps something buggy with our placeholder code that injects <head> elements  \n10:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11330  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it shouldn't IMO ;)  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I don't see how it could\u2026)  \n10:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok good Enygma` :)  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you have an idea for automation? (I don't see it in the issue description)  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well there's one I can think of actually  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll comment in the jira issue  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n11:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Trying my first clean xwiki install in a few years now.  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:11\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n11:11\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:11\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0hi  \n11:13\u00a0<Panther\\_1>\u00a0anyone here knowing how prevent an exception if \"/bin/view/Main/DatabaseSearch?xpage=plain&outputSyntax=plain&text=%00\" is executed?

CATALINA\\_OPTS and the default JAVA\\_OPTS to the following, restarted tomcat7 and refreshed the page: \"-server -Xms1600m -Xmx1600m -XX:MaxPermSize=384m -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 -Djava.awt.headless=true -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100\"  \n15:44\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Now I got the \"welcome to your wiki\" and logged in as administrator.  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01600m is a lot  \n15:44\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0800m didn't seem to do the job  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0default wiki pages?  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0800m as the best memory required is really a lot\u2026 too much  \n15:47\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0yeah, just installed the default pages that come with the package  \n15:51\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0hm. I am \\*still\\* getting the out of memory issue. Perhaps I am doing it wrong  \n15:55\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0if I do ps aux | grep java I get a single process for catalina, but it uses -Xmx128m  \n15:55\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0so I am definitely not doing it right.  \n15:56\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0Inge-: look into tomcat/bin/setenv.sh if it exists (and perhaps share the init script on pastebin or similar service)  \n16:12\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0if that would be /usr/share/tomcat7/bin, then there is a catalina.sh but no setenv.sh  \n16:12\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0in fact, no setenv.sh on the whole image  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Inge-: you could also check catalina.sh  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember documenting how to set the memory for tomcat on xwiki.org  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess you've read http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationTomcat#HOutOfMemoryError ?  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Inge-: there's no setenve.sh you need to create one ;)  \n16:17\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0\\*cough\\*  \n16:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0it's possible the init script doesn't export variables correctly... all tomcat-specific settings (both CATALINA\\_OPTS and JAVA\\_OPTS) should be in setenv.sh  \n16:24\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0right. bac in 4.x days, I just edited this in /etc/init.d/tomcat7  \n16:24\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0back\\*  \n16:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:30\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0ok, I got it to read the CATALINA\\_OPTS as exported from setenv.sh. It seems it is also getting the setting from somewhere else too, so it starts java with both -Xmx128m AND -Xmx800m  \n16:31\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I guess we are far outside xwiki itself at this point :)  \n16:42\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Found it.  \n16:43\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0If I create setenv.sh and export CATALINA\\_OPTS, then it gets one -Xmx setting from there as well as one setting from JAVA\\_OPTS that it exports somewhere else. If I instead export JAVA\\_OPTS, I get my own settings.  \n16:45\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n16:46\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:48\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0That also did wonders for the performance.  \n16:48\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Thanks for the help.  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n16:52\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't like this solution too much gdelhumeau  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to comment  \n16:57\u00a0<Gabriela>\u00a0has quit  \n17:43\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:11\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0is now known as <momomomomo>  \n18:30\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:41\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I have finished coding XWIKI-11337 where should I commit it?  \n18:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0on master in about 30 minutes once I finish the release  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can wait  \n19:04\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:21\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: that was not 30 minutes, but go ahead and push if you like  \n20:23\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n21:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: ok going to push thanks  \n21:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0master is now 6.3RC1 right?  \n21:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: Yes  \n21:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:11\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n22:11\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:16\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:29\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:00\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:04\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit\n"}
