joined #xwiki  \n09:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0good morning  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0After the move to contrib I'm hesitating in refactoring the package for the jira macro since there are several public interface I have there (used as extension points).  \n09:34\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're probably not used by anyone but still hesitating\u2026  \n09:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I guess you could put old API in aspects  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in that case I'll need to handle both in the internal  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0both = old api + new api  \n09:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure what you mean  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(new api = new api in new package)  \n09:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you call the new API in the aspects  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that doesn't work  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have components  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thus roles  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have about 4  \n09:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the macro impl uses those interface to lookup component impls  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0these components are still needed  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the classical package rename issue  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not many choices  \n09:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right you still need to lookup the old component so aspects won't help  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I could just drop backward compat  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think anyone is using it at all and if they do, it's not such a big deal to change the package name  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well the issue usually not changing the package but having an extension which work with both old and new version  \n09:40\u00a0<tdi>\u00a0has quit  \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's just is it ok to break retro compatibility in this case or not, I guess it is  \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(with a big warning in the documentation of course)  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the interface is inside the extension jar  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if you update the extension you get the new api with the new package  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0org.xwiki.contrib.rendering.macro.jira  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0org.xwiki.contrib.jira  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR for markdown I've used org.xwiki.contrib.rendering.markdown but it's all internal so it can be changed easily  \n09:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"so if you update the extension you get the new api with the new package\" again it's not that simple, if you want you extension to work with XWiki LTS and 8.2 you can't because there is no common API  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0retro compatibility is not about making easier to upgrade your dependency at build time  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the extension can be installed in LTS or in 8.2  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it'll work in both  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have an alias on it (ie feature) so if you have an old version of it, it'll be upgraded  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it conflict with the one existing in LTS branch  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not bundled :)  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by default  \n09:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can't have both at the same time so you can't have extension using the new API and extension using the old API at the same time  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's why I have a feature set  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<xwiki.extension.features>org.xwiki.rendering:xwiki-rendering-macro-jira</xwiki.extension.features>  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the user will never have both installed  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0am I missing something?  \n09:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you as a user might not control the extension of jira macro you are using so you can't \"update the extension\" to use new API  \n09:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\" so the user will never have both installed\" that's my point  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you don't update the jira macro then you get the old version with the old packages  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you update it then you get the new version with the new packages  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where's the problem?  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can answer that every time you break an API, \"if you want old API to work, don't upgrade\" :)  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or upgrade your code  \n09:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again you are only looking at it trough extension dev point pov view  \n09:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but breaking an API means breaking not up to date extensions for the user  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure that's the main decision  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and why I was hesitating  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but as I said I doubt anyone is using this api nayway  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*anyway  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if there's 1 person in the world doing it, they can update the package they use  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm just saying that's all retro compatibility is about, so either you break it or you don't  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure....  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that was the initial point, not sure why we're discussing this ;) anyway  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re package name you have an opinion?  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's hard to change thereafter I prefer more opinions  \n09:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't we have a rule for contrib jar extension packages ?  \n09:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't remember  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll also introduce a new JIRAConfiguration interface  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all we say  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that it must start with org.xwiki.contrib  \n09:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or so we do have a rule :)  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually we don't even have this written but it's a expectation  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that we have in voted mails)  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since the module is called jira I guess org.xwiki.contrib.jira is good  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only issue  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that if another module is contributed about jira  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like for example when we move the current jira module from platform  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when we move into contrib  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll need a paclage for it  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc it could be in a different repo and still use the same package but maybe not very nice, I don' know  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can have sevral jar with the same packages as long as it's not the same classes  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you are not going to put everything in org.xwiki.contrib.jira here, you will have internal and probably macro subpackage too  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ideally the package should be an isoltaed namespace to avoid clashes  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why I was suggesting org.xwiki.conrib.jira.macro  \n09:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was talking about org.xwiki.contrib.jira as a prefix  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so org.xwiki.contrib.jira.macro would be good I guess  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if we move jira module we should probably put it in the same project than this macro  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to synchronize them with the jira API  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wouldn't do that  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're completely different  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and using coimpletely different apis  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0shouln't they use same API ?  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's different  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're not doing the same thing  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the macro I tried to use the same api and it didn't work  \n09:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so there is several different jira APIs ?  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we're using direct http access for the macro for ex  \n09:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then sure they should not be in synch indeed  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the jira u platform is using JRJC: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/JIRA+Module  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0direct http access is not an API :)  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was talking about jira side API  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which had limitations for the jira macro  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was missing one api  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't recall which one though...  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I remember having to recode everything  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using HTTP instead of JRJC  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but JRJC is more powerful in general, progress support, etc  \n10:02\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0bah, tmortagne beat me to responding, thats what i get for not refreshing before i repond.. was busy digging through logs to remember what i had done to do the same thing myself =D  \n10:03\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0oh, and my response got rejected anyway for some reason... now thats even more amusing =D  \n10:04\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0any idea why my response to threads would be rejected by server even though im a subscriber to said list? (xwiki-users list)  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0daemoen: there's only 2 reasons  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02 reasons it can happen that is  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) you're sending with a different email address than the one registered  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) you're answer mail is larger than 100K  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n10:05\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0shouldnt be either of those, strange  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on users list?  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not 2)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just checked moderation queue  \n10:06\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0yeah, it flat out rejected the email, lol  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the mail you got back should tell you the reason normally  \n10:06\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0'You are not allowed to post to this mailing list'  \n10:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wrong mail then  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what email have you used?  \n10:07\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0i wonder... let me check something  \n10:07\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0nope  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sent you the mail privately that you're registered under  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you need to use this one :)  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie the mail that arrives on the liset server must be with this address  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*list server  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or register the other mail to not worry about it :)  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or that  \n10:08\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0lol, ill have to; \u00a0you can't send email using an alias =D  \n10:09\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0and here i thought i was being slick by making it easy to sort my mails from various lists  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm tmortagne we need to setup revapi in the top level poms for contrib too  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we need a top level parent-rendering pom too  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not in commons-pom ?  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I know  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my bad  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just that I depend on 6.4  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u2026.  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commons-pom 6.4  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0clirr should have told me about the backward comapt issue though  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check the 6.4 pom  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I rmeember  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0clirr is only set up in commons-core  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or in platform-core  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's not by default  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same for revapi actually  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(AFAIR-  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why ?  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could put it at the top but then we need to exclude it from all places where we don't want it  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0enterprise, tools, dev-tools, etc  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but it's a few skip properties to add so it's fine IMO  \n10:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0re parent-rendering, I tough about it but it was going to contain pretty much the same thing that parent-commons but sure you can add it just to be safe  \n10:14\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0am i missing the register link on the site in order to add comments/contribute to the docs ?  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0daemoen: it should be there  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0top right in the drawer  \n10:14\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0login, home, wiki index, page index  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it's a bit hidden now  \n10:15\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0yeah, it wasn't on the login page as a register link either =D  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm indeed we lost register on subwikis  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0go to www.xwiki.org  \n10:15\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0ahh, interesting  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0evalica: looks like we don't have register on subwiki anymore on xwiki.org  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was a trick before  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to fix this in xwiki platform itself  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some config option  \n10:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0tmortagne: what was the trick?  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically daemoen we only want global users on xwiki.org  \n10:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0it's because of skin?  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wasn't it a link in the skin for subwikis ?

 \n10:32\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0yes  \n10:32\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0you wind up with the egg files with pip too  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't pop download stuff on pypi ?  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/pop/pip/  \n10:33\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0right; \u00a0think of the egg as the python version of the java manifest  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep that's what I understood and it's actually so similar to a JAR that just loading it as a JAR might just work  \n10:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all I did to put pgments on maven central was to put the content of the egg in a jar  \n10:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*pygments  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0speaking of which looks like there is a new verison of pygments  \n10:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a02 actually  \n10:41\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0there :p  \n10:41\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0i like how you can wrap the code inside of a second code tag in order to retain syntax highlighting without having to escape the macro brackets =D  \n10:42\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0thats a nifty trick i hadnt seen before  \n10:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0great, thank !  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0daemoen: yup, we had to be clever in the implementation of this ;)  \n11:07\u00a0<samo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<samo>\u00a0is now known as <Guest83609>  \n11:11\u00a0<Guest83609>\u00a0HI, I'm looking for the one I used to call morgane, just know it was just a problem in the hibernate, I did not \"UNCOMMENT\" correctly all the lines in hibernate, good day  \n11:11\u00a0<Guest83609>\u00a0has quit  \n11:12\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Pbas: Related to http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13443, the List of Users property works as a suggest of existing users in the wiki.  \n11:13\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0IMO in that case is not used on its purpose  \n11:13\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I'm not sure what you want to achieve  \n11:14\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I'm closing the issue as Won't fix  \n11:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:17\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0acotiuga: My purpose wasn't user creation  \n11:18\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0If I have a custom application with NON multi select user list  \n11:19\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0so it should keep only one user  \n11:19\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I want only one entry if I fill my form  \n11:19\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0in this case, I have 2 users but display one  \n11:19\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0so you want to be limited to 1 entry when you add them ?

 \n11:22\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0its a fun little example that shows how easy but powerful it can be to use a scripting language like python inside of xwiki; \u00a0its my favorite way of showing off to people that have never seen xwiki. \u00a0I paste that same page in and they go \"wow!\"  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yo just need PR  \n11:22\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0So we're talking here about a mistake of somebody who's trying to add 2 or more users while it shouldn't  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0...  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0working now  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@daemoen: you could publish this as a snippet on extensions.xwiki.org  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or as an example on the python script macro page  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(woud be even better probably)  \n11:24\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0I was debating it, might have to remove the snarky little jab though, lol  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n11:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes, when i dev an xwiki application with not multiselect field, I don't want my user can fill 2 values  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0usually we capture output for e.x.o  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that we don't execute it live  \n11:25\u00a0<sagarhani>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:26\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0acotiuga: if user typing existant user \"not multi select' feature working well  \n11:27\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0is unknown user \u00a0a member of wiki? Is it a created user, or is just a name ?  \n11:27\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0but if he fill my forms with none existant user, 2 values are filled  \n11:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0just some text  \n11:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0not a xwiki member  \n11:28\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0hi all, is there an easy and efficient way to implement a JSON RPC client in xwiki page ?  \n11:28\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0So were going back to the fact that only existing \u00a0users should be typed there and/or use suggested ones  \n11:29\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0so this is an invalid input , but i'll take a look to fix this  \n11:29\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0no because we haven't this feature in \"list of user\" property  \n11:29\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0we haven't \"limit to xwiki user\"  \n11:30\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I want \"list of user\" property respect \"not multi selected\" feature  \n11:31\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0\"I want\" I mean \"it will be cool if \" ;)  \n11:32\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0To resume, \"not multi selected\" feature working well ONLY for xwiki user  \n11:40\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, vmassol do you know if it's possible to use an http client to send POST data in xwiki ? like httpclient for groovy ?  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: sure, any client will work  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: you can do whatever you want with groovy  \n11:42\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I mean to have a page in xwiki that do a request to a PHP script in post mode  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: works too  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have done that  \n11:42\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0could you lead me to an example  \n11:42\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0?  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there must be some groovy example on e.x.o  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0search on the groovy tag  \n11:43\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0and velocity ?  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: do you mean executing php inside a page or just having a form that lead somewhere else ?  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's harder in velocity since you'd need an http api  \n11:43\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0having a xwiki form that lead somewhere  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do provide a simple one to get the content at a url  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but no post  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it's very easy  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all you need is {{html}} macro  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you you html form in there  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/HTML+Macro  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you put your html <form> and when the user click the submit button it will send the request to the external website  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's just plain standard html, the only thing related to XWiki is the {{html}} syntax you put around  \n11:50\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, but what if we want to check the form values in xwiki before sending them to the php script ?  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it's not about a form leading to somewhere else is about a from leading to XWiki :)  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so for the form you can use {{html}} macro, then for the XWiki page receiving the form data the easiest is probably to use Groovy  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to do whatever to need to do before using httpclient to call the other website  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it all depend how complex what you need to do is  \n11:53\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, ok but httpclient is embeded in standard in groovy ?  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0groovy can use all Java classes available but I think it also have some http helper  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't know groov enough to give you an example  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"groovy http\" on google should probably give you what you need  \n11:55\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, I think it's http://javadox.com/org.codehaus.groovy.modules.http-builder/http-builder/0.6/groovyx/net/http/HTTPBuilder.html  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like it  \n11:57\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, how I can check if this class is currently available in my xwiki instance ?
