(regular page renaming does not work in my case)  \n15:29\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0I think it works - maybe you need to change the title of the page?  \n15:30\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0blackbird\\_: \u00a0the livetable displays page titles - not names  \n15:32\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0blackbird\\_: I take back what I said - the livetable shown page names - sorry  \n15:32\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0so the rename should work.  \n15:32\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Lalit: have your read this http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication ?  \n15:37\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sburjan: I just finished testing this latest build http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb/4.1-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-4.1-20120417.103019-17.zip  \n15:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0on which db ?  \n15:38\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0this is the standalone, jetty+hsqldb  \n15:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0have you tested the migration also ?  \n15:38\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I have also tested MySQL/MyIsam and MySQL/InnoDB with \u00a0success  \n15:38\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0only the migration :)  \n15:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0if not, I can test tomorrow on all db's, can't do it now because I am very busy  \n15:39\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0we still have an issue with Oracle, but all others should work now  \n15:40\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0ping me if you got any unexpected issue, but will be mostly off tomorrow  \n15:41\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay  \n15:41\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I hope sdumitriu will be able to fix Oracle by tomorrow as well  \n15:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0did we fix postgres on 3.5.1 ?  \n15:43\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I don't kown, what was the issue ?  \n15:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0failing migration :)  \n15:45\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0mm, oh, yes I remember sdumitriu mixup the mapping, it shoud be fixed  \n15:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ook fixed, at least on jira  \n15:46\u00a0<Lalit>\u00a0Thanks Denis  \n15:46\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0he had taken the mapping from 4.x in 3.5, which is cleary no compatible  \n15:53\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: Would you mind if I fix the warning in 40001 migration ?  \n15:56\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: what warning?  \n15:56\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0the one in the jira issue from Sorin  \n15:57\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0about object class references?  \n15:57\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0yep  \n15:58\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0you should use relative one in getMigratedObject  \n15:58\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0if you wish, go ahead  \n15:59\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but It`s not ok IMO to throw a warning if the object class reference contains a wiki reference which is \\*the same\\* as the current wiki  \n15:59\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it polutes the console uselessly  \n16:00\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0agreed, but it is useless to use absolute reference there as well, the warning has be added to detect such misusage, and should be removed on release  \n16:00\u00a0<Lalit>\u00a0Hello , I am unable to checkout xwiki-platform from github on my windows machine.Its probably due to the long path names - any idea how to resolve this ? any workaround ?  \n16:01\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: actually, I`ve found it quite cumbersome to create local references  \n16:01\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0actually, I still am unsure of what is the right way  \n16:02\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0since new DocumentReference(null, space, page) throws an IllegalArgumentException  \n16:02\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0EntityReference xwikiCommentsClassReference =  \n16:02\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0new EntityReference(\"XWikiComments\", EntityType.DOCUMENT,  \n16:02\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0new EntityReference(\"XWiki\", EntityType.SPACE));  \n16:03\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0or use a resolver, but it is IMO too much there  \n16:03\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0So we need a new constructor for DocumentReference  \n16:03\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not really, a DocumentReference is always absolute  \n16:03\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0since using EntityReference looks like a workaround to me  \n16:04\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so a (local EntityReference) != (DocumentReferene without a parent) ?  \n16:05\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0now I understand why I could not figure out how to create a local DocumentReference :))  \n16:05\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0A document reference always has all parents upto the wiki  \n16:05\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0this is what a DocumentReference ensure compare to an EntityReference  \n16:06\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, you have to admit that it is a bit confusing... since you actually want to create a DocumentReference (at least in you mind)  \n16:06\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0do we have any of this documented? (no sarcasm, just curious :) )  \n16:07\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0In the javadoc at least, AFAIK  \n16:08\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0DocumentReference: \"Represents a reference to a document (wiki, space and page names).\"  \n16:08\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Honestly, after the abandon of the inter wiki classes, I was in favor of removing all usage of relative reference, and ensure class and document wiki stay in sync, but Thomas an Vincent has never agree  \n16:09\u00a0<blackbird\\_>\u00a0evalica: I understand, but \\_how\\_ do I change the name/title?  \n16:12\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: I would agree with you. I also find relative references to be troublesome. The only place where they are vital is when you serialize them into page XML (i.e. for XAR export), but that more to do with serializers than references.  \n16:15\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: FYI, I have added EntityReference#removeParent(EntityReference), but I admit that this is still cumbersome to use. ie myRelativeEntityReference = myDocumentReference.remove(myDocumentReference.getWikiReference());  \n16:15\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0s/remove/removeParent/  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: we ddn't have relative ref initially. We didn't want them!  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but they were needed and we were asked to add them  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to support the use case of having a template wiki for example  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(still otp)  \n16:21\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: WDYM by template wiki? What problems occurred there?  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you store a full ref in the DB  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you copy  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the wiki  \n16:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but you do not store refs in the DB  \n16:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0you store serialized refs  \n16:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it`s just a matter of using the right serializer  \n16:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the code of the template was bad, not the absolute references.  \n16:23\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0(or we need to supply a $services.model.serializeLocally(...) method)  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we also support creating multi wiki links  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to differentiate between an absolute ref and a relative ref  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we already have that serializer btw Enygma`)  \n16:25\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0what I said, is just that since we do not support interwiki classe anymore, these are now useless there  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly, I wanted to remove them and you disagreed! ;)  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because you said people might be using them  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I said it's not possible becuase it's not working!  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you said, still they could think it's working...  \n16:27\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0really, but I said that if you do not want to support it, there no more need for them anywhere in that code, and you disagree with Thomas, and you have exposed the relative reference, which was not exposed before  \n16:30\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: multi-wiki links... using references?  \n16:30\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0can you please give me an example?  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the feature is called \"copy by reference\" afaik  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should ask thomas about it, I'm not an expert on the wiki manager module  \n16:32\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0blackbird\\_: if you what to rename the application's name - this is not possible yet. If you want to rename an application entry just use from the top menu: Page -> Rename  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0blackbird\\_: yep you'll need to rename all pages one by one ATM  \n16:33\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Denis Gervalle\u000f master\u000f \\* rba19c14\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/ba19c140582cb71a46a2015706524426cc151d24 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-annotations/xwiki-platform-annotation-io/src/main/java/org/xwiki/annotation/io/internal/migration/hibernate/R40001XWIKI7540DataMigration.java :\u000f XWIKI-7727 Remove warning about absolute XClass reference during Annotation migration - http://git.io/lTKNjQ  \n16:33\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: ok, never heard of it, but will ask Thomas. Thanks.  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIR Enygma` it means that you can have some pages in the template for which their content is not copied but instead \u00a0a link to the template is done  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thus allowing to maintain some content in a central location in a farm  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(whereas a content copy means you loose any chance of updating the content in a central location)  \n16:36\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Denis Gervalle\u000f stable-4.0.x\u000f \\* rd88a488\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d88a488f5a7099e8fa41ec10679d2eb48eb63334 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-annotations/xwiki-platform-annotation-io/src/main/java/org/xwiki/annotation/io/internal/migration/hibernate/R40001XWIKI7540DataMigration.java :\u000f XWIKI-7727 Remove warning about absolute XClass reference during Annotation migration ...  \n16:37\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: I think that is a feature of the ApplicationManager application (which is pretty much deprecated), but will have to check.
