It shouldn't be that hard. This week we have one day off ok but we should have been able to release Tuesday  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to analyse what's blocking us from doing that and see if we can remove roadblocks, change process, etc  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we had one week more, I'm pretty sure the issue would have been exactly the same  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(even worse potentially)  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma: re setting the date in the RN, it's the following line in the plan \"Set the Release date + Release flag in the Release Notes for version 9.3-rc-1 by editing with the object editor.\"  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleasePlans/ReleasePlan93RC1 )  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is just a FYI  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it still says \"no\" in the LT :)  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for \" Released?\"  \n13:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: thanks for letting me know about the release  \n13:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: I`ve probably confused it with the release plan, since they both require a date.  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n13:51\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n13:51\u00a0<tillo|>\u00a0has quit  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: I really like http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Proposal/KoelSkin/V1\\_2.png  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0simplicity FTW!  \n13:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0FTW?

I can add more deps but I can't exclude.  \n17:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm asking in case you did this before  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: well the packager is supposed to bring the bare minimum  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie things that are needed for all tests  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if it brings too much there's a problem  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember any exclude  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember any exclude possibility ATM  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it also add all dependencies of the project, I guess that's what Marius wants to exclude ?  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it also add all dependencies of the test project, I guess that's what Marius wants to exclude ?  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the deps are in the project they're needed  \n17:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in my case it brings a dep from the parent pom. Maven doesn't support excluding such deps so I though maybe I can tell the packager to not include it  \n17:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: they could be needed for the test but not the instance  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're \"test\" scope in that case  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm talking about func tests  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe marius is using it elsewhere  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0outside of func tests I mean  \n17:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0my use case it more complex. xwiki-platform-core 6.2.5 enforces this dep https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/xwiki-platform-6.2.5/xwiki-platform-core/pom.xml#L41 (bad practice) \u00a0and I want to use a more recent version. The problem is that xwiki-commons-test-component has been moved to xwiki-commons-tool-test-component, so I can't just declare a dep on xwiki-commons-tool-test-component because I'll get both.  \n17:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I need to exclude xwiki-commons-test-component:6.2.5 and include instead xwiki-commons-tool-test-component:9.3-rc-1  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I see ResolutionScope.RUNTIME in package mojo so that should be ok indeed  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: try redefining \u00a0xwiki-commons-test-component with scope test  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from what I need if it's scope test it should not be selected by packager plugin  \n17:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it has already scope test in xwiki-platform-core pom 6.2.5  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed  \n17:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/xwiki-platform-6.2.5/xwiki-platform-core/pom.xml#L46  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's weird then  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<exclusions> should be supported too normally  \n17:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, so you're saying that scope=test shouldn't end up in the war  \n17:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the war build by the packager plugin  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not in the current code but maybe it's wrong in 6.2.5  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: exclusions is for excluding dependencies of dependencies  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can't use that for the parent  \n17:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm using a recent version of packager, not 6.2.5  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking dependency resolution  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm actually no test is selected by ResolutionScope.RUNTIME I think  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a bug if it is since tests stuff shouldn't end up in the WAR  \n17:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed, xwiki-commons-test-component is not in the war, but I have its dependencies, so it must be something else  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm according to the javadoc ResolutionScope.RUNTIME is only compile and runtime  \n17:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0let me dig a bit and I'll get back to you  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n17:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe they come from somewhere else  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0moving to http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14217  \n17:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think I was mislead by the dep tree. xwiki-commons-test-component appears with scope test but some of its deps like xwiki-commons-component-api appear with scope runtime. The dep tree shows the shortest path to a dep. There must be other module that need xwiki-commons-component-api but the path is longer. Unfortunately for me, because the path is shorter the version used is 6.2.5 instead of 9.3RC1  \n17:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but I think I can do something about it  \n18:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: your setup looks very complex  \n18:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should probably do the opposite and use a recent parent but declare old dependencies  \n18:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0might make build a lot simpler  \n18:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think I will get into similar problems because the parent has dep management so I will get more recent versions for transitive deps which may break APIs  \n18:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but I could try  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends on the dependencies  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0transitive dependencies of core extension don't really matter  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's about transistive dependencies of other stuff but you probably don't have that many  \n18:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(core or already installed extensions)  \n18:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<slayerjain>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw mflorea \u00a0when we start xwiki we have:  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"2017-04-20 18:42:00,336 [coreLoadExecutor-6-thread-1] WARN \u00a0o.a.s.c.SolrResourceLoader \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Solr loaded a deprecated plugin/analysis class [solr.SynonymFilterFactory].
