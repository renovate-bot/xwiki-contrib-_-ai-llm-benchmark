:D  \n14:36\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0any\\*  \n14:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0I should say we are using Markdown 1.1 syntax :D  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0URL generator is not optimized to remove the WebHome part as far as I can see so yes it seems expected to me  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0WebHome is just implicit in a bin/view/Space/ URL but it's the same as bin/view/Space/WebHome  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it would be nicer to do this optimization indeed but it's not done yet)  \n14:48\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: so what would be the right way to link?

 \n14:56\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0instead of \"common steps\" we get \"WebHome ?\"  \n14:56\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0I get this https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/wiki/lcsbbiocore/create/common%3E%3EBioCore-Scraper/Deployment+-+dev/WebHome?parent=BioCore-Scraper.Deployment+-+dev.scrap-core-dev.WebHome  \n14:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have no idea what is markdown link syntax but the reference you have in this link looks correct  \n14:56\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0when I expect https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/wiki/lcsbbiocore/view/BioCore-Scraper/Deployment+-+dev/  \n14:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you sure this is the right syntax for markdown ?  \n14:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this looks like xwiki/2.x syntax  \n14:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0WebHome itself is not the issue in the URL you get  \n14:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0you are correct  \n14:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/wiki/lcsbbiocore/view/BioCore-Scraper/Deployment+-+dev/WebHome works well for example  \n14:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0but even with [common](BioCore-Scraper.Deployment - dev.WebHome)  \n14:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it doesn't work  \n14:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it just prints the text out  \n14:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it doesn't parse anything  \n14:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0if i put [common](BioCore-Scraper.Deployment+-+dev.WebHome) then it will create https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/wiki/lcsbbiocore/create/BioCore-Scraper/Deployment%2B-%2Bdev/WebHome?parent=BioCore-Scraper.Deployment+-+dev.scrap-core-dev.WebHome  \n14:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0which again points to create a new page  \n15:00\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0is it the spaces?!  \n15:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seems to me pegdown does not like having white spaces in a reference  \n15:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe you need to escape it or something  \n15:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't have much experience with it  \n15:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is it better with \u00a0[common](BioCore-Scraper.Deployment\\ -\\ dev.WebHome) ?  \n15:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(trying to escape the white spaces)  \n15:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown/blob/master/src/test/resources/MarkdownTest103/Markdown%20Documentation%20-%20Syntax.md#link does not say anything about white spaces  \n15:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0nope  \n15:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: damn, maybe i try removing spaces in the space  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: would be great if you could report this issue on jira.xwiki.org so that we reference some issue on pegdown close it with the a workaround if someone find one, etc  \n15:19\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: without spaces in the Space it works  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so indeed that's pegdown that does not like getting a white space in the middle of a link  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure if it's a bug or if white spaces are officially forbidden from its point of view  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not very nice in XWiki use case where you can have anything in a reference  \n15:23\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok, sure, i submit an issue  \n15:23\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0XE-1517  \n15:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0spaces in spaces :)  \n15:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0cjd ok ok  \n15:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks for fixing  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: thanks or the issue, will report something on pegdown side  \n15:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0No, it's a good issue, I just got a kick out of the name  \n15:33\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: i saw the github issue, thanks! it's just the () and [] are inverted  \n15:33\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0just fixed it in jira...  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0thanks I modified the github issue  \n15:40\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0hi folks, what would be th easiest way to alter an existing page via commandline?  \n15:44\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: with + in the URL it doesn't work either  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: yes but this is XWiki's fault that does not expect it to be a URL  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we need to decode it basically  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which should not be too hard to fix  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I will look at it  \n15:44\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: cool, finally something useful I submitted :D  \n15:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: actually did you try with the wiki link syntax suggested by the guy ?  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from what I see in the code we interpret them so it seems to be that's actually the right way to use wiki link and the other syntax is just interpreted to do something but are really more suited for URLs  \n15:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: [label](lcsb-sysadmins.Sandbox+Space \"Title\") this doesn't work  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0its not the syntax he suggested  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BTW, you can use spaces for links but only in wiki links [[wiki link]] which will link to a file named wiki-link.html, but only if you have the WIKILINKS extension enabled. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[[lcsb-sysadmins.Sandbox Space]]  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure about the label  \n15:54\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i don't know what wikilinks extension is  \n15:54\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0but the double brackets also don't work  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you use [[lcsb-sysadmins.Sandbox Space]] it does not do anything ?  \n15:56\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: it will create a link to https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/wiki/lcsbbiocore/create/lcsb-sysadmins/Sandbox+Space?parent=lcsb-sysadmins.Sandbox  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so it does work  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that URL just means the target does not exist  \n15:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[[BioCore-Scraper.Deployment - dev.WebHome]] should be better if that page exist  \n15:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and for the label maybe the same way than with other links works too  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0forget that looks like there is no way to indicate a label actually  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so [[BioCore-Scraper.Deployment - dev.WebHome]] works but it does not cover your use case where you want to display \"common\"  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commented on the issue  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is a known issue  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see XRENDERING-362  \n16:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so indeed XRENDERING-362 contains everything, Trefex so the right syntax for your use case is [[label|lcsb-sysadmins.Sandbox Space]] but it's not yet supported by XWiki  \n16:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n16:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not a quickfix...  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it is supported  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's missing is support for params and labels  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah maybe that's what you meant by not supported  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes that's what I meant  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(since we already talking about [[lcsb-sysadmins.Sandbox Space]] working well)  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/talking/talked/  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, I read quickly your conversation (was catching back)  \n16:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: all I can think of right now if to use the page URL  \n16:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0either the complete URL or something like [label](path:/xwiki/wiki/lcsbbiocore/view/BioCore-Scraper/Deployment+-+dev/)  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or even [label](path:Deployment+-+dev/) from a page in the same space  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[label](path\\:Deployment+-+dev/)  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[label](path: Deployment+-+dev/)  \n16:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically path means \"put that directly in the href in html\"  \n16:43\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: is it safe for me to remove org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-statistics-ui from the <xwiki.extension.features> list for XE?
