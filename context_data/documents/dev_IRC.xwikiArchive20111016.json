How can I push content in an automated fashion to a wiki page?  \n22:24\u00a0<sable>\u00a0I'm happy to organize in several pages or one huge page or whatever is easiest. I think perhaps what I'm trying to do isn't commonly done with Wiki software out there as I'm having trouble finding anything relevant from other wiki software as well.  \n22:33\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0i think the easiest thing to do is have the page query the servers when you load the page  \n22:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0using scripting  \n22:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not sure how you collect the information but you do things like http requests from scripting.  \n22:41\u00a0<sable>\u00a0So I'd write a script within an XWiki page, which probes for information on a server? I'd have to write some code that would respond to the XWiki query as opposed to attempting to do an HTTP PUT or something?  \n22:42\u00a0<sable>\u00a0Ideally I collect the information in diagnostic bundles. I am free to present information from these bundles in any way I want.  \n22:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I see  \n22:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0so you want your diagnostic code to run periodicly and then publish?  \n22:48\u00a0<sable>\u00a0Yes, that's about how I was approaching this. But that's not to say that's the best way. Its a good way though because if I add the diagnostic dump tool to a host, it would automagically appear as another server in the XWiki  \n22:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You could have it do an http request which calls some wiki code and that code takes the parameters and adds an object to a wiki page for your server. Then on the display side the page with the objects has some code which displays statistics based on what \"server objects\" are linked to that page.  \n22:49\u00a0<sable>\u00a0It's certainly possible to do it the other way around, but I'd have to convince the XWiki to query the diagnostic framework somehow to pick up additional servers\u2026  \n22:50\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0if you did it in reverse then it would be on a \"pre page load\" basis  \n22:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*per page load  \n22:53\u00a0<sable>\u00a0OK so if I wrote a Groovy script, I'd have an HTTP PUT call that script (from the client), then this script would call a handle to dig through a given diagnostic dump.  \n22:54\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<sable>\u00a0Then collect given tuplets and return them as objects  \n22:54\u00a0<sable>\u00a0is that about a reasonable approach?  \n22:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes  \n22:55\u00a0<sable>\u00a0OK, I think I can manage the rest with the API docs\u2026 Thanks for the help!  \n22:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0and it would get the display page, manipulate the objects in that page, and then save it.  \n22:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0!search xwiki scripting  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \n22:56\u00a0<sable>\u00a0The API seems pretty rich and with Groovy I seem to have nearly everything I need  \n22:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that's a good starting point  \n22:56\u00a0<sable>\u00a0Yeah I'm already perusing it  \n22:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0this project can be done from either velocity or groovy so it's your choice.  \n22:57\u00a0<sable>\u00a0I suppose Velocity would be less exposing  \n22:59\u00a0<sable>\u00a0ListTool seems pretty powerful and might sufficient for a large part of this  \n22:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Velocity has security advantages (you can run it with less permission) but if it's an internal site then it's basicly your call.  \n22:59\u00a0<sable>\u00a0Its an internal site, but since its an automated process its usually better to make do with fewer permissions if possible  \n23:01\u00a0<sable>\u00a0Thanks for the info  \n23:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0sure thing  \n23:02\u00a0<sable>\u00a0has quit  \n23:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n23:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
