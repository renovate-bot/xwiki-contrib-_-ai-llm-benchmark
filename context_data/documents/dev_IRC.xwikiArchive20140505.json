So I think we still need to describe the improvements in 6.0 even if they were included in 5.4.4. The alternative is to move the doc from 6.0X to 5.4.4 RN  \n10:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the problem is that the RN won't make much sense for someone actually upgrading from 5.4.4 to 6.0  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0as for differences between 6.0 and 5.4.4, there may be some, but little, the most important is the fact that we upgraded Solr on 6.0  \n10:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0then we need to move the doc to 5.4.4RN  \n10:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I reviewed the list http://jira.xwiki.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20XWIKI%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20%28%226.0%22%2C%20%226.1-milestone-1%22%2C%20%226.0-milestone-1%22%2C%20%226.0-milestone-2%22%2C%20%226.0-rc-1%22%29%20AND%20component%20in%20%28%22Search%20-%20Generic%22%2C%20%22Search%20-%20Solr%22%29%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20AND%20text%20~%20%22solr%22  \n10:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and everything has been ported to 5.4.x except the Solr/Lucene upgrade  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: ok (the upgrade are in the 6.0 release note already)  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same thing for most EM/DW stuff too  \n10:31\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:16\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: what is the status of XWIKI-10268 ?  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(I tough you had created a branch for it but could not find it)  \n12:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tortagne: almost done, I postponed the commit because I wanted to write some unit tests.

Solr doesn't do any modifications. The issue is that someone else is modifying the document (the list of objects in this case) while Solr indexer reads it. I know for sure that the REST resources are modifying directly the cached document instead of cloning it. I'm not sure it's rest in this case, but I'm pretty sure it's not Solr's fault  \n22:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok didn't realize it was the same problem as before, but we'll need to analyze it and find out the problem  \n22:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the exception is thrown here https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-search/xwiki-platform-search-solr/xwiki-platform-search-solr-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/search/solr/internal/metadata/AbstractSolrMetadataExtractor.java#L348  \n22:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it simply iterates the list of properties of an object  \n22:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok seems xwiki.org's ES instance has some invalid data in it now\u2026. http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ActiveInstalls/TotalCounterValue I need to figure this out....  \n22:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:11\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n23:36\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
