We need to fix the tests so that they don't output it but it's not easy.   \nvmassol - (27/10/2008 11:35): these are tests have either not set the full environment context or that test for failure conditions  \nvmassol - (27/10/2008 11:35): but the tests are fine  \nvmassol - (27/10/2008 11:35): it's just that you shouldn't see the stacktraces  \nphreeza - (27/10/2008 11:35): okay :)  \nxwikibot - (27/10/2008 14:04): Design.OfficeConverter was modified by xwiki:XWiki.asiri - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/OfficeConverter  \nxwikibot - (27/10/2008 14:05): Design.OfficeConverter was modified by xwiki:XWiki.asiri - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/OfficeConverter  \n\n"}
