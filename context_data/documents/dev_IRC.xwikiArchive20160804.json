 \n17:29\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0Im pretty sure there was a bug report but I cant remember  \n17:29\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0where  \n17:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mmm I don't recall specifically if it's .54 but there is a version after which they broke their space handling so spaces in URLs are broken  \n17:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0XWiki can't really adapt to tomcat without #1 breaking space handling in all other containers and #2 breaking space handling in older versions of tomcat  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: what you are talking about is http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13556  \n17:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0right, so boubou I'm not thinking of what you are...  \n17:40\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what boubou is talking about is something wrong with 7.0.53 I think but don't remember exactly what it was  \n17:41\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0tmortagne 7.0.54 ;)  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0boubou: you sure there was a jira ? mabe it was just a discussion on IRC or mailing list  \n17:44\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0cant remember :(  \n17:44\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0maybe it was a bug report with Tomcat  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I do remember there was something about 7.0.5\\*  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I do remember is that it was a regression introduce in a version and fixed in the next  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0boubou: forget that the thing I had in mind was a regression in 8.0.32 and fixed on 8.0.33, no idea what you are talking about after all  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(was XWIKI-13317)  \n17:50\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0ok  \n18:02\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0does the file should still exist ? /var/lib/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0boubou: this file is not used anymore no  \n18:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:51\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0hi guys, I'm choosing a wiki platform for an collaborative plataform and I would like to ask if it is possible to create template pages, with pre-determined sections which will be described by users. So, users may fill section contents but cannot change sections headers or ordering. Is it possible?  \n19:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0barretto: it sounds like you're looking for Structured Data, it has these benefits as well as others, for example you can query by the value of a field  \n20:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you might want to take a look at XWiki App Within Minutes, it's for creating \"classes\" of structured data  \n20:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If you just want a guideline template, we have those too, but they do not enforce that you must not change certain parts  \n20:48\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:54\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0sound interesting  \n20:55\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0i have to create some pages, all with same structure (static structure) but its content will be provided by our users  \n20:56\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0like a wiki, with a fixed structure  \n20:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Yes, this is most of what we do with XWiki for our intranet  \n20:56\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0all features of a wiki are supposed to be working just as it would in a  \n20:57\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0in a \"open structure\" page  \n20:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0With App Within Minutes, you get to make a \"sheet\" (displayer) of the user's data so you can decide how it will look, you also can control the edit sheet  \n20:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0by default this is just a sequence of their data, if you want to go complex then you can edit the wiki code of the sheet  \n20:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0now if you're thinking more simple, then you just want a template page, something to get somebody started but not to restrain them in any way  \n20:59\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0they cannot change the page structure  \n20:59\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0another important aspect to me is that those pre-structured pages could be created by API, since these strucutres are in a DB. I would develop a java backend that would read this data and create the pages  \n20:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok so you have like hundreds or thousands of these structures ?  \n21:00\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0basically there are ~10k pages with the same structure, but with different titles and content  \n21:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n21:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh sorry, I thought you were asking to create the \\*structures\\* through the API  \n21:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0creating pages with structured data programmatically is quite simple  \n21:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you can also use the REST API  \n21:02\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0sound cool  \n21:02\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0its xml based, right?  \n21:02\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0is there a JSON api?  \n21:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0REST is XML or JSON as you wish  \n21:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it talks both  \n22:00\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0cjd it sounds really interesting... I'm going to give it a try locally and run some tests  \n22:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok, if you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask  \n22:01\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0is there any documentation about creating pages programatically? and how to set this structures permanent?  \n22:01\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0(or I will find it straightfoward at API documentation?)  \n22:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think the API reference is going to be the most straight forward  \n22:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0getDocument() \u00a0addObject() \u00a0getObject() \u00a0\u00a0set('property\\_name', $value  \n22:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0etc  \n22:23\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0got an out of bounds exception while installing... do you mind \u00a0to take a look?  \n22:23\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0seems DB connection was stablished  \n22:23\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0tables were created  \n22:24\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/U5W54TfZ  \n22:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0for testing why not just use the .zip version ?  \n22:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0./start\\_xwiki.sh and it's up  \n22:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0self-contained  \n22:43\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0it is important to understand full installation process because I'll have to describe it to the infrastucture manager  \n22:43\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0we'll test it in a test-server environment  \n22:44\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0probably later, I will have to move further and try to install and run it from github repo  \n22:56\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0i'm using .war \u00a0tomcat7/ubuntu  \n23:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0make sure you're using the correct version of the mysql connector for your version of mysql  \n23:05\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0you nailed it, my bad  \n23:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it was a wild guess :)  \n23:11\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0well, i have to leave now...
