But best is to remove the cotnainer  \n10:30\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n10:30\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0ok, rebuilding  \n10:31\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0again :-/  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you say \"again\", it means it's not working for you?  \n10:34\u00a0<acotiuga1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0If so I suggest you clean everything and retry  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and download the compose file this time  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually not sure why you need the compose file  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why don't you use \"using docker run\"?  \n10:35\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case both methods should work fine since I've just tested them  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(after cleaning up my docker install)  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with docker system prune + remove the images)  \n10:48\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0always the same message  \n10:48\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0to prune:  \n10:48\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0docker rm xwiki && docker rm xwiki-mysql  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the error is simple, it means you haven't specified a host name for the mysql container  \n10:48\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0right?  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you use docker for something else?  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not, do a \"docker system prune\"  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you've mentiopned is not enough  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it won't remove the volumes  \n10:49\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0ok, again ...  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that this is not related to xwik  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's docker stuff  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're not lucky you've chosen the worse options ;)  \n10:50\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0i know ... never worked with docker before ;-)  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) you've not used docker run which is the recommended approach  \n10:50\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0btw: can i use the docker version for production?  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) you've use the sample extract that needs to be adapted  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of the provide fumm docker compose file  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*full  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re production I don't know YMMV  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some people use docker in prod  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0others don't  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've never had the opportunity to try it in prod so I can't help  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but theoretically yes it can be used  \n10:51\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0ok ;-)  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but don't use docker-compose  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since you'll not map the voulmes easily with that  \n10:52\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0so there are no security issues or sth else  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you don't control their locations)  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what you mean  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to run xwiki on an OS  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whether this os is inside docker or not will have the same flaws related to this os AFAIK  \n10:53\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0i don't care about location since its a separate vm only for xwiki ;-)  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you do  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you run in prod you need to hande backups  \n10:53\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0shure  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean you save the whole VM?  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the backups)  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well you still do want to manage the volumes  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since there are maintenance operations that requires you to go there  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex, when the solr schema changes you need to remove the solr directory before restarting xwiki  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just to give one example)  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you may also need to run mysql commands \u00a0from time to time  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to set up some indexes, etc  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway this is standard docker stuff  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that you'll need to read about  \n10:56\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0ummmm ... ok ^^  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for production my recommendation would be to use apt (http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationViaAPT)  \n10:59\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0is working :-) :-) :-)  \n10:59\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0THANK YOU!!!!!!! :-)  \n11:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n11:10\u00a0<zgi>\u00a0so, how to autostart that?  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't know, docker has some restart flag I think  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/host\\_integration/  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(never used that, I've just gooled it)  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*googled  \n11:16\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0recreating playground  \n12:14\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the good news is that recreating playground doesn't crash the wiki anymore ;)  \n12:26\u00a0<acotiuga1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: could you re-check playground.xwiki.org?
