I'm trying to run some functional tests locally and our test fwk isn't connecting to my FF (FF starts and opens up but nothing happens after that). I'm using the same version of FF as on the agents.

The test uses getText() to see if some text is present on the page. The text that we're looking (the app name) for starts with a space and getText() removes the leading and trailing whitespace..

I'll google to find how I did it from riot (ther's a special chat for that)  \n13:59\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0by chat I mean room  \n14:00\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0ahh  \n14:00\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0un-q'd  \n14:00\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0thx  \n14:00\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0maybe it's @appservice-irc:matrix.org  \n14:00\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0https://solson.me/2016/10/08/irccloud-to-matrix.html  \n14:01\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0don't remember how I join that though  \n14:03\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0maybe @appservice-irc:matrix.xwiki.com  \n14:04\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0hmm no  \n14:05\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0I tend to have an irc window available for the stuff that is not reachable from Matrix and I can just join the channel to do manual stuff if needed  \n14:05\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0maybe you didn't set this up on matrix.xwiki.com and it was setup on matrix.org  \n14:06\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0I remember very well using it  \n14:33\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0hey so im working on application-tour  \n14:33\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0so it seems https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/TOUR-52 already works, however it also refers to https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/TOUR-38 which would allow to switch to edit mode or a different viewer  \n14:33\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0since we use xwiki apis to get urls, i was thinking about adding two fields to the class that has the tour to be used when generating the bootstrap-tour json: mode (/edit/) and queryParams (?viewer=attachment)  \n14:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0pbondoerffer[m]: how do you know to open the tour on the opened/target page?  \n14:33\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0this is retrocompatible because if the field is not set we can assume they are empty and take the default values (currently view-mode and no query params)  \n14:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm referring to the link target  \n14:35\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0so you can specify target pages in the tour for each step  \n14:36\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0when you load any page, it launches a xhr to a page that does an xquery which gets the tours that are relevant to the current page  \n14:37\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0and if there is a tour for that page (handled in TourCode/TourJson), then bootstrap tour is loaded using requirejs and initialized  \n14:37\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0and once tour.init() is called, bootstrap tour sees that it has a tour going on and does it's thing, resumes the tour  \n14:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that was not my question. You are on a tour step, that shows some part of the page where there are links. i.e. the tour shows your the breadcrumb. What happens if the your clicks on one of the breadcrumb links?  \n14:38\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0oh! sorry, misunderstood  \n14:39\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0it will likely stop the tour currently. bootstrap tour does have an option to allow a tour to continue once an event is registered on a dom element  \n14:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, so you're saying that the \"move to a different page\" must be made by the tour, when you click the Next button, not by clicking on some link/button on the page  \n14:40\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0but this seems to be different from what is referenced in TOUR-52?  \n14:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0depends, the tour step could say \"Click edit to move to the next step\". So the user would click the actual edit button/link on the page, not the Next step button provided by the tour  \n14:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0this would make the tour more interactive. Otherwise, using only the Next button is more like a presentation. But maybe this is not possible or too difficult to implement at this point. But you should keep it in mind  \n14:44\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0yeah  \n14:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0now, even if you move to the next page using the Next button, how do you know on the next page that you are \"in the middle of the tour\"  \n14:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0e.g. the tour takes you from page A to B. Maybe we don't want to show the \"half\" of the tour on B when you access B directly. We want to show the tour only if your come from A.  \n14:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0also something to keep in mind  \n14:46\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0mflorea: bootstrap tour handles that on it's own using localStorage  \n14:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, so the tour doesn't start on B if you access it directly?  \n14:47\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0yes it would be nice to enter in \"tour mode\"  \n14:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0directly= if you click on B in the navigation tree or in the breadcrumb  \n14:47\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0and when in this mode, the tour perform checks on what you click and only allows to follow the \"tutorial\"  \n14:47\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0(if you click elsewhere it doesn't nothing or tell you that you're in tour mode and that you cannot click there)  \n14:47\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0s/doesnrt nothing/does nothing  \n14:48\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0oh yeah it wont  \n14:49\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0it will only work if you follow with the tour because it increments counters in localStorage before sending you to the relevant page  \n14:49\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0but we can hook into events and have bootstrap tour be more interactive (ex: click on this to go to the next step)  \n14:50\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0and hide the next button entirely by then  \n14:50\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n14:50\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0http://bootstraptour.com/api/#reflex  \n14:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0pbondoerffer[m]: back to your question, how will mode and queryParams be used exactly? Note that I'm not entirely familiar with the Tour code.  \n14:58\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0well right now we can move to different pages but only in viewmode (we use the xwiki api to get the urls which default to view)  \n14:58\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0the idea is to use the mode to pass it to the xwiki api to get the edit/view url (any other modes?)  \n14:58\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0and to use the queryParams to append it to the generated URL as we have no way of doing that right now?  \n15:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I see. The \"mode\" you are referring to is called \"action\" in the XWiki world. For instance $xcontext.action returns \"view\" or \"edit\" or whatever is the current action. As for \"queryParams\", it is called \"queryString\" in the Java Servlet API (e.g. $request.getQueryString()). That is if you want to be in line with the XWiki naming. Otherwise what you proposed sounds good.  \n15:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it won't hurt to send a mail on devs mailing list saying \"I'm going to add ... if anyone thinks this is wrong please reply\".  \n15:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0gdelhumeau (who wrote the tour app initially) maybe be able to reply  \n15:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Hello  \n15:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I actually think you don't really have the choice if you want to see edit page  \n15:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so, indeed, the action must be given too  \n15:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and probably the query string too  \n15:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0what I don't llke is that it make the UI of the Tour edutor more complex  \n15:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0maybe we should hide some details by default (with http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse)  \n15:16\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:42\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:43\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0hello, I'm looking for a way to clone a theme to create a custom one from it, is there a way to do that?

I understand that some evol will change that but I have to stay on the LTS release on this wiki  \n16:59\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0btw https://www.evernote.com/l/AHeKt\\_HjIdFNmZkluCiLbSZFAIYdxgCrKgI the avatar icon is different from the rest  \n17:00\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ok to summarize I understand now that navbar doesn't always represent the top header  \n17:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0Slashman: not sure what documentation to give you. you can check out where is defined https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-flamingo/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin-resources/src/main/resources/flamingo/colorThemeInit.vm and https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-flamingo/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin-resources  \n17:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0but I guess this is complicated  \n17:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the simplest thing for you would be to: create a custom SSX and overwrite where you have problems  \n17:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I guess I can also simply modify the file skins/flamingo/colorThemeInit.vm in the webapp  \n17:04\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0evalica: so maybe the issue is that we use navbar when we shouldn't?  \n17:04\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0\"Navbars are responsive meta components that serve as navigation headers for your application or site. They begin collapsed (and are toggleable) in mobile views and become horizontal as the available viewport width increases.\"  \n17:05\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0it doesn't seem that this is what we're using them for  \n17:07\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0all the examples at http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar seems to be about menus  \n17:07\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0your example with the height should be investigated - let me check what are we using, and if it's from us or Bootstrap  \n17:07\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:08\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0actually we do have menus too on the right (for the header)  \n17:10\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ok so I guess one solution is to adopt the bootstrap terminology for xwiki and our \"header\" is a \"header navigation bar\" where \"navigation\" doesn't mean that it's used to navigate in the doc hierarchy of xwiki but to perform some navigation in the site  \n17:10\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0now how to convey this to users...  \n17:10\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0Slashman: what were you confused about initially?  \n17:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0VincentMassol[m]: so indeed, this comes from us https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-flamingo/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin/xwiki-platform-flamingo-skin-resources/src/main/resources/flamingo/less/drawer.less I think it was used in order to preserve consistency  \n17:12\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0evalica: I don't see the height  \n17:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I guess the most confusing part is the word \"navigation\". We cannot remove it, since that's how they call it, but we could add maybe some hints with examples  \n17:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0VincentMassol[m]: the difference in height is given as padding, not as height. same visual effect.  \n17:13\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ok  \n17:13\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0VincentMassol[m]: I didn't know what navbar was, now I have a better understanding of what is what, but I add to tinker on it, like setting a color to bright fushia and look everywhere to understand where it was  \n17:14\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0but I guess there is no perfect solution  \n17:14\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0yep and you probabmy though it was only the header  \n17:14\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0\\*thought  \n17:15\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0yes, I also can't find anyway to change some colors, like the Breadcrumb text  \n17:15\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0evalica: I think that some explanation text for each section might help  \n17:15\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0but don't know if users will read it  \n17:15\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0Slashman: would it have helped for example if you had between \"Navigation Panel\" (title) and \"@navbar-default-color\" something like:  \n17:16\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I think top bar would be best, but ofc it should only modify the top bar then :p  \n17:17\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0\" Used for example for headers, footers and in-page menus.\"  \n17:17\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0yes but it's not only top bar  \n17:17\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0it's also footer, drawer, admin menu, etc  \n17:17\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0in short in this editor you don't set specific elements of the UI but types of elements  \n17:18\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0so would a hint below each section have helped or not really?  \n17:18\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0I think all the other ones are pretty self explanatory  \n17:18\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0it's really only \"Navigation Bar\" that can be an issue  \n17:20\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0result so far: https://cloud.aceslash.net/index.php/s/ov1fuZELaEvK3Kf  \n17:20\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0evalica: even if it's called Nav Bar maybe just using \"Bars\" in the menu would help ?
