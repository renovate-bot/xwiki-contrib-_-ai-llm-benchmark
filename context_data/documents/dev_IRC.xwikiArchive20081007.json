I just have some final questions before \"committing\". When I do a mvn install in the build script, how maven knows that the artifact should be put in the \"snapshot\" repository? (it deduces it from the version -SNAPSHOT or should I specify it somewhere on the command line?)  \nvmassol\\_ - (07/10/2008 16:22): fmancinelli: yes if it's a snapshot (i.e. SNAPSHOT in the name) then it's put in the snapshot repo  \nvmassol\\_ - (07/10/2008 16:22): (it's automatic)  \nfmancinelli - (07/10/2008 16:43): ok, it's done. let's see if the build works now (...waiting for the queue :))  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 17:02): fmancinelli: you should put XEclipse in a categoy by itself (we have one tab per projet)  \nfmancinelli - (07/10/2008 17:03): ok  \nxwikibot - (07/10/2008 17:22): XWiki.YJ was modified by XWiki.YJ (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/YJ  \nfmancinelli - (07/10/2008 17:26): the build works, but it installs in /home/maven/.m2/repository and this repo is not visible on the web (public\\_html/snapshots tree).   \njvdrean - (07/10/2008 17:40): fmancinelli: is the deploy maven goal applicable to your build ?  \nfmancinelli - (07/10/2008 17:41): jvdrean: I think so.   \nfmancinelli - (07/10/2008 17:42): jvdrean: basically I had to do a deploy instead of an install. ok I am changing the script and retrying   \njvdrean - (07/10/2008 17:42): fmancinelli: install put the artifacts in the local repo, deploy deploys them (sic) on the remote repo  \nfmancinelli - (07/10/2008 17:44): jvdrean: yes, my fault. I thought that since everything was built locally on the maven machine an install would have been equivalent.  \nfmancinelli - (07/10/2008 17:44): jvdrean: ok trying with deploy  \njvdrean - (07/10/2008 17:45): fmancinelli: I know what you mean, I think that's what I thought first too :)  \nxwikibot - (07/10/2008 18:34): Features.I18N was modified by xwiki:XWiki.amelentev (add note about impossibility of objects,tags translations) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/I18N  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 19:02): amelentev: Maybe you could specify that the current solution is to have one object per language and add a language property in the objects? Actually this is the user guide so this should be moved to the dev guide somewhere I think  \namelentev - (07/10/2008 19:11): In http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/InternationalizingApplications ?  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 19:17): amelentev: yes sounds good. A new section might be adequate  \namelentev - (07/10/2008 19:19): ok. adding \"1.1 I18n of XWiki objects\"  \nxwikibot - (07/10/2008 19:26): DevGuide.InternationalizingApplications was modified by xwiki:XWiki.amelentev (add small \"I18n of XWiki objects\" section) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/InternationalizingApplications  \nxwikibot - (07/10/2008 21:27): XWiki.BernhardKraml was modified by XWiki.BernhardKraml - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/BernhardKraml  \nxwikibot - (07/10/2008 22:37): XWiki.pydieng was modified by XWiki.pydieng (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/pydieng  \nxwikibot - (07/10/2008 22:41): XWiki.pydieng was modified by XWiki.pydieng (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/pydieng  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 22:44): hi  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 22:47): Is there a known issue with table and WYSIWYG ? I'm unable to define background color from the WYSIWYG editor and save the page. Each tme the page is saved style information is lost  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 22:56): cykl: yes tables cannot have background colors  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 22:57): actually some table feature have no wiki syntax equivalent and thus are ignored. Ideally the wysiwyg editor should be modified so that you don't see these \"extra\" features  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 22:57): this is what we're doing in the new wysiwyg editor we're working on  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 22:58): I agree. So the right way is to embed some html code ?   \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:01): cykl: if you really want a table background then you'll need to use the wiki editor and use HTML <table>  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:01): (but then you won't be able to use the wysiwyg editor to edit it thereafter)  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 23:05): Yes I need to comply to the main website style. Perhaps I can do it by customizing the css, but since i need a different background-color for each row if think i will encounter the same issue.  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 23:08): Currently, i'm trying to see if we can replace our confluence wiki by xwiki. Xwiki looks better and is easier to extend but I still have a few no-go to solve.  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:21): cykl: yes CSS is the best way if you need the same style for all tables  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:22): cykl: I'm interested to know the no-go (so that we can improve XWiki even further)  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:22): cykl: would be great if you could send a mail on the xwiki users list with your issues. We might have solutions or at least we'll know what we should work on in the near future  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 23:26): Sure, I will do it in few weeks. We have some long term requests and a few showstoppers  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 23:27): Being involved in the FOSS (and in OW2 :-) ) I know how user feedback is important  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:39): cykl: ah cool, what project are you working on at OW2? :)  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 23:40): we are the ugly duckling: ProActive :-)  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:41): Ok. I must be missing some background information to understand the joke ;)  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 23:41): I think that I met you at SC08, you was on the booth isn't ?  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:42): nope that wasn't me  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:42): maybe Stephane Lauriere, Ludovic Dubost or someone else from xwiki project  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:42): actually I don't think any of us was there  \ncykl - (07/10/2008 23:43): ok. I have a really bad memory when names are involved.  \nvmassol - (07/10/2008 23:45): yeah me too, I understand  \n\n"}
