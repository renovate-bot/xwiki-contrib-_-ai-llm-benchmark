It's less important though since the pb is only on chrome. I thought it was a regression but maybe not  \nvmassol - (15:30): any more feedback on the 2.6 release?  \nvmassol - (15:31): should I continue the release or wait a bit more?  \nvmassol - (15:44): myxwiki.org keeps restarting all the time....  \nvmassol - (15:44): any idea?  \nvmassol - (15:44): http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Admin/ShowLog doesn't work anymore for some reason  \njvelociter left at 15:46 (Remote host closed the connection  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 15:47  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 15:56  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 16:24  \njbrBridge - (16:32): [dirk] where can I find a document about the xwiki 2.1 syntax ?  \njbrBridge - (17:27): [dirk] Hi - i have \u00a0a document which I cant access, delete ...  \njbrBridge - (17:27): [dirk] Document name: \"++++TemplateSkriptDokumentation+\"  \njbrBridge - (17:27): [dirk] I think the '+' makes the troubles, but I don't know how the get in the page name. :-/  \njbrBridge - (17:27): [dirk] Can I delete or rename the page. The tomcat process starts to consume a huge amount of cpu.  \njbrBridge - (17:27): [dirk]  \njbrBridge - (17:27): [dirk] Is there a way to delete this page from the database?  \njvelociter - (17:31): vmassol: you receive the restart emails right ?  \njvelociter - (17:33): looks like there are lot of errors coming from the cinqtulipes wiki  \njvelociter\\_ joined #xwiki at 17:42  \njvelociter left at 17:42 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \njvelociter\\_ is now known as jvelociter ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nvmassol - (18:12): jvelociter: yes  \nvmassol - (18:12): (I receive them)  \nvmassol - (18:12): dirk: we haven't documented it yet  \nvmassol - (18:12): (the xwiki syntax 2.1)  \nvmassol - (18:12): what we have right now is in the release notes  \nlpereira left at 18:24 (Quit: Leaving.  \njbrBridge - (18:27): [dirk] I have in XWiki 2.5.1 something weird.  \njbrBridge - (18:29): [dirk] 1.

Verify the spelling or contact your administrator.  \njbrBridge - (19:34): [dirk] ?  \nvmassol - (19:37): dirk: it's defined there: http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/TagCloud  \nvmassol - (19:37): (as obejcts)  \nvmassol - (19:37): you could check the visiblity and whether you have the correct rights  \nvmassol - (19:38): dirk: just tested and it works for me. It's probably a rights issue you have or you have imported the XAR in a running wiki  \nvmassol - (19:38): (we had issues with this pre 2.6)  \nvmassol - (19:38): to ensure the macro is registered you can edit the page and save it  \nvmassol - (19:38): it'll re-register it  \njbrBridge - (19:45): [dirk] Just upgraded to 2.5.1 - and the problem is only in one installation.  \njbrBridge - (19:45): [dirk] Saving TagCloud resolve the problem.  \njbrBridge - (19:45): [dirk] I also found: Unknown macro: spaces  \njbrBridge - (19:45): [dirk] Is there an easy way to check which macros are \"lost\" ?  \nvmassol - (19:48): dirk: you can find registered macros on this page: http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/WikiMacros  \nvmassol - (19:49): s/macros/wiki macros/  \nvmassol - (19:49): it would be easy to report macro definitions for macros that are not registered  \nrrodriguez left at 19:50 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nvmassol - (19:50): fyi on my local install I have 3 wiki macros registered: tagcloud, spaces and activity  \njbrBridge - (19:51): [dirk] activity ? This I can't see here.  \nvmassol - (19:51): it's in http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Activity  \nvmassol - (19:51): you should have it normally since otherwise you home dashboard isn't going to work  \nvmassol - (19:51): unless you've kept the old dashboard  \nvmassol - (19:51): (the old Recent Changes one)  \njvelociter - (20:04): I think there is a performance issue with the new dashboard  \njvelociter - (20:05): locally, it takes between 4 and 6 seconds to display a page with the new activity dashboard (like home page or admin profile)  \njvelociter - (20:05): while all other pages are under 1 second  \njvelociter - (20:05): (I have imported 1000+ documents so I have created many activities entries)  \njvelociter - (20:05): we should look into it. It's blocker IMO since the home page should display blazing fast  \njvelociter - (20:07): (especially since 1000 activities is not that much)  \nsdumitriu - (20:09): Yes, there is a performance issue with the activity macro  \nsdumitriu - (20:10): Maybe some more indexes are needed  \njbrBridge - (20:10): [dirk] Main.Activity - is this a 2.6 page - i can't found it in the 2.5.1 xar.  \nsdumitriu - (20:10): Yes, 2.6  \njvelociter - (20:10): guys what do you think we make colibri the defaultbaseskin now ?  \nsdumitriu - (20:11): jvelociter: Not possible yet  \nsdumitriu - (20:11): Since there are still some dependencies on albatross  \njvelociter - (20:11): ah ok  \nsdumitriu - (20:11): I've been wanting to wead them out for a long time, but never got the time  \nsdumitriu - (20:12): s/wead/weed  \nsburjan` - (20:17): :)  \njvelociter - (20:19): sdumitriu: you know them all ?  \njvelociter - (20:19): maybe I can help if we have a list  \nsburjan` - (20:20): I guess this will make the package a little bit smaller too  \nsdumitriu - (20:20): No, one idea I had just now was to use a modified core to list all the times when an URL referencing albatross is used.  \nsdumitriu - (20:21): And then run all the tests  \njvelociter - (20:26): yes that would be a good strategy. there is nothing obvious in any case.. I'm running colibri as default base skin, and so far everything looks good  \njbrBridge - (20:33): [dirk] Is there a way to have multilingual confirmation emails for the user registration ?  \nsdumitriu - (20:36): dirk: Yes  \njbrBridge - (20:37): [dirk] o.k :-)  \njbrBridge - (20:37): [dirk] Do you have a link for me O:-)  \njbrBridge - (22:06): [dirk] Please have a look - this is really annoying : XE-757  \njvelociter\\_ joined #xwiki at 22:21  \njvelociter left at 22:25 (Ping timeout: 250 seconds  \njvelociter\\_ is now known as jvelociter ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nfmancinelli left at 22:47 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nEnygma` left at 22:53 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \njvelociter left at 22:54 (Remote host closed the connection  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 22:54  \njvelociter\\_ joined #xwiki at 23:09  \njvelociter left at 23:12 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \njvelociter\\_ is now known as jvelociter ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nvmassol - (23:26): http://www.eclipse.org/mat/ is really cool  \nvmassol - (23:26): just ran it on a local 2.6 XE  \nvmassol - (23:26): sdumitriu: yahoo javascript compressor is using 22% of all memory  \nvmassol - (23:26): (17MB of heap)  \nvmassol - (23:28): and python PyDictionnary is the second one, takes 8MB (11.3%)  \ncjdelisle` - (23:30): Wow 22% is bad.  \nvmassol - (23:31): velocity runtime instance comes third with 6MB (7.79%)  \ncjdelisle` - (23:31): I'd be +1 for dropping minification entirely.
