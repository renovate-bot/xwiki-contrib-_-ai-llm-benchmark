Is it fine to link some GPLv3 code into XWiki? On the other hand we are also linking a lot of ASF code, so I guess this is ok though not really clear.  \n14:16\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0My understanding is apache and lgpl are \"compatible\" while gpl is not.  \n14:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: AFAIK no it's not ok, if you use any GPL code the whole thing become GPL but as I have the samee understanding as cjd about lgpl and asf  \n14:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/as I/I/  \n14:20\u00a0<+fmancinelli>\u00a0I read that Apache says that ASL and LGPL are compatible, but that's not the opinion of the FSF. For the GPL, in general, I had the same guess... Is it still the case with GPLv3?  \n14:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0don't know GPLv3 a lot but my understanding is that the v3 tend to be even more restrictive in general  \n14:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe the guys behind what you are trying to use already had the question and have more informations  \n14:24\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0GPLv3 is seems to be a probabition on patented software but instead it contains a patent pool, similar to how GPLv2 contains a copyright pool.  \n14:24\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n14:24\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Software patents on GPLv3 software are free to use in all GPLv3 software (according to my interpretation of the text).  \n14:24\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0off topic :)  \n14:25\u00a0<+fmancinelli>\u00a0anyway, I've found a compatibility matrix... So if you want to use a GPLv3 library in a LGPL2.1 project you can do it... provided that you relicense the whole thing as GPLv3 :) So the answer to my question is no :) http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility  \n14:28\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:30\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fmancinelli: yep, I had the same issue with PircBotX: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-7571  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(see comment there)  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we don't distribute the ircbot app as part of XE I think it's ok to keep XE LGPL  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however what I understood is that if you start using the ircbot app in your runtime wiki, you make it GPL if you wish to redistribute it  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hope I got it right\u2026 ;)  \n14:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: git log --follow  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: doesn't work  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the first thing I tried  \n14:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0fmancinelli: No, GPL3 isn't compatible  \n14:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's OK if it's for an optional extension  \n14:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Like we have the PHP extension  \n14:39\u00a0<+fmancinelli>\u00a0hmmm... I don't understand. In the compatibility matrix what I read is this: \"If you want to use a GPLv3 library in a project released under LGPLv2.1+ then it's OK if you convery project under LGPLv3\"  \n14:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We don't want to convert to LGPL3 yet  \n14:41\u00a0<+fmancinelli>\u00a0ops, sorry I meant : \"If you want to use a GPLv3 library in a project released under LGPLv2.1+ then it's OK if you convery project under \\*\\*GPLv3\\*\\*\"  \n14:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0(Actually I do, but that's for the whole community to agree on, since we don  \n14:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0't have a copyright assignment form  \n14:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0fmancinelli: Exactly  \n14:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0This would mean that XWiki becomes GPL  \n14:51\u00a0<+fmancinelli>\u00a0sdumitriu, I am lost :) Let's take Vincent's PircBotX... In order to use it, XWiki should be GPL'ed. But since it isn't PircBotX is not usable as a library with the current version of XWiki. To me this means that even if it is an extension (i.e., not committed in xwiki-platform), the precondition for using it is to have a GPL'ed runtime  \n14:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Nope  \n14:51\u00a0<+fmancinelli>\u00a0so to me this means that right now, the PircBotX extension is not usable in the current setting. (and the same would be for any GPLv2/3 library)  \n14:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm platform build seems to be in a very bad shape, 499 failures in the last build  \n14:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and it's like that since 3 days actually  \n14:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0fmancinelli: The key is in the difference between the official product and each instance  \n14:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We ship XWiki Enterprise  \n14:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Which doesn't have the IRC extension included  \n14:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The moment someone installs XWiki and adds extensions, they make a \"derivative work\"  \n14:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That instance isn't \"XWiki Enterprise\" anylonger  \n14:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's \"XWiki Enterprise as available on http://xwiki.org\"  \n15:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The official \"XWiki Enterprise\" can't be affected back by the changes in an instance  \n15:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Like we can't change the license of \"Apache HTTPD\" if we install a custom GPL plugin on one of our servers  \n15:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0What this means is that only our \"derivative work\" is bound by the GPL license  \n15:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So yes, xwiki.org is now effectively GPL  \n15:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The difference between GPL and LGPL is in how linked code imposes the license  \n15:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So, for us it means that any other application that uses \"xe as seen on xwiki.org\" as a kind of library must also be GPL  \n15:03\u00a0<+fmancinelli>\u00a0sdumitriu, I see. But XWiki.org exists only in binary form. Where is the source code with the GPL headers in source files? :)  \n15:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But I don't think that anybody uses xwiki.org as a library  \n15:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0fmancinelli: That's a problem that we'll have to think of when someone actually tries to make us conform to the GPL...  \n15:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But I don't think the GPL header is actually required  \n15:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The license just asks that the code is available  \n15:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And as long as we don't have many custom jars, we can just offer the standard packages  \n15:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Now, there might be another loophole that would make even this \"xwiki.org is GPL\" requirement invalid  \n15:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since we can argue that the relation between extensions and the XE platform isn't one of libraries <-> application, but one more like programs <-> operating system  \n15:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't know if that would stand up in a courtroom, since I'm not a lawyer, but it's worth a try  \n15:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's valid because XE doesn't use the extensions, but the extensions use the services offered by the platform  \n15:11\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:11\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I agree that extensions are different because they are not being distributed with the binary.  \n15:11\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0re debian non-free repo  \n15:12\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0and the end user has no such requirement to not link things because he is not copying/distributing.  \n15:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Right, actually this is the main difference between v2 and v3, being available on a network counts as distribution  \n15:14\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0you mean v3 doesn't allow for non-free repos?  \n15:14\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0cjd: It all depends on where you set the limit between \"library\" and \"standalone application\"  \n15:20\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:20\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0Hi. Is there an idea list for GSoC?  \n15:22\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0I was thinking in adding support for bootstraps or lesscss.  \n15:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0faryshta: there is http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/#HProposedProjects2829 but you can propose other idea, best place to talk about that is mailing list I think  \n15:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:29\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0tmortagne, I think bootstrap is a major opensource tool.

What do you think?  \n15:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0faryshta: I don't know bootstrap very well but if that's a major open source tool then yes ;)  \n15:37\u00a0<+fmancinelli>\u00a0sdumitriu, Thanks for your explanations.  \n15:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0evalica: Nice  \n15:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0:) sdumitriu you were my inspiration and all the sources I needed :P reusing everything  \n15:45\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0tmortagne, twitter.github.com/bootstrap/  \n15:47\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0tmortagne, bootstraps is a CSS framework. It was created by twitter and used worldwide as a way to avoid wasting time on front end development.  \n15:47\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0faryshta: what would be the idea ? just allowing script to use this framework in XWiki ?  \n15:53\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0tmortagne, Yes. Maybe its too simple.  \n15:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sounds a bit too simple but i'm not much of a frontend guy so maybe I don't get the main point  \n15:55\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0tmortagne, well the idea is that using this framework you won't need to work on front end anymore.  \n15:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0faryshta: the best is probably to detail a proposal in the mailing list  \n16:00\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0tmortagne, k thanks.  \n16:01\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:02\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: updated friday's pull request  \n16:26\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:48\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n16:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:55\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I've just reviewed your pull request....  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it looks closed  \n17:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I see your comments  \n17:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0could you commit it so I \u00a0can resync ? and after I will add the regex part  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why is the pul request closed?  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I cannot commit anything  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's closed  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also you don't need to resync anything  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the regex part is about 20 seconds  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you find it hard I can add it at the same time as I merge  \n17:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I re-opened the pull request  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why was it closed?  \n17:12\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it would be better if you can add the regex thing if it takes only 20 seconds, for me it would take a little bit longer  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the question is not how long it would take you  \n17:12\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it was closed because I wanted to create a pull request with \\_only\\_ my modifications  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but whether you want to learn something or not :)  \n17:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and I created 2 pull requests, and it seems I closed them by mistake  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02?  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok\u2026 I'll try to sort this out...  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to find some time first  \n17:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0from now on I will create a separate branch on my fork so I won't create mess on official  \n17:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and I will pull request from that branch and \\_not\\_ from master  \n17:14\u00a0<CIA-120>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* rc89b9fe\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/c89b9feae8908c54918fd0f325ea3122e4fed959 \u000f/ (4 files in 3 dirs):\u000f Fix escaping tests. - http://git.io/gy2TqQ  \n17:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0guys, platform builds fails for the past 5 days..  \n17:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there are lots of unit tests failing  \n17:30\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:30\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0tha13  \n17:30\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:30\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:31\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: checking platform build  \n17:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it started with build 1652: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all the failing tests are casued by the same reason  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the 499 failing  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0java.lang.NullPointerException  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol> at com.xpn.xwiki.internal.DefaultXWikiStubContextProvider.initialize(DefaultXWikiStubContextProvider.java:96)  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol> at com.xpn.xwiki.test.AbstractBridgedXWikiComponentTestCase.setUp(AbstractBridgedXWikiComponentTestCase.java:70)  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking now  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so the platform build has been caused by me  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing  \n18:08\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(yesterday)  \n18:13\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0does xwiki support jquery?  \n18:15\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0faryshta: We use prototypejs which is an alternative to jquery.  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from https://www.google.fr/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=does+xwiki+support+jquery I'd say yes, but you may want to explain your questio\u00e0n  \n18:16\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0cjd, thanks.  \n18:16\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0hehe ask 2 developers, get 2 answers :D  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you didn't answer to the question  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki will support whatever js tool you want  \n18:17\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Indeed I didn't.
