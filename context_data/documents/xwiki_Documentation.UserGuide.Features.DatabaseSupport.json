This allows XWiki to be fast and scalable. It also allows you to use the [Programming](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Programming) features to perform queries in your pages on any data contained in other pages.\n\nTheoretically XWiki supports the [same databases Hibernate supports](https://community.jboss.org/wiki/SupportedDatabases2). This means that if you provide the correct Hibernate mapping file all those databases should work fine with XWiki.\n\nMore specifically the [XWiki Development Team officially supports a subset of all those databases](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DatabaseSupportStrategy).\n\n\n"}
