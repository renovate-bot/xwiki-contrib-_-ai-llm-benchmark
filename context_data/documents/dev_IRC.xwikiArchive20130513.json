That makes sense let's say  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yes it's normal  \n11:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, but is it correct to have ui-all installed ?  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not listed twice  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this step layout is one section per wiki  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can see your wiki name above each extension listed  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: that's the extension you have installed  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this step is not dealing with defult UIs  \n11:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's dealing with extensions  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's suggesting you a new version of your extension  \n11:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0the \"UI-all\" part was confusing. I was expecting to see only \"UI\"  \n11:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thanks  \n11:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but you have UI-all installed  \n11:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this step is not trying to be cleaver right now it's just upgrading what you have  \n11:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I see  \n12:01\u00a0<alexch>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, DW migration was ok to 5.0.1.

I'd like to prompt my users for user input for one field, connect to a database external to xwiki, and then display formatted results. I see there is a plugin to execute sql from xwiki, so does this sound possible? If so, how can I avoid storing the password to the database in the source?  \n14:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:46\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:47\u00a0<jbwiv1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:50\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n14:50\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0has quit  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n14:57\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n15:25\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<jbwiv1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<SvenDowideit\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n15:36\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:42\u00a0<tekzilla\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n15:49\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n17:02\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n22:25\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n22:47\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has quit  \n23:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:50\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n23:51\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit\n"}
