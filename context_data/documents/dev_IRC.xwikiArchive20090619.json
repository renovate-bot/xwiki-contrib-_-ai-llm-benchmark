But if i log in with LDAP account i can get only programming rights in the main wiki and not in the virtual wiki. any ideas?  \ntmortagne - (19/06/2009 11:51): maggo: by default when a user log in LDAP the user is created/update on the wiki so i think the issue in your case is that when you log in LDAP on the wiki \"subwiki\" the xwiki user is created/updated in the wiki \"subwiki\" and so is not the main wiki user you gave programming rights  \ntmortagne - (19/06/2009 11:52): let me search if there is a general way to force LDAP auth to create only on main wiki but i think there is not, yet  \nmaggo - (19/06/2009 11:53): ok how to do this? disable LDAP in subwiki and activate try local?  \ntmortagne - (19/06/2009 11:54): yes you will have to disable LDAP wiki by wiki now  \ntmortagne - (19/06/2009 11:54): in XWikiPreference page (edit with object editor)  \ntmortagne - (19/06/2009 11:55): XWiki.XWikiPreference  \njvelociter left at 11:55 ()  \ntmortagne - (19/06/2009 12:08): maggo: you don't even need to enable try local (trylocal is just to try \"normal\" xwiki auth when LDAP fail), the LDAP auth will try main wiki with main wiki conf when it fail on local one  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 12:09  \nmaggo - (19/06/2009 12:28): tmortagne: ok so i have to configure the LDAP connection in xwiki.cfg and not in xwiki it self  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 12:30  \ntmortagne - (19/06/2009 12:30): maggo: configure LDAP in xwiki.cfg and just disable it in subwikis  \ntmortagne - (19/06/2009 12:31): xwiki.cfg act like a default LDAP configuration for which you can overwrite each property in XWikiPreferences  \nmaggo - (19/06/2009 12:36): ok i'll give it a try, untill later again ;-)  \ncristinaS joined #xwiki at 12:43  \ntachirei joined #xwiki at 13:07  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 13:10  \ncristinaS left at 13:21 (\"Get out of that boring IRC client!
