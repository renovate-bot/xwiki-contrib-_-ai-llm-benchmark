I'm running the same.  \nStulle - (08:49): are running it on a linux or win environment?  \ncjdelisle - (08:50): Linux but \"that shouldn't matter\" ;)  \nStulle - (08:50): that's what i thought when the OpenOffice Import was partially broken because IE did send the entire path rather than just the name and it did not work on windows... ;)  \nStulle - (08:50): anyway, that's fixed now^^  \nStulle - (08:51): so the question remains, what is horribly wrong with my setup that keeps me from using that?!  \ncjdelisle - (08:53): Do you have the problem if the document name has no accents? It's a long shot but we might as well eliminate it from inquery.  \nStulle - (08:54): well, i am aware this can cause problems... that is why all my documents are saved in ASCII only chars  \nStulle - (08:54): without spaces or anything  \nStulle - (08:55): i mean the name is ASCII only  \ncjdelisle - (08:55): Ok, the document name in the error trace you gave had an accent in it.  \nStulle - (08:56): O\\_o it did???  \nStulle - (08:56): that was the wiki page  \nStulle - (08:56): [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\u00e4che  \nStulle - (08:56): anyway, it also happend on Sandbox.TestPage2  \ncjdelisle - (08:57): Ok.  \nStulle - (08:57): which was in it's original state upon test  \ncjdelisle - (09:20): Stulle, After looking at the code again, I see there isn't much information I can get from your error stack trace.  \nStulle - (09:21): i see  \ncjdelisle - (09:21): Faced with a problem, I would try setting up a new database (in postgres) and see if it works that way.  \nStulle - (09:21): okay, will do that later on  \ncjdelisle - (09:21): You can open an issue in jira and the least we can do is make it easier to debug in the future.  \nStulle - (09:22): btw, setting up the database worked a little different than described in the corresponding article  \ncjdelisle - (09:22): What was different and what was the article?  \nStulle - (09:22): at least in the latest version on windows  \nStulle - (09:22): well, the commands are not like that anymore...  \nStulle - (09:22): hold on  \nStulle - (09:23): IIRC, USER and cjdelisle GROUP are not valid like that anymore  \nStulle - (09:23): but it had some kind of user role thing  \nStulle - (09:24): yeah, login roles...  \ncjdelisle - (09:24): Did you use createuser and createdb?  \nStulle - (09:24): well, i made several attempts to be honest  \nStulle - (09:24): and in the end i think i made it entirely via the pgAdmin III GUI  \nStulle - (09:25): oh right and encoding is not UNICODE but UTF-8  \ncjdelisle - (09:26): Is there anything else in your log just before what you pasted? maybe something about a psql error?  \nStulle - (09:26): will test it again, hold on a minute  \nStulle - (09:30): http://pastebin.ca/1969686  \nStulle - (09:30): did the following  \nStulle - (09:30): went to TestPage2  \nStulle - (09:30): uploaded Blub.png  \ncjdelisle - (09:30): Nope, I can't get any info out of that.

I want to write a CSS filter (much like a XML SAX filter) to transfrom CSS selectors (namespace to prevent conflicts in portlet mode) and to rewrite @import URLs. I doesn't look complicated to write a CSS SAC writer but I'm surprised there's no library that includes one..  \ntmortagne - (10:06): sdumitriu: looks like you forgot to upgrade main wiki on myxwiki.org, http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=Groups does not work  \ntmortagne - (10:06): or at least part of main wiki  \nsdumitriu left at 10:07 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nsburjan - (10:11): tmortagne: I confirm that the bug has been fixed (tested the OO server) .. and it works from admin page. no errors in console even.

This is critical for 2.5 branch because sdumitriu was planning to release 2.5 final today.  \ncjdelisle - (10:36): That was backported to 2.5? I thought you said yesterday that the new version was not going to be backported.  \nvmassol - (10:37): hmm I wonder if we can enforce the use of JDK 1.5 during the release process by putting something in the pom.
