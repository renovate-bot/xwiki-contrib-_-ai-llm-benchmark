 \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: no I did not  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0namely it's the rollback after delete test that fails  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau worked on rollback at last BFD AIRW  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the one before actually  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems the failure started just after your pushes  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0could be that  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0o the 4th  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on the 4th  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0my push, not my commit  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and they're still the same now  \n12:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's probably the pull request merge  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(same error I mean)  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe something indirect?

From time to time, we need to test the full thing too  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one way is to cycle the environments when you test  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first time you test the full xwiki on env A, then next time on env B, then env C, then env A, etc  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that you don't increase the test times  \n16:39\u00a0<ldubost2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:42\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n16:42\u00a0<ldubost2>\u00a0is now known as <ldubost>  \n16:45\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has quit  \n16:48\u00a0<ldubost>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I don't see the jira project for the hierarchy macro on http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/BrowseProjects.jspa#10070 Maybe you didn't finish the creation of jira projects?  \n16:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: created projects only for active projects, I can't even find a component in contrib project for this extension  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: seems there wasn't a component for it!  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I did not looked at extension.xwiki.org and only created project for what seems active in jira contrib project  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll create a project  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but if you need to add a new issue yes the best is to create a new project for it  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any naming convention you used for the id?  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems not  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really  \n17:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I used the extension name for the project name generally  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for the project id it's hard to have a naming convention when you have so little characters allowed by jira  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah we can now rename ids, so we could prefix them with XC for XWiki Contrib for ex to avoid clashes, anyway let's wait for a problem  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(there is maximum 10 chars for the id)  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which ones did you create I don't see many new ones added?  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the authenticators?  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0pretty much all the projects that don't start with X  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you name one project you added so that I copy it?  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ADMINTOOL  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's limited?  \n17:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the id is limited yes if that's the question  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm we have XPEXOPLATFORM for ex  \n17:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was limited to 10 for the project I created  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe they reduced it after  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and seems to be the case with the new jira too  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed seems I can't add more than 10 now  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a010 is very low  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0weird  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe we can configure it  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey they use flavors now when creating a project ;)  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cool, we should setup one for contrib project since I had to configure them entirely with previous jira  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm you didn't set the workflow it seems  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nor permissions, etc  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why not use the existing ones?  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did use them  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't know why it lost it  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they seems to be set on admin tool  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"XWiki Workflow Scheme\" for permission for example  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did exactly what was on contrib project  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm that's pretty bad if the upgrade lost that  \n17:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure what you are looking at but they seems to be correct for me on http://jira.xwiki.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/ADMINTOOL  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I changed the workflow on admin tool  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I changed that one  \n17:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I set all of them for sure  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless the workflow was not listed with the other setup in previous version  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I compare each element of the administration with contrib project and did the same  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pfew they are correct  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the jira upgrade didn't loose stuff apparently  \n17:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but there was a lot less setup listed on the first page of each admin project in previous version so maybe the workflow was hidden somewhere  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't agree with Guillaume, the new admin UI is a lot better than the previous one  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what did you do for the version release dates?  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tried to find the dates  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah we can release without a date, cool even though not nice  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I found most of them  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for the one released on maven you look at maven repo and for the other the date of the attachment if it still exist  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still a bit messy for doing batch project modifications  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but now you understand what you are looking at...  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(well you cannot compare them easily)  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nor copy a project  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you know the diff between \"xwiki open\" and \"xwiki open for contrib\" for permission shcemes?  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no idea, just copied what was on contrib project  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did not really looked at them  \n17:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fixed all project, the only wrong setup were workflow and fields  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it's possible to script all this  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know they used to support some jelly scripts  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe they've upgraded to groovy now  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you talked about flavors ?
