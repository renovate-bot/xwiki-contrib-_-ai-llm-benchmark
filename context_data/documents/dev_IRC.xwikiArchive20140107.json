I already like the tool, althought i need to customise it. Is there a way (native or via plugins) to add a \"navigation tree\", but dynamic, so that when users add a page, it appears directly in the tree.  \n17:20\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0?  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Emenems: check http://extensions.xwiki.org you should be able to find several extensions there for your needs  \n17:28\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0vmassol, ok great. Ah, in \"Administration \u00bb Extension Manager \u00bb Add extensions\" I see that i can directly install extensions.
