Which mean each wiki owner would need to explicitly give edit rights on his wiki...  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correct?  \n09:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: depends what on the template, I think local user are given edit right so whatever you do at main wiki leverl won't have much impact  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm indeed only the owner is global  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it depends  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can have both  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how they've chosen to use their wiki  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but what I mean is that most subwiki already have explicit edit right given  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so by removing edit rigths I could break stuff  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so no ihneritance  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: are we sure?
