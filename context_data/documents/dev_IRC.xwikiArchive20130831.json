\u00a0To start, I tried the Windows .EXE but don't feel great about Jetty, since it's   \n21:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0don't feel great about Jetty, since it's|<-- you were cut off  \n21:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0To answer your question, linux is much better than windows because all things todo with servers have 99% of all testing done on linux, XWiki included.  \n21:38\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0continuing where I got cut off: \"since it's a web server I'd never heard of.\"  \n21:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh, jetty is actually a nice little webserver  \n21:38\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0I'm glad to hear that XWiki gets more testing done on Linux servers  \n21:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0most of the problems I find are related to tomcat which everybody uses  \n21:39\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Hmm...if I go with Linux, would you advise using a different container?  \n21:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Everything does, all of the XWiki SAS production buildouts are based on linux and for production you just want to go with what people use.  \n21:39\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Indeed. \u00a0That's exactly what I needed to know.  \n21:40\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Was my instinct, but then again, where I work, we host everything on Windows  \n21:40\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0(not my choice)  \n21:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Everybody likes tomcat, I personally think jetty is a fine and capable server.  \n21:40\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0OK; The volume on this thing isn't going to be super-high.  \n21:40\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Since it's an internal KB  \n21:41\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Would you say Jetty is likely to be more reliable / cause fewer issues for me than tomcat?  \n21:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0My personal favorite setup is to take the default XWiki .zip which is available on the downloads page, unzip it and edit hibernate.cfg.xml to change it to use mysql  \n21:41\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0ok; was planning to use mysql  \n21:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Jetty is nice because it's packaged with XWiki, we develop with it and run the automated tests on the CI server with it.  \n21:42\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0great. \u00a0since I work in tech support myself  \n21:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0We run production on Tomcat instances because that's what people use...  \n21:42\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0I see all of the problems that come from untested combos  \n21:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0But then my personal feeling is that Tomcat is \"just one more thing to maintain\"  \n21:43\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0and I want one thing less to maintain  \n21:43\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0longer-term would I need to do anything in particular to the mysql db?  \n21:43\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0(to maintain)  \n21:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0unless of course you're running a dozen other sites on a Tomcat instance and you want everything together.  \n21:43\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0right; my setup will be simple and serving 30ish people  \n21:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If you're going to be doing a lot of (large) attachments you might check out Filesystem Attachments  \n21:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's much easier to go ahead and do that right away than it is to migrate to it  \n21:44\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0I will consider that.  \n21:44\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Will be mostly screen shots  \n21:44\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0so guessing that might not be necessary  \n21:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If you decide you want to keep attachments in the db, you'll want to increase mysql max\\_packet\\_size  \n21:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think this is in the installation instructions  \n21:45\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0ah - ok. \u00a0I should probably go with fs attachments then; didn't realize by default it would keep files in the db  \n21:45\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Alright; sounds like I've got some work cut out for me. \u00a0Was nice to try the EXE and immediately get it set up more or less as POC  \n21:46\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0But I'll feel solid with it on Linux longer-term. \u00a0Will go with Jetty.  \n21:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah  \n21:46\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0It's Ubuntu and I could install the .deb's, but I get the sense it'll be better to do the manual install  \n21:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It's hard for me to say, they tell me the .debs work very well but I have been around since before they started being made so I tend to use the .zip  \n21:47\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0ok; then I'll try with the .debs first  \n21:47\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Upgrading generally OK with .debs too?  \n21:48\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0(for later)  \n21:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0upgrading can be a pain depending on how heavily you modify the wiki  \n21:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0as in how much scripting you do  \n21:48\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0will be little scripting  \n21:49\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0most I plan on is to have a query on one page to show the articles with the most ancient updates  \n21:49\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0so we can keep the info up to date  \n21:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0first you upgrade the wiki engine itself then you have to upgrade the default pages in the wiki  \n21:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Extension Manager helps with this but the technology is a bit new  \n21:49\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0hmm; well if you think it's not any worse starting with the .debs...  \n21:49\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0I'll cross the upgrade bridge once we get there  \n21:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, we end up with some ugly upgrade stories... but we also have a lot of wikis which are so heavily modded that they don't even look like XWiki anymore  \n21:51\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Yes, very flexible product, so I'm sure. \u00a0Mine will definitely stay as a normal wiki.  \n21:51\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0And I'll absolutely make sure to back up all the files and the db before touching a thing.  \n21:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so take it as you will.. I think for a simple wiki, the upgrade should be pretty easy but I don't want to mislead you if you end up spending a few hours on it  \n21:51\u00a0<CameronE>\u00a0Point well taken.  \n22:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:42\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:42\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
