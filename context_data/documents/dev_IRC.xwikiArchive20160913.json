Do we have a generic solution for using a Document Sheet that displays the doc content ($doc.content) but that still allows to use {{velocity}} macro \u00a0in the content? (without causing the nested script issue)  \n10:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0include macro  \n10:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0{{include reference=\"\" /}}  \n10:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the reference resolves to the current document  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"\" is going to be the doc having the document sheet binding object?  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since $doc points to it  \n10:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0\"\" is the document being displayed with the sheet  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's only one issue though  \n10:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0?  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but a small one  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0viewing that sheet raises a recursive error  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I'd need an #if to avoid it  \n10:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: using {{include}} is not safe because it means the right of the sheet author will be used  \n10:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, indeed  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I can use another include but it looks overkill  \n10:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed, there's a security issue with the include  \n10:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you have to trust the document content  \n10:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ideally we could need something like {{display sheet=\"false\"/}} that would do display on the document content  \n10:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/could/would/  \n10:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: we have $services.display  \n10:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but it produces html which is not very nice  \n10:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0true  \n10:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we need to improve ways to display and reuse content and properties, it's not so great right now  \n10:24\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau/mflorea: question for you.
