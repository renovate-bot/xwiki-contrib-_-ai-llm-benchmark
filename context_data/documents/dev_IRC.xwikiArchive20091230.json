;)  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:33): xwiki-bridge: well how do i start with ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:34): [glerouge] you install xwiki locally, you try following the FAQ application tutorial, write a simple application  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:34): what are the things which should be known to contribute to xwiki  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:34): ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:34): [glerouge] you look at the contributing section on dev.xwiki.org  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:34): and what are the languages i need to learn for xwiki?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:35): [glerouge] Java, velocity, groovy, html, css, javascript  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:35): well i am aware only of java and javascript  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:36): and little bit of html  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:41): [glerouge] sunny\\_slls : velocity is easy to learn  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:41): xwiki-bridge: ok so my first step would be to install xwiki on my system  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:42): and go through the code of xwiki  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:43): or should i go for lanugage and learn velocity and groovy and css  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:43): ??  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:45): xwiki-bridge: please bear with me , i am an ameteur coder   \nxwiki-bridge - (14:46): [glerouge] yes, that would be a good start  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:46): [glerouge] good luc  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:46): [glerouge] k  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:49): xwiki-bridge: which one?

 \nxwiki-bridge - (14:59): [glerouge] the .zip version works for Fedora  \nplunden left #xwiki at 15:01  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:01): ok  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:01): xwiki-bridge: thanks a lot  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:11): i can code j2ee programs in windows as taught in college how to do it in fedora or ubuntu as in windows the format was foldername->WEB-INF->classes->program.java \u00a0how can we do this in fedora  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:13): xwiki-bridge: i googled it but didn't get it  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:16): arkub: can you help in this?  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:17): or else i have to go for windows which i don't like  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:17): I run Fedora9, and I can run XWiki under jetty with Postgres.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:17): I don't think it's any different than windows.  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:18): can i install xwiki using comand line \u00a0yum install xwiki?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:19): I wish :) (I had thought about making an rpm package so you could do that but it would take time)  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:20): oops~!  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:20): CalebJamesDeLisl: i don't have jetty installed   \nsunny\\_slls - (15:21): well can you explain the above problem  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:21): Basically what you do is install jetty and postgres or mysql (with yum) then download the .war file and unzip it (it's really a zip file) and put the contents in a folder like jetty/webapps/xwiki  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:21): CalebJamesDeLisl: i can code j2ee programs in windows as taught in college how to do it in fedora or ubuntu as in windows the format was foldername->WEB-INF->classes->program.java \u00a0how can we do this in fedora  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:23): Are you familiar with the subversion version control program? (you can also get this with yum)  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:24): cvs?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [anamarias] sunny\\_slls : you can download the xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb <http://forge.objectweb.org/project/download.php?group\\_id=170&file\\_id=14080> and you won't have to install anything else (no jetty or database) from http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Download (they come in the package)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [anamarias] you unzip it and all you do is call ./start\\_xwiki.sh  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:25): ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:27): If you want to read the core code for XWiki, you can find out how to get hold of that here: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SourceRepository (that's where subversion comes in) \u00a0If you just want to run it, then what anamarias said.  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:28): CalebJamesDeLisl: ok thanks  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:28): CalebJamesDeLisl: but give me a min ..let me switch on to fedora .i am in ubuntu now  \nsunny\\_slls left at 15:34 (\"Konversation terminated!\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:48): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] nobody for 2.2m1 release date?   \nsunny\\_slls joined #xwiki at 15:49  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:51): Got fedora running?  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:52): CalebJamesDeLisl: yes  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:53): CalebJamesDeLisl: i have jetty in my services  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:53): but its dead  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:54): Now do you want to run XWiki on top of postgres/mysql or do you actually want to read/build the core code?  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:54): CalebJamesDeLisl: i would like to start from the beginning  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:54): Keep in mind that you can write script applications for XWiki without ever reading the core.  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:55): ok  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:55): i have seen that visualisations are also a part of xwiki  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:55): i have interest on Gui and visuals   \nsunny\\_slls - (15:56): can i work on it?  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:56): any areas provided  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:56): ??  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:56): I think everybody should have the experience of setting up the system with a database (like a real system admin)  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:56): ya that is necessary  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:57): so according to you where should i start with  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:57): ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:57): You can get around it by using the pre-bundled version but I think it's good to see how it works, understand security implications etc.  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:57): ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:58): If you want to work on user interface, most of what you do will not require compiling the source so you can use a war file  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:59): what are the things required to develop the user interface  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:59): ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:59): Velocity scripting language, CSS, HTML, Groovy scripting (Sometimes)  \nsunny\\_slls - (15:59): ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:59): Javascript  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:00): ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:00): I guess you start (If you don't want to use a pre bundled setup) with choosing a database.  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:00): just a min a call from home  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:01): just say \"Caleb\" and I get a pop-up message.  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:01): ok  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:01): i would like to go for mysql  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:09): sorry, i was attending a call from home  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: so for user interface i need to download the war file and study it \u00a0\u00a0right??  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:11): CalebJamesDeLisl: and for core development i need to download the zip file and install  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:11): right?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:11): No, you just need to download it and get it running, then you can hack away at user interface freely.  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:11): the war file?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:11): For the core code, you will have to download the source code (which is different) and then compile it using Maven2  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:12): CalebJamesDeLisl: can i use mysql database  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:12): ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:12): Sure.  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:12): ok i have it  \nsunny\\_slls - (16:13): CalebJamesDeLisl: sorry i have a limited internet package and don't have much MB letf to dowload the file  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:15): Satellite?
