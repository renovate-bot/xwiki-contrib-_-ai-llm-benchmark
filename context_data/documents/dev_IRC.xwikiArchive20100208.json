One has to specify the langth I see (or is that optional?  \nanamarias - (18:04): I could use directly the one in rendering module, but i understood it lacks some things this method in here doesn't  \nlucaa1 - (18:06): well, if there's one in the rendering module that does the same and you need it in some java code, then that's the one you should use, imho, and potentially fix the one in the rendering to cover the missing things...  \nlucaa1 - (18:07): ah, right, it makes sense now  \nlucaa1 - (18:07): anamarias:  \nlucaa1 - (18:08): actually wait  \nglerouge - (18:08): bblfish: yes, string should work just fine  \nlucaa1 - (18:11): anamarias: can you do a  \nlucaa1 - (18:11): mvn help:effective-pom > effective-pom.xml  \nlucaa1 - (18:11): in your command line and paste the effective-pom.xml result someplace?  \nanamarias - (18:13): lucaa1: here http://ana-s-private-labs.pastebin.com/d2648bf01  \nlucaa1 - (18:15): try to put this in your pom:  \nlucaa1 - (18:15): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<dependency> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<groupId>com.google.gwt</groupId> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<artifactId>gwt-user</artifactId> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<version>${gwt.version}</version> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<scope>provided</scope> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</dependency>  \nlucaa1 - (18:16): with ${gwt.version} 1.7.0  \nlucaa1 - (18:16): acytually since your wysiwyg is a 2.3-SNAP, it should be gwt 2.0  \nlucaa1 - (18:16): but  \nlucaa1 - (18:16): I noticed you use 2.1.1 core deps and 2.3 snapshot wysiwyg dep, why is that/  \nlucaa1 - (18:16): ?  \nanamarias - (18:17): wysiwyg dep is not in 2.1.1  \nanamarias - (18:18): releases  \nanamarias - (18:18): I fount it only in snapshots  \nanamarias - (18:18): 2.3 snaphot is more recent than 2.1.1 ? isn't it?  \nlucaa1 - (18:18): yes it is  \nlucaa1 - (18:19): but wdym it's not in releases?  \nlucaa1 - (18:19): for 2.1.1?  \nanamarias - (18:20): it's only here http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-web-gwt-wysiwyg-client/  \nanamarias - (18:20): but not here : http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/platform/  \nsdumitriu - (18:21): It's in com.xpn.xwiki  \nanamarias - (18:23): sdumitriu: xwiki-web-gwt-wysiwyg-client is not as a single module (http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/com/xpn/xwiki/platform/)  \nanamarias - (18:23): should I use a different version than 2.1.1 for core deps?  \nlucaa1 - (18:24): however, I would recommend you use the same version: wysiwyg is part of the platform, which has the same version when you'll install your component.  \nlucaa1 - (18:24): for example now, if you develop with 2.3 wysiwyg and 2.1.1 platform, your code depending on wysiwyg would compile against the 2.3 version (e.g. gwt 2.0) and your code depending on the other core deps will compile against their 2.1.1 version. When you'll install on 2.3, you'll run with a 2.3 core, when you developed with a 2.1.1, and the other way around  \nlucaa1 - (18:24): so chances are it wouldn't really work, depending on what you're using...  \nanamarias - (18:25): I don't need to use 2.1.1  \nanamarias - (18:25): should I use 2.3-snapshot for core too ?  \nanamarias - (18:25): or does it have to be a released version?  \nlucaa1 - (18:26): what are you developing for?  \nlucaa1 - (18:26): what are you planning to do with this code?  \nlucaa1 - (18:26): what code it is?  \nlucaa1 - (18:26): actually  \nlucaa1 - (18:26): depends on what you want it installed, in the end  \njvdrean left at 18:26 (Quit: Leaving.  \nanamarias - (18:27): a component for xwiki/google gadgets  \nlucaa1 - (18:27): well, it depends on what do you want it working  \nlucaa1 - (18:27): and \\_really\\_ it should not depend on gwt  \nlucaa1 - (18:27): (btw, is it working now?)  \nanamarias - (18:28): yup, it did build  \nanamarias - (18:28): i'll set the core to 2.3-snapshot for now and move it later  \nanamarias - (18:28): if it needs to  \nlucaa1 - (18:29): well if you put it to 2.3-SNAPSHOT, it can happen that it won't work with lower versions, depending on the API you use  \nlucaa1 - (18:29): if you use new API introduced in 2.3, then you won't be able to run it on 2.2  \nlucaa1 - (18:29): for example  \nlucaa1 - (18:30): generally we preserve APIs, so if you depend on 2.2 and use \\_only public API\\_ in 2.2 (no internal packages should appear in your imports), then it would work in 2.3 too  \nlucaa1 - (18:31): so now you need to make a choice about where do you want it to work  \nanamarias - (18:31): i have no idea, where should i want it to work :) ?  \nlucaa1 - (18:32): the general rule is: as many versions as better  \nanamarias - (18:32): if you ask me, i'd say current and next release, but i'm just guessing  \nsdumitriu - (18:33): tmortagne: Why did you delete http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Snippets/RestoreXWikiXWikiAllGroupSnippet ?  \nlucaa1 - (18:34): so if you can make it work from, say, 2.0 up to current version (meaning that you don't need specific API added in the newer versions), then it should be like that  \ntmortagne - (18:34): sdumitriu: it was a duplicate  \ntmortagne - (18:34): of http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Snippets/RestoreXWikiAllGroupSnippet  \nsdumitriu - (18:35): K  \nbblfish - (18:44): vmassol: I think what I need to do is really easy if someone knows their way around this.

But that seems a bit clumsy, though for a demo that could do  \nbblfish - (21:40): sorry one RSAPublic key having one identity field whose value is a URL (the user's url)  \nbblfish - (21:42): just need to tie a user to a list of keys, or a key to a user.  \nvmassol - (21:43): that'\"s easy  \nbblfish - (21:43): ah cool  \nvmassol - (21:43): just add RSAKeyClass objects to a user's page  \nvmassol - (21:43): you can add as many as you want  \nvmassol - (21:43): that's all  \nvmassol - (21:43): :)  \nbblfish - (21:43): I can do that dynamically?  \nvmassol - (21:43): sure  \nbblfish - (21:43): ah ok  \nbblfish - (21:44): where should I look for code for that?  \nvmassol - (21:45): http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome is a good place  \nvmassol - (21:45): there are code snippets too  \nvmassol - (21:45): let me try to find one  \nbblfish - (21:45): thanks a lot.  \nvmassol - (21:46): http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Snippets/RestoreXWikiAllGroupSnippet  \nvmassol - (21:46): it's done in 2 steps:  \nvmassol - (21:46): 1) you get a reference to the Document object:  \nvmassol - (21:46): $doc points to the current doc  \nvmassol - (21:46): othewise $xwiki.getDocument(\"Space.Page\")  \nvmassol - (21:47): 2) you call newObject on it  \nvmassol - (21:47): for ex:  \nvmassol - (21:47): #set($member = $allGroupDoc.newObject(\"XWiki.XWikiGroups\"))  \nvmassol - (21:47): \u00a0$member.set(\"member\", $userDocName)  \nvmassol - (21:47): 3) you set the values  \nvmassol - (21:47): \u00a0$member.set(\"member\", $userDocName)  \nvmassol - (21:47): 4) you save  \nvmassol - (21:47): $mydoc.save()  \nvmassol - (21:48): is that clear?  \nbblfish - (21:48): ok  \nbblfish - (21:48): I think that's enough to get me going  \nvmassol - (21:49): for step 2), it would be something like $mydoc.newObject(\"SomeSpace.RSAKeyClass\")  \nvmassol - (21:49): the api is available here:  \nbblfish - (21:50): ah thanks that helps yes  \nvmassol - (21:50): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/API  \nvmassol - (21:50): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/DevGuide/API/xwiki-core-2.1.1-javadoc.jar/index.html  \nvmassol - (21:50): so for a Document for ex: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/DevGuide/API/xwiki-core-2.1.1-javadoc.jar/com/xpn/xwiki/api/Document.html  \nbblfish - (21:58): $member.set(\"member\", $userDocName) is a hash map right, so you can only have one value for \"member\". In my case that should be \"key\" I suppose. So if I have a number of them, I should have key0 key1 key2 etc...  \nbblfish - (21:58): or perhaps I can just create a java.util.Collection() ?  \nbblfish - (22:01): ah I get it  \nbblfish - (22:01): the link is from the key to the person  \nbblfish - (22:01): ok  \nvmassol - (22:01): the string is the id from the class property  \nbblfish - (22:02): #rsakey = $mydoc.newObject(\"SomeSpace.RSAKeyClass\")  \nbblfish - (22:02): rsakey.set(\"member\", $userDocName)  \nbblfish - (22:02): sets a relation on the rsakey to the user  \nbblfish - (22:04): then later if I want to find all rsakeys assoicated with a user, I'll need to iterate over all rsa keys, and find for each one of them if their \"member\" relation is the user in question  \nvmassol - (22:04): you don't need that I think  \nvmassol - (22:05): you can just find the XWIkiUsers object located in the same document as the doc where the RSAKeyClass object is located  \nvmassol - (22:05): (unless you want them to be in different documents)  \nvmassol - (22:05): (in which case indeed you'd need a field to hold that information)  \nbblfish - (22:05): ah ok, so there is a notion of objects\\_in\\_a\\_document  \nvmassol - (22:05): objects are always in document  \nvmassol - (22:06): they kind of dynamic document metadata  \nbblfish - (22:06): it's very similar to rdf here btw  \nvmassol - (22:06): just edit any existing document in your wiki using edit objects  \nvmassol - (22:06): you'll see for example a tag object  \nbblfish - (22:06): in RDF an object is always named or spoken of in a document  \nvmassol - (22:06): if you add a comment to a document you'll see it's actually a Comments object added to the document  \nvmassol - (22:06): if you set a specific right on a document y'oull see it's actually a XWikiRights object added to the document  \nvmassol - (22:06): etc  \nbblfish - (22:07): hmm.. Ok then that makes more sense  \nbblfish - (22:30): ah yes, I noticed one can even add those objects using the UI.
