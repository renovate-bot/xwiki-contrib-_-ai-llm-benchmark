 \n20:34\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0actually I am interested if I can build a mvn2 project unsing mvn3 . is it backward ?  \n20:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It would be safer, since it's less probable to end up using the wrong version  \n20:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes it is  \n20:35\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0thanks.. I am also starting my dissertation project, and those tools still need maven 2  \n20:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hehe, I have both installed, and switching between them is as simple as  \n20:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0eselect maven set mvn-2.2  \n20:44\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I guess that's Gentoo Power :D  \n21:45\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:41\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:47\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:50\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
