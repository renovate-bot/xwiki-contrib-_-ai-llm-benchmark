 \n03:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It has this part correct?  \n03:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.xpn.xwiki.internal.export.OfficeExporter  \n03:42\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0yep  \n03:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not an expert on the office exporter but I can certainly take a look for you.  \n03:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Are you upgrading?  \n03:44\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0my real trace is http://pastebin.com/2tRQX0NL  \n03:44\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0and i'm using the XWiki Enterprise 3.1 from package  \n03:44\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0.zip  \n03:44\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-3.1.zip  \n03:46\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0on a debian squeeze with $ java -version  \n03:46\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0java version \"1.6.0\\_18\"  \n03:46\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.8.7) (6b18-1.8.7-2~squeeze1)  \n03:46\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0OpenJDK Client VM (build 14.0-b16, mixed mode, sharing)  \n03:46\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0i'm not upgrading, it's right out of the .zip  \n03:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That is odd, I wouldn't expect that to have any problems since it's tested pretty carefully before it's shipped.  \n03:50\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n03:51\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0oh part of the pb is probably because of a bad manipulation on my part, i first used a java 1.5 by mistake, i tried again right now after a really clean unzip and it's still not working but the trace has changed  \n03:51\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0so i'm already 1/2 sorry for bothering and preparing to be fully sorry when i realize i made another mistake :p  \n03:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok the 1.5 thing explains why a random class which is there appears to be missing.  \n03:54\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0new trace is http://pastebin.com/WRvzrhWq  \n03:55\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0and /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/i386/xawt/libmawt.so does not exist in my fs  \n03:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://www.thetacticalnuke.com/2008/12/tip-fix-java-not-finding-libmawtso-ubuntu-810/  \n03:58\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0i'm trying it  \n04:01\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0ok now it's making a pdf, but title on the first page and at top of each page is : $msg.get(\"xe.dashboard.wiki.spaces\")  \n04:01\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0i'll continue to investigate tomorrow :)  \n04:01\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0many thanks !  \n04:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you want to export pdf documents I highly recommend using the OfficeExport function where it uses OpenOffice to do the pdf generation.  \n04:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That just means starting OpenOffice/LibraOffice server and connecting to it.  \n04:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Once they are connected, your regular pdf export will be OpenOffice powered.  \n04:07\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0ok then i'll try that  \n04:08\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0thanks again, and good night if it's night at your place :)  \n04:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Thanks  \n04:15\u00a0<RenJuan>\u00a0has quit  \n04:15\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has quit  \n04:31\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n04:32\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n04:32\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n04:33\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n04:48\u00a0<obiwlan\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n05:17\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n05:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n07:54\u00a0<vmassol\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:55\u00a0<vmassol\\_>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n08:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n08:10\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:30\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:49\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:49\u00a0<RenJuan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:49\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:15\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:16\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n12:21\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n12:21\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n12:37\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:08\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:09\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan`>  \n14:41\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:51\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n17:00\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<obiwlan\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<obiwlan\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:39\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:39\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:39\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n22:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:40\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
