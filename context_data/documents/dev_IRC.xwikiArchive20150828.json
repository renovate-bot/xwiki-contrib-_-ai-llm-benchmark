Note that the copy/rename operations are still synchronous. I've added the ability to select the target document using the tree, but we still need to make the operation async and display the progress bar.  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: do we need this for 7.2?  \n11:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we'll do this as a next step, either before 7.2 final or after, depending if it's important  \n11:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the only problem is when you copy/rename a document with losts of nested docs  \n11:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0i.e. it takes time and you don't see the progress  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's definitely a usability issue  \n11:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, but it's visible when you perform a big refactoring  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it shouldn't be hard to add the progress bar. Guillaume added it for the delete operation. We can do the same for the copy/rename  \n11:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for copy/rename it's even easier because the operation is triggered from a Velocity template, not from oldcore (e.g. DeleteAction) so easier to modify (nothing to compile)  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok if we can do it in RC2 then good  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0RC1  \n11:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'll create the jira issue  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: what's your ETA on your 2 issues for M3?  \n11:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0re XWIKI-12176, I've created a document \"picker\" that is used by the create/copy/rename UI to select the target document, but for view mode we've just used the breadcrumb. i.e. the document \"displayer\" in view mode is the #hierarchy($doc) macro.  \n11:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0this works fine for the create/copy/rename UI when we display the source document, but it may not be good for the live table for instance  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then we neeed a new jira issue maybe for the remaining work?  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found a bug with wiki macros in nested spaces when you restart xwiki, debugging  \n11:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, for the view part, but we need to decide if we want to reuse the breacrumb to display a document location (in a livetable for instance) or something else  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: do you want to take that investigation?  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found the problem for wiki macros, fixing  \n11:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: talking to Marius to see the problem  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n11:54\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: \u00a0the create action UI is done, Marius will commit his latest changes, so I`m left with XWIKI-12320 that I`m looking into today  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n12:27\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n12:27\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:29\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:29\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I canno't create a subwiki on master  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's still running and it's solr failing  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/90d22dfb678c8e422ef0/raw/36d035e90b81bfe35ccb8b7552820d8269fa8197/gistfile1.txt  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note: I had a breakpoint I didn't notice so that's why it was not progressing  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still reveals some issue with the solr indexing happening too early or something like that  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I've restested and it's not a problem of speed  \n12:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I always get the SOLR issue, going to raise an issue  \n12:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: could this be caused by some permission change you did: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12453 ?

 \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: did you work on breadcrumb in 7.2M3?  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you know the problem  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying on 7.2M2  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW platform tests are better but sitll 7 failing: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/1762/#showFailuresLink  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok it's a 7.2M3 issue only (there was no breadcrumb on home pages in M2)  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so this issue was introduced by either GD or Enygma` :)  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found an issue: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12407  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commenting in there  \n16:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: that`s because you see there: The main wiki (home icon), pretty name of the wiki (which you set the same as the wiki ID) and title of the Main space  \n16:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0XWIKI-12407 just displays the title of the main space  \n16:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and Marius recently added the wiki pretty name, if you are in a subwiki  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the home and the wiki are the same  \n16:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so, technically, it`s expected behavior  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we should only have one or those not 2  \n16:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0home icon is for the main wiki homepage  \n16:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0not the current wiki homepage  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(home of a subwiki)  \n16:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I don`t follow  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you're on test:Main.WebHome for example  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the link to the subwiki and the link to Main.WebHome are the same  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm actually they could be different  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in 99% of the cases they are the same  \n16:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you will see: [home icon] / [pretty name of the \"test\" wiki] / [title of the Main space]  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and this is the problem  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and if you click one or the other they lead to the same place  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that's very confusing  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same name + smae link  \n16:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we are reflecting the document hierarchy there  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not really  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki home == Main.WebHome by default  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's duplicated  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway let me say it differntly  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no user will agree that displaying (home icon> > Test > Test) makes sense when on the home page, especially as when they click on Test or Test it leads to the same place  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need something better  \n16:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the homepage can have a different title  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(even if technically we think it's correct)  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it still is the same link!!!  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the homepage can be set to anything... that homepage's space webHome can have a different title from the wiki pretty name  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we wanted to remove magic from the breadcrumbs  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i'm really -1  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you create a new wiki you get a duplicate  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is not understandbale  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need something better  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it looks 100% like a bug  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when you're a suer)  \n16:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when you get to use the wiki you understand why it is like that and work with it  \n16:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: check the main wiki, you have <Home Icon> / Wiki Home  \n16:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0both point to the same thing  \n16:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0in the breadcrumbs you always have the current document`s reference hierarchy  \n16:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we no longer have the top menu  \n16:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so we need to have the clear navigation in the breadcrumbs  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then we should not set the subwiki home page to be named as that subwiki  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we should use Wiki Home then  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again from a user POV it's a no go as it is now  \n16:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0see XWIKI-12423  \n16:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, for me the issue is that the home page has the name of the wiki  \n16:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that issue introduced the webhome`s space's title  \n16:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0otherwise the breadcrumbs is not correct  \n17:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and you end up with home / Welcome ... and welcome is not a top level document  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok creating a jira issue to change the a subwiki home page name  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*title  \n17:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0to what? :)  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Wiki Home  \n17:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we should think about this a bit. It's not that bad to see the pretty name of the wiki on the wiki home page (as its title), but indeed this makes the breadcrumb look bad  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then why not do the same on the main wiki?  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a problem of consistentcy too  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12459  \n17:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0then you will have issues for the breadcrumbs of a Nested Document under the \"Main\" space  \n17:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0[home icon] / subwikiX / Wiki Home / Doc 1 / Doc 2  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I see that if there's no pretty name we use Wiki Home  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's wrong with your example Enygma`?  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you said it was corredct above  \n17:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if you change the homepage of the wiki  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(correct to have both the subwiki + home page)  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you chang e the home page that'll just change the link of subwikiX right?  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's the same for the main wiki I guess  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I see it's the terminology that causes issue: the \"home\" in \"Wiki Home\"?  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have the same problem with the main wiki  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you want a name that means \"Main document\"  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not \"wiki home\"  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because wiki home is the wiki part of the rbeadcrumb and not the main space part  \n17:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the issue I mentioned above is that in [home icon] / subwikiX / Wiki Home / Doc 1 / Doc 2, \"subwikiX\" will link to the new homepage but \u00a0\"Wiki Home\" will always link to Main.WebHome in the current wiki and it will not be \"THE wiki's home\"  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's what I said above I think  \n17:12\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need the pretty name of the main space  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of \"Wiki Home\"  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we just said that the home is a mapping that can changed to anywhere else  \n17:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but \"Wiki Home\" is the pretty name of the Main space  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whihc is wrong  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as you said  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the Main space is not always the wiki home  \n17:15\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Welcome\" could make sense  \n17:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Just checking ScriptRight blocks {{html}} right ?  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Main\" would be the logical choice but it's not very friendly. \"Welcome\" as the pretty name of the Main space may be more naturla  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we could rename the \"main'\" space we would rename it to \"welcome\"  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we can't, but we can change the pretty name  \n17:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: no  \n17:18\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0cjd: no  \n17:18\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0just script macros  \n17:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh ok so {{html}}<script> is still allowed  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it only block Velocity basically  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this right is about server side script  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: AFAIR thomzs delafosse worked on taht  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*thomas  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember if he committed it or not in the end, I think he did  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cleaning html content is a different subject and yes thomas worked on that  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no I don't think he commected anything on that subject  \n17:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah but you can't exactly break {{html clean=\"false\"}}  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember seeing the code but maybe it was in a PR only  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: I'm not talking abaout clean=false  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i'm talking about cleaning html in general  \n17:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok, you're talking about stripping \u00a0<script> and onload, onreadystatechange, on\\* attributes  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thomas delafosse did an impl of that  \n17:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0things like this yes, that's what thomas tried to do  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0based on tagsup if I recall right  \n17:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm writing a reply to James to try to explain the situation WRT $doc.save()  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah foud it  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7878  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm that's anderas  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*andreas  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7878 is not about html  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's about indicating that you don't want to execute script macro and html macro completely  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes indeed  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's XDOM level cleaning basically  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0strange I can'tfind any open PR from Thomas  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(about this)  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are 4 open but they're about something else  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm not sure he had time to do one  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm sure he did something  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember reviewing the code  \n17:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0he worked on it yes but I don't think he finished  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes maybe he didn't do a pr  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need someone assigned to http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12457 ?
