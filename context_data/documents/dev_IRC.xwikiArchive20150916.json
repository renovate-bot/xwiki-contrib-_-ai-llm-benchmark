I've been at it for two weeks now, and I can't seem to get anything up aside from the standalone package on centos7  \n17:47\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0I also noticed the tutorials for tomcat deployments are bit outdated, I mostly run into the 11007 error, where xwiki is either stuck connecting to the rdbms (mariadb) or stuck initializing at 50% (on postgres)  \n17:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Are you already running tomcat for other purposes on the machien ?  \n17:54\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0no, this is being run on a vm only for xwiki  \n17:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Ok, personally the way I would do this is #1 download the .zip instance of XWiki, #2 unzip it into a directory, #3 edit the hibernate.cfg.xml to point to mariadb  \n17:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0start it up and then download the .xar for the main XWiki Enterprise pages and import them.  \n17:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Different people install XWiki differently, that's my method and I know that one to work.  \n17:56\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0okay, and this could still be done with the standard mysql jdbc connector?  \n17:56\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0or is that not a factor when using the .zip  \n17:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0do add the jdbc jar to the unzipped directory  \n17:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0actually before you tear down what you have, just paste the error in your browser to https://encry.pt/ and maybe it's something I know the error well  \n17:58\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0My other question is can I have Jetty from the .zip run in the background similar to tomcat? The VM becomes uninteractive when running the \"start\\_xwiki.sh\" script to host xwiki, unless of course it is permissible to run the standalone on a production enviroment  \n17:58\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0Will do, thank you cjd.  \n17:59\u00a0<Chuguniy|2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:00\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0You need a restart-in-case-of-failure mechanism either way, for that you might consider looking at xinit.sh (google: XWiki xinit)  \n18:00\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:01\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n18:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well I'm heading home, maybe you can join the [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) mailing list and discuss the issue there  \n18:03\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0Thank you for the help, I will continue to troubleshoot this on my end with what you have told me.  \n18:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the standalone zip distro is no good in a production environment, but that is only because of the database it uses (HSQL) - you can reconfigure it to use mySQL instead (and then reinit all the data, of course ...) and that should be ok, except maybe for high load stuff  \n18:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I found the debian package installer is also quite painless, but only works on debian, of course ...  \n18:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0what is the 11007 error, actually? I have to admit I never seen it  \n18:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0which tutorials are actually the outdated ones, and why are they outdated? (I tend to think they are fine, but then I likely miss the stepping stones out of habit, so it would be nice to know where they should be improved)  \n18:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: I think he was referring to http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation#HTutorials  \n18:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, yes, mayeb, these external tutorials migth be updates; better use \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationWAR \u00a0\u00a0:)  \n18:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, bioGen\\_X already gone :(  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n19:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:06\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:18\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:19\u00a0<bioGen\\_X>\u00a0Hi, not sure if my previous message sent, but the tutorial that was outdated was a link to another website from xwiki, the tomcat tutorial is up to date that is hosted here.
