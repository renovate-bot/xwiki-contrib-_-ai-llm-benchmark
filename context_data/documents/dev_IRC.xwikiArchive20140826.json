(so it runs only one node, but for example round-robin style)  \n09:03\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:30\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0not sure what you are asking  \n09:34\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0well, for example part of this component is used for synchronizing user groups and it runs periodically (so for example it runs every 24 hours), if i put this component on all cluster nodes, it will run 3 times instead of one, but if i put this on one node only, it couldn't run at all (that node will fail for example)  \n09:36\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0so far i've came up with two ideas -> reusing zookeeper / reusing jgroups (randomize run period and if component receive some custom event it will mark as \"finished\" and just wait again, if component runs, it fires this custom event)  \n09:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n10:05\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: vmassol Enygma` : can I restart jenkins?  \n10:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: not yet  \n10:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ll do it shortly  \n10:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok thanks  \n10:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no problem for me  \n10:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau, mflorea: please see my message from yesterday on skype re the wysiwyg test and headings in flamingo.  \n10:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(issue with the bold operation on headings)  \n10:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: seen it, but I can't help right now  \n11:01\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:29\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:30\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0hello, i really hope someone can help me figure this one out: we have 2 (supposedly identical) installations of xwiki enterprise 5.2.1. One of them starts with document mode: IE9 compatibility mode and the other does not.  \n11:33\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0any quick win tips that might help me solve this browser/webapplication riddle are very welcome  \n11:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0martin77: if the server are identical, any chance it is a setting in the browser ? I remember IE has some domain-based settings for going into compatibility mode, and if the user sets them, the browser obeys  \n11:38\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0martin77: look into templates folder, file htmlheader.vm  \n11:39\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0i verified the vm file  \n11:41\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0clemensr: im sure ie can/offers to do a lot of wicked stuff, but i need more specific pointer what could possibly cause my browser to switch xwiki into compatibility mode  \n11:41\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0for example  \n11:41\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0then look into webpage source (ctrl+u in chrome/firefox) and lookup for line that sets the compatibility mode  \n11:42\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0thatd be F12 for IE :)  \n11:42\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0and you refer to doctype ?  \n11:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0in the head there is \u00a0the \u00a0<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" /> \u00a0(or should be)  \n11:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the user settings are in the \"Internet options\" ... I always forget whee exactly, if you start looking for them sure you will find them quicker than me  \n11:44\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0the metacontent is set to xua compatible and ie=edge  \n11:44\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0on both  \n11:45\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0that'd mean its not the page that determines the document mode ?  \n11:46\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0so with this can we confirm the document not being the culprit ?  \n11:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think so. If the user forces IE into compatibility mode, the server cannot prevent that.  \n11:46\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0users force nothing :)  \n11:47\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0its either a gpo (maybe an old one i dont know it does something with IE (bad docs))  \n11:47\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0or something in the xwiki config files  \n11:47\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0i cant think of other reasons to explain the difference in our situation  \n11:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I remember I had a similar problem once, and it was a browser setting: XWIKI-9746  \n11:52\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0i compared xwiki cfg, xwiki properties and hibernate cfg  \n11:52\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0nothing except the obvious different database, etc  \n11:53\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0compare templates, thats where could be the difference (otherwise it's really IE issue)  \n11:55\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0ok  \n11:55\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0all files on both servers in /templates have original timestamp  \n11:56\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0pretty safe to exclude as well  \n11:58\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0excluded our internal webproxy  \n12:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0what about http headers? isn't there x-ua-compatible as well?  \n12:03\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0yes it is in both xua compatible  \n12:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0martin77: if the <meta> tag is \u00a0not enough  \n12:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you should try sending X-UA-Compatible in the HTML header too  \n12:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0something like response.setHeader(\"X-UA-Compatible\", \"IE=edge\")  \n12:07\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"/>  \n12:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0that you put in the headers via the administration  \n12:07\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0thats there... unchanged (ootb)  \n12:08\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0and from what i understand this comes from the template vm, right?  \n12:08\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0those templates are unchanged too  \n12:08\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0so it cant explain the different behaviour imo  \n12:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0what are the domains on the 2 wikis?  \n12:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0actually it is \"#set($ok = $response.addHeader(\"X-UA-Compatible\", \"IE=XXX\"))\"  \n12:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0actually it is \"#set($ok = $response.addHeader(\"X-UA-Compatible\", \"IE=Edge\"))\"  \n12:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the different behaviours can be explained if one of the 2 domains is listed in the \"intranet sites\" of IE  \n12:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:13\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0yea im trying to find the option for IE to show the zone it put the site in. i thought used to be in the lower right corner in the status bar  \n12:18\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0found it. Zone: Local intranet, protected mode: disabled (both)  \n12:19\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0so both urls... i just type: xwiki/xwiki \u00a0or xwiki-acc/xwiki/ \u00a0. are both in local intranet, protected mode: disabled  \n12:20\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0both are in the same domain / dns zone  \n12:20\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0no global names used  \n12:20\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0no wins  \n12:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0then I don't know  \n12:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but just try to \u00a0write #set($ok = $response.addHeader(\"X-UA-Compatible\", \"IE=Edge\")) just after <meta ...> in htmlheaders.vm  \n12:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0maybe it could help  \n12:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there is a separate setting in the \"Extra > Compatibility view\" in the IE menu  \n12:25\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0there is, but no sites have been added  \n12:25\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0its empty  \n12:26\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0man this is frustrating :) it feels it cant be THIS tough  \n12:26\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0the only difference so far is different subnet  \n12:27\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0however i excluded the proxy doing weird stuff with zones maybe.  \n12:27\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0verified the zone on both the pages are loaded in  \n12:29\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0gdelhumeau. the reason im not willing to accept/try your suggestion to change the .vm template is because it works fine on one of the two servers  \n12:29\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0and both files are identical  \n12:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes sure, it is better to understand \u00a0the root cause  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:17\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0lol  \n13:17\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0if i type xwiki/xwiki -> compatibility mode  \n13:17\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0if i type xwiki.fq.dn/xwiki -> normal mode  \n13:17\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0wtf  \n13:27\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe \"display intranet sites in compatibility view\" is switched on ?  \n13:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: hello  \n13:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0fyi there's a horizontal scrollbar when migrating to the latest snapshot: http://s2.postimg.org/7ijvjirl5/scrollbar.png  \n13:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: mflorea1 would probably know better what this could mean  \n13:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or maybe it's caused by flamingo move some way  \n13:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks!
