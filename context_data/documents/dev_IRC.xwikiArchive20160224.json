The test is failing due the incompatibility of the parameter's type used in the $services.mailsender.send() method with the needed one (javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage).  \n08:50\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0In XE 7.4.1 the $services.mailsender.createMessage() method returns an object of org.xwiki.mail.script.ScriptMimeMessage class (available \u00a0since 7.1M2) which extends org.xwiki.mail.internal.ExtendedMimeMessage which extends javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage, so it's the proper parameter type and it works being used in the .send() method.  \n08:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0In XE 6.2 the $services.mailsender.createMessage() method returns a org.xwiki.mail.script.MimeMessageWrapper which extends directly javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage but it doens't work being used as parameter in the .send() method.  \n08:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0My questions are:  \n08:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Why org.xwiki.mail.script.MimeMessageWrapper can't be used as paramether in .send()?  \n08:51\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Should the org.xwiki.commons version be upgraded in the application's pom to 7.1 in order to have org.xwiki.mail.script.ScriptMimeMessage?  \n08:52\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0What other possible options to fix this issue do I have ?  \n09:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:44\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:00\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Hello  \n10:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0New blocker detected: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13134  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed not very nice  \n10:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I've discovered it while working on the migrator  \n11:05\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n11:58\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:14\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has quit  \n12:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:25\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:50\u00a0<KwootAtWork>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:51\u00a0<slauriere>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:52\u00a0<slauriere>\u00a0has quit  \n14:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:49\u00a0<KwootAtWork>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:06\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:54\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:23\u00a0<meatcar>\u00a0@item(buffers):button1  \n22:34\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has quit  \n22:40\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0has quit  \n22:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:22\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
