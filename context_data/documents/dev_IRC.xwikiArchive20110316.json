Of course the user could just save all the necessary documents by clicking on it or doing a right click and choo \"save as\". This is rather annoying, though. So what I am looking for is some sort of checkbox infront of the attachment where I would be able to choose which documents to download and then press download and I get for exampl  \n12:45\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0irc message sizes are limited. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"press download and I get for exampl|<-- cut off here  \n12:46\u00a0<Guest2518>\u00a0....example a zip file with all the requested documents....  \n12:47\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Creating a zip file from a group of documents.

Not all config props are related to L&F. Now, if we agree to put in in a group other than Applications then it's ugly because right now ConfigurableClass doesn't allow you to specify a group (all configurables are automatically placed in the Application group).  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: all I know is that it looked strange to me that it was in the Applications section  \n14:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it was put there automatically because I used the Configurable xclass  \n14:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see there also \"Search Suggest\" which is neither an application  \n14:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Message Stream will be there too  \n14:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0IMO the best group for WYSIWYG editor among the existing ones is \"Configuration\" but I can't place my section there without modifying the administration sheet, excluding my configurable object from the list of configurable apps that go in the \"Applications\" group.  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: maybe that's something to improve for 3.1 but it seems we need \"Configurable\" feature to support specifying the config category somehow  \n14:12\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: could you review this: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise30M3#HFilesystemAttachmentStore ?  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm maybe xwiki.store.attachment.recyclebin.hint=file is needed too  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: actually doesn't work\u2026 I have my logs filled with http://pastebin.com/XfHVmQbr It never stops  \n14:43\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/TestReports/ManualTestReportXE30RC1 do you test the new features?  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie the ones listed in the release notes  \n15:28\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: ofc. give me 10 minute and it will be ready,so you can take a look  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n15:46\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi going to deploy jmock 2.6RC2 on our remote repo since it's not on central  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(jmock 2.6 is the version that is compatible with junit 4.7/4.8)  \n15:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: There's a failing test that you should solve, did you know?  \n15:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: yes I know  \n15:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i was refactoring the tests to not use remote repositories anymore but I found a blocker bug in aether repository  \n15:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The fact that you can't read the packaging type?  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: yes  \n15:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that make the repository module try to download jar files instead of xar files when trying to install a xar  \n16:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0@all : http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/TestReports/ManualTestReportXE30RC1  \n16:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0you can start fixing or closing  \n16:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I haven't got the change to test yet wysiwyg admin section.
