Of course I didn't manage  \n10:54\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I add an XWiki.SheetClass on my page with Default Edit Mode = inline  \n10:56\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0In fact, I try te redirect user on another page when he want edit my page  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so I'll start the 7.4.4 release process now  \n11:08\u00a0<meatcar>\u00a0has quit  \n11:08\u00a0<meatcar>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<meatcar>\u00a0has quit  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: quick question why did you do http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-457 for the 7.4.x branch too?  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: so that someone can install it on >8.2 and have it fully working (since I removed the mediawiki parser from wikimodel)  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean someone on 7.4.4+?  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. if you want old mediawiki parser you can simply install the 7.4.4 one  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again the issue is that I removed mediawiki wikimodel parser from 8.2  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand how backportinf it to 7.4.4 make it work for people installing it on > 8.2  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because > 8.2 don't have any mediawiki wikimodel parser anymore  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you need the parser to come with mediawiki rendering parser module itself  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still don't get it. I've done the same for markdown but I've not backporeted it to 7.4.x  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*backported  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have to remember that there is two parts required to parse wikimodel  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0one part is a javacc parser located in wikimodel module and the other is the wikimodel -> xwiki events converter  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and I remove the javacc parser from wikimodel  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so if you install xwiki-rendering-syntax-mediawiki 7.4.3 in 8.2-SNAPSHOT it won't work  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because it won't find the javacc parser  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you could have put it in that module or have a dep on it  \n11:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is \"that module\" ?  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in xwiki-rendering-syntax-mediawiki 8.2, you could have had all the required parts to install it in XWiki 8.2+  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki-rendering-syntax-mediawiki 8.2 does not exist  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's been deprecated and moved  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I mean the new module id  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I don't know its extension id)  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0new module = new module for the mediawiki syntax  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what new module id ? I don't plan to release a new version of the deprecated xwiki-rendering-syntax-mediawiki, if you want it you can simply install the 7.4.4 one which is working fine with 8.2-SNAPSHOT  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is not the point here  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the new mediawiki parser does not care about javacc or wikimodel  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm talking about someone that would want the old parser behavior for some reason  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I understand. But you could have released that javacc-based parser in 8.2 only no?  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since that's when you removed it from rendering)  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see the point in keeping this javacc parser we don't want to maintain  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we deprecated the mediawiki parser so I moved the javacc part with it  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I don't see is why we want people using 7.4.4 to use that old stuff  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as some separate module  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not a separate module in 7.4.4  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of having it as before for 7.4.x inside rendering  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did not do that for 7.4.4  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the RN I have http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-457  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(RN for 7.4.4)  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did that for someone that want to install the old mediawiki parser in 8  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a08.2  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0thanks to XRENDERING-457 all he have to do is install xwiki-rendering-syntax-mediawiki 7.4.4  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I don't understand but nevermind, Iw as just curious and wanted to make sure it wasn't a mistake  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not a mistake apparently so I trust you to have done the right thing :)  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you could add a comment on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-457 just to understand why there's a fixfor of 7.4.4?  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at first look it seems strange to do that in a bug fix release)  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: removing a spam is as simple as clicking delete in your mail tool but it's still annoying. Imagine xwiki.org with 10 subwikis and having to close the tour 10 times whenever you go to each subwiki. Better show it once only in the use case of intranet IMO. Don't you agree?  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errrr  \n11:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I see  \n11:46\u00a0<acotiuga1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome is empty for me  \n11:46\u00a0<acotiuga1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0same here  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it says I did something  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I didn't ;)  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Added backward-compatiblity violations data\"  \n11:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0could you try to rollback?  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've rolledback but I don't know where this is coming from  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could come from the backwardcompat macro used in the RN  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the message seems to indicate that  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0doc.save('Added backward-compatiblity violations data', true)  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it seems there's a bug in that macro  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone forgot to remoeve the agent 1-1 key on his github account  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the last RM  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: ?  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0github tells me \"Key is already in use\"  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems to be working but might be better to remove it  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does anyone remember if I need to import translations for 7.4.4? I vaguely remember something  \n12:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0Enygma is in a meeting, so not able to respond.  \n12:05\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0we said we don't get translations for 7.4.4. since lots of things changed for 8.x  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember we mentioned on this chat that we'll need to have some transaltion for a bugfix release not long ago  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but maybe I dreamed it  \n12:07\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: in http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleasePlans/ReleasePlan743 you didn't updated them  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes in general we should never do that  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0except when it's absolutely required :)  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I remember now  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it was the key that was changed by Edy  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in the end Edy updated the translations and kept the key breakage  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so right now it means that in 7.4.4 we have bad translations for the rename ui for French and some other language  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I do need to selectively update some translations I think  \n12:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I don't know about this topic  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pfeww I'm glad I'm remembering it  \n12:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes there was a key change  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here:

strange then  \n12:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0re translations, there were some fixes that should be included in 7.4.4  \n12:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for the rename UI  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup see

weeks  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone had muted it\u2026. :(  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok thanks  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll let you handle this step of the release process

#xwiki  \n19:33\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0hello, is it possible do have the table of contents of the current wiki page in the side bar menu?  \n19:40\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0currently I have siblings and children  \n19:40\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0but I would like to have also the content  \n19:46\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0panel toc  \n19:46\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Aison: it's not really possible right now becuase the toc is for the current page  \n19:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the panel is a dfiferent page  \n19:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-240#  \n19:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you can have autotoc for each page, requires some custom config though  \n19:47\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0yeah, I dont like autotoc :P not because it is bad, but if you scroll down it is no longer visible  \n19:48\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0but somehow siblings and children is working also as panel  \n19:48\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0and this is also related to the current page  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the document tree macro and the livetable are made to display children and siblings for a given page  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is not the case for the toc macro  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you cannot pass to it the name of the page for which to generate the toc  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see the jira issue I pointed to above  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it wouldn't be hard to do but it's not done  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nobody has had a storng need so far :)  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*strong  \n19:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's probably about 3-4 lines of scripting  \n19:51\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0hmm  \n19:54\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0other question: can I configure how tables are rendered?  \n19:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0everything's possible. If you need to configure the CSS, please see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/SkinExtensionsTutorial for example  \n19:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Aison)  \n20:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or custom skin but SSX are better for this simple use case)  \n20:21\u00a0<Aison>\u00a0ok, thx  \n20:36\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n22:24\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:11\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:45\u00a0<Chris[m]>\u00a0has quit\n"}
