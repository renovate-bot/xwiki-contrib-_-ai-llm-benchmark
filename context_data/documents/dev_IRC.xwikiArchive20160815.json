 \n21:41\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0if you guys could get a top notch ticketing system to integrate with xwiki, that would be sooooo much more leverage to use  \n21:41\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0suite of products  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n21:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed a ticketing system is something that's been itching me for a long time  \n21:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually we have a s simple one  \n21:42\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0xwiki as a standalone wiki is superb, but integrating it into other tools can be a bit less than stellar  \n21:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's not meant to compete with jira  \n21:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Task+Manager+Application  \n21:43\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0yeah; \u00a0thats where you guys are losing out to atlassian the most though; \u00a0most enterprises use the atlassian 'suite' -- confluence, jira, bitbucket/stash, bamboo, etc  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"integrating it into other tools can be a bit less than stellar\" the jira integration is not nice?  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0atlassian is mostly for devs  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our target is not devs  \n21:43\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0very good point  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I mean not specifically)  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're targeting all parts of companies  \n21:43\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0but but... its a better dev tool than the 'dev tool' \u00a0lol  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0HR, etc  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n21:44\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0i \\*hate\\* that confluence has gone cloud only because the addon support has gone the way of the dodo now :\\  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you do have lots of extensions for their cloud offer but they're quite expensive AFAICS  \n21:45\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0well, they are also very restrictive on what can be used on the cloud platform  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n21:45\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0in a 'standalone' environment, you dont have to worry as much about cross contamination of other topologies and products  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're really cloud only now?  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(didn't know that)  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can't download and install confluence in premises anymore?  \n21:45\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0they have their on demand (cloud), and they do still have the on premise  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're just pushing for cloud but still offering on prelises  \n21:46\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0but its far less encountered now, \u00a0most companies dont want the burden of managing their own platform  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*premises  \n21:46\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0exactly  \n21:47\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you tried http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Task+Manager+Application ? (I haven't ;)). Don't know how good/bad it is. It's supposed to be a simple task maneger if you're need are small. For complex needs, the best is to use a product made for task mgmt (and integrate it with xwik, as we do with jira)  \n21:47\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0not yet, ill take a look at it though  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/you're/your  \n21:48\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0but it looks like my team went to have lunch without me, haha  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah sorry for holding you :)  \n21:48\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0ill bb; \u00a0going to go join them in the cafeteria =D  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bon appetit  \n21:48\u00a0<mmercer>\u00a0nah, \u00a0i feel bad that youre in here instead of enjoying your last day of sanity :p  \n21:48\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0hello  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n21:48\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0anyone knows what this error means [XWiki initialization] ERROR c.x.x.XWiki \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Failed to initialize mandatory document  \n21:48\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0?!  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0watching the olympic games at the same time...  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hakin: hi, you need to proivide the root error  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or you can pastebing the whole error and I'll get it for you  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*pastebin  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's the innermost error)  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(caused by...)  \n21:49\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0it's gigantic  \n21:49\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0but com.xpn.xwiki.XWikiException: Error number 3202 in 3: Exception while reading document [xwiki:XWiki.WikiMacroParameterClass]  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't paste here then ;)  \n21:50\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0Caused by: org.hibernate.HibernateException: Unable to get the default Bean Validation factory  \n21:50\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0sorry  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0look at the root \"cause by\u00e9  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"caused by\"  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ok to paste 1 line  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just don't paste the full log :)  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lol  \n21:50\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/NAdhzN4f  \n21:50\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0hehehehe  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it seems you have a problem in your hibernate.cfg.xml file  \n21:51\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0what seems to be the problem ?!  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hibernate fails to initialize from reading the hibernate.cfg.xml file  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't say....  \n21:52\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0I'm using pgsql  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should compare your version with the default version that comes with xwiki  \n21:52\u00a0<hakin>\u00a0the default use HSQl right !?
