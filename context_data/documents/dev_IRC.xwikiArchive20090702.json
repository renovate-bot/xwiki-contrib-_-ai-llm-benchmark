(02/07/2009 18:32): what about the #footnote macro?  \nmarta\\_ - (02/07/2009 18:32): (you said you had a question)  \nmarta\\_ - (02/07/2009 18:33): ... about an hour ago...  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:33): yep  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:33): when using it in syntax 2.0 there are 2 issues:  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:34): \\* since it's not a rendering macro one needs to use {{velocity}}{{html}}#footnote(\"\"){{/html}}{{/velocity}} which isn't very convenient  \nmarta\\_ - (02/07/2009 18:34): yes, well, this macro will be deprecated soon  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:34): \\* when used, it inserts a white line between the part of the sentence that comes before and the one that comes after  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:35): deprecated, not updated ?  \nmarta\\_ - (02/07/2009 18:35): there's a {{footnote}} rendering macro on sergiu's computer  \nmarta\\_ - (02/07/2009 18:35): waiting to pass ckeckstyle and be committed  \nglerouge -

(02/07/2009 18:38): But that requires some changes in the rendering process  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:38): So it will have to be postponed as a known issue  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:40): the issue with included documents is related to the footnote one ?  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:40): Yes  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:41): ok  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:41): The problem is that footnotes have the same ID  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:41): so if I have footnotes in document A, and footnotes in document B  \nmarta\\_ - (02/07/2009 18:41): uhm, yes, there's an issue with the footnote macro when called in both the including doc and the included doc  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:41): And A includes B in a new context  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:41): they're gonna collide  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:41): Then the footnotes will have duplicate IDs  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:41): And they won't point to the right location  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:41): Yes  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:41): ok  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:42): what about the LaTeX plugin integration btw, is it going fine? ;)  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:42): But I think this scenario is rather unlikely  \nsdumitriu - (02/07/2009 18:42): I haven't looked at it lately  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:42): yep, I think it's better to have that macro with the issue that not have the macro  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:42): ok  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:42): do you know when you'll be able to look at it ?  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:42): we're gonna need for a customer in the coming weeks  \nglerouge - (02/07/2009 18:43): and it's been asked for by a number of community members too  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 18:49  \nglerouge left at 18:50 (\"Gone chasing a unicorn in the twilight zone\")  \njvelociter left at 18:54 ()  \nmarta\\_ left #xwiki at 18:54  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:05 (\"Leaving\")  \njvdrean left at 19:19 ()  \nEnygma` left at 19:25 (\"Leaving.\")  \nkaaloo1 left at 20:15 (\"Leaving.\")  \nflorinciu left at 20:34 (\"ChatZilla 0.9.85 [Firefox 3.5/20090624025744]\")  \narunreddy left at 20:38 (Remote closed the connection)  \ntmortagne\\_ left at 20:50 (\"Ex-Chat\")  \nkaaloo joined #xwiki at 21:32  \nkaaloo left at 21:51 (Read error: 113 (No route to host))  \nkaaloo1 joined #xwiki at 21:51  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 22:40  \nanamarias left at 22:44 (Client Quit)  \nguillaum1 joined #xwiki at 23:08  \nlucaa1 joined #xwiki at 23:09  \nkaaloo1 left at 23:10 (\"Leaving.\")  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 23:15  \nxwikibot joined #xwiki at 23:23  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 23:27  \nvmassol left at 23:32 ()  \ncristinas left at 23:33 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))  \ncristinas joined #xwiki at 23:39  \n\n"}
