I think my problem is that I worry a lot and I'm rather bad at expressing my concerns in a coherent way.  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you're definitely not an \"asshole\"! :)  \n10:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Well I appreciate the complement  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd really like that we work on your main pain points with xwiki  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which are also the pain points of a lot of us  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like the slow build  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we know stuff that we could do, we just need to do them now...  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0somehow there are always stuff that comes up and take precendence\u2026.  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we don't progress as fast as we would like...  \n10:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'd like to talk about the things which worry me at some point, I'm afraid that given I'm here at the office every day, my time to do things which are not assigned is not going to be available...  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like FTM I've trying to pinpoint the issue with creation of hundreds of wikis  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this has taken me 2 days so far  \n10:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0:(  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's complex as I'm delving into the HSQLDB code  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it doesn't reproduce all the time, so it's slow work  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: yeah I know the feeling, it's ok, everyone helps as much as they can, given their business schedule  \n10:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Anyway, my concerns are a bit more meta, things like \"what will the next 5 year bring\", \"what is the plan for getting from here to there\"  \n10:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I spend a lot of time projecting the future which means I spend a lot of time worrying :)  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good luck with that, predicting the future is hard :)  \n10:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sort of yes, sort of no  \n10:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0IMO  \n10:51\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Hello devs. can someone point me to the XAR for 3.1 XEM ?

 \n15:08\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0I found $xwiki.usertools which seems light in functionalities  \n15:09\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0And $services.wiki.user in the 5.3 but seems dedicated to subwikis (but seems to have functionalities that I need)  \n15:09\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0Is there anywhere else I should look for?  \n15:09\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0j-simard: user id is the name of a page so you can simply test if the page exist  \n15:14\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0OK, seems a simpler solution to test existence, and I suppose that create the page yourself is simple too to create a new user...  \n15:14\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0I'll try that, thanks  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0creating a user is a bi more than just create an empty page  \n15:14\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0Only need a XWikiUser object?
