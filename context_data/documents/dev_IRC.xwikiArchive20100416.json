Selective Export and Multi page Export? :)  \nvmassol - (14:29): for me it's the same  \nevalica - (14:29): one is letting you see the space and select the pages ... and the other is using the search feature to select the pages?  \nvmassol - (14:29): it's one feature  \nvmassol - (14:29): then we need to decide the options we want to have  \nvmassol - (14:30): to select the pages/spaces  \nevalica - (14:30): I need to know if I just need to remake the UI from the Multi page export - to be in the colibri style ... or I need to think of another interface  \nvmassol - (14:30): we should define a spec first probably  \nvmassol - (14:30): and agree on it  \nvmassol - (14:31): maybe you could prepare a first version evalica?  \nglerouge - (14:31): there are 2 parts  \nglerouge - (14:31): \\* selecting a set of pages  \nsdumitriu - (14:31): evalica: Differences are in UI/UX mostly  \nevalica - (14:31): I could gather some specs  \nsdumitriu - (14:31): They do the same thing in the end  \nglerouge - (14:31): \\* deciding wht to do with those pages  \nvmassol - (14:32): glerouge: wdym by the second part? is there something else than exporting them?  \nglerouge - (14:32): vmassol -> from a user pov exporting a XAR for a backup and creating a composite PDF document isn't exposed the same way in the UI I guess  \nvmassol - (14:33): for the selection indeed, it could be a bit like the insert link UI with tabs for: tree, recent pages you've navigated to, search  \nevalica - (14:33): for the PDF export should we include the options glerouge add in his PDF export panel?  \nvmassol - (14:33): then you click a button to move the selected pages to the target list of pages to export  \nglerouge - (14:33): caty -> that's part 2 (deciding what to do with the pages)  \nvmassol - (14:33): and yes this should be the same UI for PDF, RTF, XAR, etc  \nglerouge - (14:34): step 1 is deciding what to export, step 2 is deciding what to do with the selected pages  \ntmortagne - (14:34): +1 for common selection tool  \nglerouge - (14:34): (export them as PDF with their comments, export them as a XAR with backup pack etc)  \nvmassol - (14:35): we'll need to decide if we want new export actions at the level of the space and wiki menus  \nvmassol - (14:35): or whether we offer single export actions in the wiki menu for example  \nvmassol - (14:36): and then pre select the current page for ex  \nevalica - (14:36): should we have some link in the menu that say: \"Add page to export list\" ?  \nglerouge - (14:36): evalica: so for now you can start with a proposal for an interface allowing to select multiple wiki documents (it's a tough one already, specially for big wikis)  \nvmassol - (14:36): evalica: IMO it's a dedicated UI  \nvmassol - (14:36): (not add page to export list)  \nglerouge - (14:37): vmassol: could be both  \nvmassol - (14:37): glerouge: I really don't see how that would work  \nvmassol - (14:37): you'd need to store the list somewhere  \nvmassol - (14:37): and it's clumsy as a usage IMO  \nglerouge - (14:37): a bit like a basket on an online website  \nglerouge - (14:37): I agree that it's not the first one I would have thought about either  \nglerouge - (14:38): back to the multiple document selection UI -> it's a tough one, specially for big wikis (we've seen how the tree behaves)  \nglerouge - (14:38): (or, more accurately, how the tree does not behave)  \nvmassol - (14:38): idea too: use a livetable to select pages  \nvmassol - (14:38): (in order to do the filtering easily)  \nglerouge - (14:39): vmassol: that's a suggestion for the selection of pages, maybe there are better ones  \nvmassol - (14:39): filter then click add to add all selected pages, repeat  \nevalica - (14:39): vmassol: I think there is no UI - that you haven't propose to use the livetable :)  \nvmassol - (14:39): evalica: right :)  \nglerouge - (14:39): lol  \nglerouge - (14:39): he likes generic components  \nvmassol - (14:39): I really like the filtering ability  \nsdumitriu - (14:39): Livetable + select all this page, select all matched pages  \nvmassol - (14:39): and yes I do like generi stuff  \nglerouge - (14:39): sdumitriu: yes, adding bulk actions to the livetable is the next step  \nglerouge - (14:39): select all,  \nglerouge - (14:40): + actions  \nglerouge - (14:40): (like gmail)  \nvmassol - (14:40): next step = ? I think we should consider an extended livetable for this use case  \nglerouge - (14:40): it would be useful for the export, for delete too  \nglerouge - (14:40): vmassol -> the next option to add to the livetable  \nvmassol - (14:40): meaning that maybe it's time to improve the livetable now for this use case  \nglerouge - (14:40): (as if it didn't already have enough)  \nvmassol - (14:40): rather than do this use case and later improve the livetable  \nglerouge - (14:41): the livetable has already been imported a lot lately  \nglerouge - (14:41): and it's use cases are only going to grow so indeed maybe a refactor could be good  \nsdumitriu - (14:41): s/imported/improved ?  \nglerouge - (14:41): imported -> improved  \nglerouge - (14:42): (another feature I've been asked for is export the current livetable selection as an Excel file for instance)  \nvmassol - (14:42): glerouge: like jira ....  \nglerouge - (14:42): evalica: good luck now ;)  \nevalica - (14:43): :) thanks  \nvmassol - (14:44): the good thing of Livetable vs tree is that the livetable scales, the bad part is that you can't navigate hierarchically  \nvmassol - (14:45): so one tab with livetable, one tab with tree, one tab with search  \nvmassol - (14:45): :)  \ntmortagne - (14:45): could be a livetree :)  \nvmassol - (14:45): yes livetree for the tree tab  \nsdumitriu - (14:45): We need to rewrite the tree anyway  \nvmassol - (14:45): seriously the 3 tabs might not be a bad idea  \nvmassol - (14:46): since there's no a single way to find information  \nvmassol - (14:46): s/no/not/  \nevalica - (14:47): and we need 3 tabs just for the selection part ...  \nvmassol - (14:47): yes htat's the left part  \nvmassol - (14:47): the right part is the aggreated list of spaces/pages to export  \nvmassol - (14:48): and the bottom part are the export options (for ex)  \nevalica - (14:48): and then we need the export options / type ... xar, pdf (include what ...)  \nevalica - (14:48): yeap  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 14:48  \nvmassol - (14:48): evalica: I think we'd have different UIs  \nvmassol - (14:48): but using common parts  \nvmassol - (14:49): well I don't know  \nvmassol - (14:49): we could decide to have a single unifying one for all exports too  \nvmassol - (14:49): I'm neutral  \nevalica - (14:49): k .. thanks ..
