know where it is?  \n09:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's part of beanutils AFAIK  \n09:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not work ?  \n09:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I never used it myself so I may have been wrong  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking my depedency:tree  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I do have beanutils and it's not found  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by our commons properties converter  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Caused by: org.xwiki.properties.converter.ConversionException: Failed to find a Converter to convert from [java.lang.String] to [java.util.Properties]  \n09:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok then I mixed with something else, anyway should be easy to implement but if you are in an extension it won't help you  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW I've done a quick impl of my converter yetserday  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I'm talking about here is for another need  \n09:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/jira/blob/973d38d4562a0f075a0171e42a0e6fc844fdf5f1/jira-macro/jira-macro-default/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/jira/macro/internal/FieldParser.java  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's hard to make something generic out of it  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I should probably have used parboiled but I need to get more familiar with it  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a nice tool for creating parsers  \n09:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tihnk I can use the List Converter first and then parse each list entry  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the Properties use case)  \n09:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it won't be the same syntax  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my need is:  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a=b,c=d  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no  \n09:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then Properties parser won't cover that  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it won't work  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I know  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm it could  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was thinking about quotes but we don't need them around a or b  \n09:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is it for a macro parameter ?  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"some key = some value\", c=d  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should work  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's for a generic 'parameters\" macro parameter yes  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise I can just reuse the custom parser I coded yesterday  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's very similar  \n09:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it would be weird to have a List type for a parameter which is supported to be a map, I think you should either user String and parse it yourself or find a map like type for it  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I'm just using a string ATM  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the parsing is done in the macro  \n09:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok then you don't need converter  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for yesteday's need it was too hard to define a structure  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not very hard but unnecessarily complex  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now for this use case  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's more generic  \n09:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes looks generic  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we could imagine a generic parser thay could be contriuted back  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for others to use too  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0especially since we do have the need to already in others macros I think  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah? you have one in mind?.  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was looking for such an example  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think I remember some macro taking a map and doing the parsing internally  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't remember which one, would have to search  \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(not a macro I did)  \n09:41\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hi, You can not use jsontools? http://maven.xwiki.org/site/docs/xwiki-javadoc-4.1.x/org/xwiki/velocity/tools/JSONTool.html#JSONTool%28%29  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can search for map in \\*PArameters classes  \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't find it because map is not supported  \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it will be a String parsed by the macro  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right and the parsing is probably done in the macro impl class  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and passed as a string  \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n09:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: doesn't chart macro have a parameter like this ?  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a different format but yes  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I see params which is \"Additional parameters for the data source\"  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a:b,c:d  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think that's the one I remember  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so similar  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but maybe it's not marsed by the macro itself but b the lib it's using  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/marsed/parsed/  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do parse it  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that's another need  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0format is:  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a:b;c:d  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very simple parsing  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but a theorical need because we can't really change the syntax of this macro parameter now  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not supporting quotes  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/ee06a667263747eb8e4741b926b4ec23653acf73/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-chart/xwiki-platform-chart-macro/src/main/java/org/xwiki/rendering/internal/macro/chart/ChartMacro.java#L205-L205  \n09:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on a different topic I think we need to use the {{cache}} macro for all extensions pages with release notes  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and stop displaying all release notes)  \n09:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think we need cache macro but we should load the release note asynchronously and have pagination probably  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another idea is for the jira macro to be async but it would be nice to add generic supoprt for async macro  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/would be nice/would be nicer  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know you had a jira issue on this  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but no time to work on it  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0e.x.o is really slow for pages with release notes  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this one is taking real long for me: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/CKEditor+Integration  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like 5-6 seconds  \n09:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what should be async is maybe the jira macro actually  \n09:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is not much RN on this extension  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes thre are worse but even that is already slowing down a lot  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*there are worse ones  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes the jira macro should be async  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it would be nicer if we had generic async support for macros instead of coding is specifically just for the jira maro  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*macro  \n09:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0TBH I was hesitating coding it for the jira macro since I'm on it but have refrained so far\u2026 ;)  \n09:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure a generic macro would be nice but I think jira macro should probably always be async  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but you would do the work twice  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0once for making the jira macro async and oncre more to have a generic mechanism  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not exactly the same work  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure it's very different  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically you execute the macro rendering in a thread and you have some js to inject the result in HTML  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0making jira macro async is about displaying a json coming directly from jira server while generic async macro is about rendering asynchronously a wiki content  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which btw can causes issues for our exporters if htey don't support js)  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0its not really possible to rewrite the jira macro to execute in js  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if that's what you mean)  \n10:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it would be more or less about making jira macro use livetable and have the custom livetable source convert jira json into xwiki livetable json  \n10:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but yes it's a very different implementation  \n10:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but most of the work is in writing a custom jira livetable source  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I was thinking about adding livetable support as a source  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0err  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not source  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0displayer  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now we have 3: enum, list, table  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was contemplating adding a 4th one: livetable  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's a bit different than async support  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which you could want even for the other displayers  \n10:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well it does give you async so that's a start  \n10:08\u00a0<moep>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:08\u00a0<moep>\u00a0has quit
