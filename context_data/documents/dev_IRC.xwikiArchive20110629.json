Sorry for the repetitiveness but wasnt sure if anyone had responded to it. \u00a0Thank you for any assistance.  \n13:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: ok, thanks  \n13:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: according to the \"Fix Version/s:\", sdumitriu fixed XE-950 for 3.2M1 so it's probably expected that it's not fixed on 3.1  \n13:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0hm.. my bad. Could you close the issue ? because I tseted on 3.1, not on trunk  \n13:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you don't have right to close it ?  \n13:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and I will re-open it if the issue isn't fixed  \n13:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0shold I close as Fixed ?  \n13:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*should  \n13:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well that's what it was before you reopen it, right ?  \n13:57\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n13:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so yes close it as fixed if it's fixed ;)  \n14:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: good news, I can reproduce with your instructions, should be quickly fixed  \n14:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: cool. is it hard to fix ? I am curious about what was wrong  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is something wrong in the way right is tested for existing macros at startup but I will need to look at it in debug mode to find out what exactly, you probably found a bug in the right service itself  \n14:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0anyway.. it seems to affect from 2.7 -> 3.1 .. so we should also commit on 3.0 branch because it is still maintained  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea about that we need to release 3.0.1 and get rid of this branch  \n14:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I see, well.. glad I was able to reproduce it and now it's gonna be fixed  \n14:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well... I guess there will be a 3.0.2 also .. so dunno if we're getting rid of it so fast  \n14:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: we released 3.1 so the stable branch is now 3.1, whatever is found after 3.0.1 is released there will be no 3.0.2 version  \n14:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a03.0.1 release is just late  \n14:52\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well.. you know better. but we had 2.7.2.. I guess we will have also 3.0.2  \n14:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it has nothing to do with the version  \n14:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a02.7.1 was released before 3.0 was released  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and there was fixed things after it so we released them in a 2.7.2  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we are not stoping to support a branch when there is a x.x.2  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we are stopping when the next major version has been released  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but again 3.0.1 is just late and was planned already before 3.1  \n14:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, you know better.  \n15:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: FYI it's indeed a bug in right system itself  \n15:21\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i guess it's good we found it.. who know what other stuff could trigger on a wiki  \n15:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n15:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0at least this bug restraint right, it should not add more  \n15:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes ...  \n15:35\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0incubator.myxwiki.org is down - is there any sys admin who can take care of this?  \n15:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: where is the xwiki log written now? I can't find it under jetty, nor under tmp and neither under the home folder.  \n15:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: on jetty I have no idea, it did not changed for tomcat  \n15:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(I never use jetty)  \n15:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you still have it on the console ?  \n15:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm trying to find the (full) log on the ci agent  \n15:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha  \n15:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I know I can see it on the web interface  \n15:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sorry I don't know about file log in jetty, even when I use it I usually only look at console output  \n15:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n15:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'll keep searching  \n15:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the issue is that tests hand in agent 1 and 2, and it always happens when running ui-tests but there is nothing logged in the console (at least from what I can see in the web UI) to indicate the problem. More over I can wget pages when logged on the agent so XE is running but selenium tests are not executed  \n15:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0s/hand/hang  \n15:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: it probably mean the problem is in test itself  \n15:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0especially if you can navigate XE  \n15:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so i doubt you will learn what's wrong from XE log  \n15:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the issue is that from the log I can't tell which test is rnning  \n15:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0selenium tests and wysiwyg tests log the test name on the console  \n15:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0could you give be the link to the log ?  \n15:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests-3.1/246/consoleFull  \n15:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0thanks  \n15:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0lots of loginsubmit requests  \n15:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0indeed looks like we lost ui test logs  \n15:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that itself seems wrong to be  \n15:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0if you scroll up \u00a0from the bottom you can see \"Running org.xwiki.test.ui.AllTests\"  \n15:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes but we are supposed to have detailed log of what is done by the test AFAIK  \n15:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what test is running etc.  \n15:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't know. I usually run ui-tests from eclipse so I didn't notice the log  \n15:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but I know for sure that selenium-tests and wysiwyg-tests have a more detailed log  \n15:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe I actually remember it like if it was th same as selenium1 tests  \n15:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but then we should enabled it  \n15:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise it's very hard to know where is the issue  \n16:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if not impossible  \n16:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n16:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0a pity http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests-3.1/ws/xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/target/surefire-reports/org.xwiki.test.ui.AllTests.txt is not filled during test  \n16:01\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep, I looked there too  \n16:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm there is something wrong with rendering tests, jenkins indicate that they are not executed  \n16:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-rendering/275/  \n16:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0chekcing if it's really true, maybe the display is wrong  \n16:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since running test require a profile  \n16:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's ok, I can see it's executed  \n16:18\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0I'm currently using the following in a panel: \"#set($bookmarks = \"$xwiki.getUserPreference('bookmarks')\")\" \u00a0It seems to return the \"bookmark\" preference (which is a textbox, identical to the Address preference) for the user just fine, but the formatting is a little weird whenever I have a wikilink in there. \u00a0Any ideas why that is, or is there something I can do about it? \u00a0I'm thinking maybe the textbox is saving the info formatted, and then the .get  \n16:18\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/e6wdAE9W \u00a0<-- example of what I see in the panel's source  \n16:19\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0mflorea: thanks for having try anyway, for sure my user has, so it could happen again. Have you seen my recent XWIKI-6754 ? have you any comments in regards to the WYSIWYG editor, in particular for livetable that I should know about while fixing this ?  \n16:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0let me check  \n16:32\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Denis: WYSIWYG editor code is \\*not\\* loaded deferred (check the wysiwyg\\_import velocity macro from macros.vm) and also it doesn't listen to xwiki:dom:loaded event (it has its own mechanism to detect when the code is available, Wysiwyg.onModuleLoad(someFunction) ). So I don't think XWIKI-6754 affects the WYSIWYG editor.  \n16:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:49\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:52\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:07\u00a0<qwebirc97671>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<qwebirc97671>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:14\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0Can anyone help with getting field validation setup? I have checked out the tutorial but still cant get just basic validation check and message to appear. Any suggestions?  \n18:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0what type of field validation are you using?  \n18:27\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Does anyone know why we are doing https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-administration/src/main/resources/XWiki/AdminRightsSheet.xml instead of just pasting the content of rightsUI.vm inside XWiki.AdminRightsSheet?  \n18:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: not really no, I guess it used to be possible to access right UI directly as template (maybe it's till possible) and duplication is always bad  \n18:29\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0@cjdelisle: sorry, im relatively new to all this..what do mean what type?  \n18:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0can you link to the howto which you are using? There are a couple ways to do validation.  \n18:33\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0can someone restart the incubator.myxwiki.org?  \n18:33\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0@cjdelisle: Yes, i believe so. In the class I just want to define with a regex, say for someone to follow a specific format for ID, and the message to appear when they try to save and its not valid  \n18:34\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0@cjdelisle: seems like something simple, like $doc.validate() should activate it, but im obviously missing something or several things.  \n18:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So you have a regex and it still allows users to type things in when editing the page which they should not?  \n18:36\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0correct  \n18:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think the post form is supposed to have a hidden field which submits validate=1 when the user clicks save  \n18:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0do you have the link to the tutorial?  \n18:39\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0yes, http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Creating+a+form+with+validation+and+tooltips  \n18:39\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0but if i add in the <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"xvalidate\" value=\"1\" />, it dosn't read it correctly with syntax 2.0  \n18:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0try {{html clean=\"false\"}}<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"xvalidate\" value=\"1\" />{{/html}}  \n18:44\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0Okay, tried that..and now its just not allowing you to save the new page created using that class? Strange  \n18:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I should mention that you are using a very old method of validation which is not much used anymore.  \n18:47\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0ahh okay so it is working.  \n18:47\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0lol can you tell me of a better method then?  \n18:48\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0it is working but just does not allow it to be saved if incorrect, but no Error Message appears.  \n18:48\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0A newer way would be helpful, definitely.  \n18:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The way XWiki.Registration does it is to let the user type into a form which it creates then it uses script to validate it.  \n18:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's reasonably modular too so you could probably just go ahead and copy/paste it to make yourself a form.  \n18:56\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0Okay im looking at the registration code... ill let you know if i can figure it all out :)  \n18:57\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:58\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:00\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0Is there any way for me to preserve line breaks in a panel? \u00a0The info is entered via the WYSIWYG, and if it's displayed anywhere else, it's correct but in a panel, it strips the linebreaks.  \n19:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0try using enter twice instead of once  \n19:02\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0No go. \u00a0Still strips them.  \n19:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not sure on that one.  \n19:04\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0Rats. \u00a0Thanks for the attempt.  \n19:16\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0Anyone else have any ideas?  \n19:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0is there something thats a more simple model than the xwiki.Registration?  \n19:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<qwebirc98840>\u00a0maybe a validation example that doesn't have all user login/permissions requirements?  \n19:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:29\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n20:29\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<jvelociter\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:35\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<jvelociter\\_>\u00a0is now known as <jvelociter>  \n22:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:13\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:40\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:55\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
