 \n17:39\u00a0<orogor>\u00a00.00001 ?  \n17:40\u00a0\\*\u00a0orogor looks for the excat version string  \n17:41\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0core plugins are at 5.0.3  \n17:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so the LDAP authenticator is bundled  \n17:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can still install an older version of the LDAP application  \n17:42\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0the plugin manager allows me to install it  \n17:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in details you have \"stable versions\"  \n17:42\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0would it break stuff if i install the ldap application ?  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can't install the last version  \n17:43\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0i install the 5.0.3 ?  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it requires a more recent version of XWiki  \n17:43\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0ok  \n17:44\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0but for hr ldap app , i install the 5.0.3 , so i can just frefresh and not restart the wiki ?  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the LDAP application is just a UI, installing the 5.0.3 version of the application should not change anything  \n17:46\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0humm, it doesn t read the conf from the file  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless 5.0.3 is too old (don't remember) you should get a button to reset the cache from the UI without restarting anything  \n17:46\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0yes, i get it  \n17:46\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0but the rest of the plugin doesn t show the config i have on the text file  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it does not read th conf from the xwiki.cfg, it set the configuration at wiki levelm  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's overwritting what's on xwiki.cfg  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(if you set something)  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in other words it's not exactly the same configuration, it's setting LDAP properties for the current wiki only while xwiki.cfg affect the whole farm  \n17:48\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0humm doesnt \u00a0seems to work , it says requested ressource isn t availlable  \n17:52\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0tmortagne, i confirm , thats a 404  \n18:05\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0haa , the page calls 127.0.0.1  \n18:15\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0and the app doesnt \u00a0support ssl or tls  \n18:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0tmortagne, apparently that was a very bad idea  \n18:32\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0now peoples can t logina nymore  \n18:33\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0i tried removing \u00a0the plugin, the still the same  \n18:33\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0and restart  \n18:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0orogor: you sure you did not set any property ?  \n18:33\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0the only session that works are the ones that are still closed  \n18:33\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0i tried to set them,but that didnt worked  \n18:34\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0should i resinstall the plugin and remove all the properties ?  \n18:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n18:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since you are using xwiki.cfg you should not set any property at wiki level  \n18:36\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0ok, i think it works  \n18:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n18:39\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0ok , i now re-uninstalled it  \n18:39\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0i saw it reload the user list in the ldap log when i removed the confs from the plugin  \n18:40\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0it scans all users atonce, but not when they login  \n18:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I assure you the authenticator only do thing during login  \n18:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you also have automatic login if your credentials are in the cookie  \n18:43\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0in ldap logs \u00a0i see the password being verified at login for existing users  \n18:44\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0but if the user didnt \u00a0existed before startup , i see only a bind with the proxy account, and no search for the user that tries to login  \n18:45\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0proxy account binds, do nothing, then exit  \n18:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again you have a group cache so it's cached in the some previous login  \n18:45\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0but group cache should expire no ?  \n18:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends on your configuration  \n18:46\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0you speak about ldap group cache right ?  \n18:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n18:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as you can see in xwiki.cfg the default is 6 hours  \n18:47\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0it s set at 30min here , and group cache work \u00a0i ve seen the number of user change  \n18:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also in old version of XWiki like yours the cache expire only after not being accessed during 6 hours, not after being created  \n18:48\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0the number of user in group  \n18:48\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0haaaaaaaaaaa  \n18:48\u00a0<orogor>\u00a0i supose i can t change this ?
