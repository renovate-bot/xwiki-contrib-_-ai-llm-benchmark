Are you around ?  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorinello: Hi, I'm here  \n15:44\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0vmassol, I saw a thread on the devlist regarding some issues with certain yahoo emails [Lots of disabled Yahoo email addresses on the xwiki.org lists]. I have a problem with my gmail account on the userlist, but it seems to be a different one and I didn't want to hijack or pollute the thread  \n15:46\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0This is the second time I get an email like this: http://pastebin.com/GBPTTG7L  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the same problem  \n15:47\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0ok, just wanted to let you guys know .. so seems gmail is also affected  \n15:47\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0sorry for the noise :)  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't really know how to fix this. Sergiu suggested some ideas on the list but it's not been acted on yet  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm sorry for the trouble  \n15:48\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0no problem, the fix is jost one click away. The only inconvenience is that if users do not check regularly their emails, they will not get any mails from userlist until they click the link  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, I'm sure we lost a lot of subscribers because of this :(  \n16:50\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:56\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:39\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:17\u00a0<moep>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n23:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit\n"}
