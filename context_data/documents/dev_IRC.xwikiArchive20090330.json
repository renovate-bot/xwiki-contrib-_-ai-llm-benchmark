Is there a way to show swing UI \u00a0from those menus?  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:11): what do you mean with my own UI? (smth independent from UNO?  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:11): Yes, there is a way to integrate swing  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:12): they have only an example which is kind of complicated .. but i think i will manage  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:12): great  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:12): the example is in the sdk folder, so unfortunatelly I can't you it to you  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:13): \\*show it to you  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:13): \"you own ui\" -> custom UI created by you. Eg: Login to XWiki wizzard.  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:14): yes I've understood now  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:16): you'll have to give some time(about one day or so) to digg a bit into this technology so that I could better help you.  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:16): btw .. for me it is the first year when I apply to a GSoc project .. so I don't know how the things are going on .. after this proposal we will have some interviews?  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:17): well I will also read as much as I can about OO  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:17): thanks for your help  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:19): I'm not completly aware of the entire gsoc process. But i doubt there are going to be any interviews(at least not the classic interview)  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:20): ok, thanks  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:22): the main idea is that every canditate talks to the entire community. Also every valuable information or decision must be public to that everyone can benefit from it.  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:23): So it's the community that decides if a candidate is selected and not a single or a small group of interviewers :)  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:24): this is why the best thing for a candidate is to be as active as hi can on the mailing list and on irc  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:24): well that is a really big difference from the classic interviews  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:25): yep :)  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:27): i've noticed that the community is very active  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:27): it is a good thing  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:32): Yes, and it's nice to see it growing.  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:34): Regarding OOo you can also talk with Asiri. He worked with OOo server. No UI, he can still provide valuable info about the way OOo works with documents  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:34): Also he has a better java expertise then me  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:35): ok, i'll try to talk to him  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:35): do you know which is his irc nickname?  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:36): I think it's Asiri. Anyway, you'll notice it when he's online  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:36): ok  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:36): maybe i will find him tomorrow  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:38): He is usually online at earlier hours as he has a +3 or 4h gap from Romania  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:38): where is he from?  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:39): Sri Lanka  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:39): nice  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:40): i will submit my proposal untill tomorrow anyway  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:40): so you can give me a more specific feedback  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:40): and asiri too  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:40): ok, great  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:46): regarding the editing attachment feature  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:47): the application should call getAttachmentData () function to get the content  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:48): and aflter that in the editing process the data are written on the local disc .. and when the user press save button , are sent to the server?  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:49): or this fact should be done automatic in a timer?  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:51): this should be a user triggered event. AutoSave is not a priority  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:51): It will also be problematic because there is no \"draft save\" in XWiki  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:52): we only have mark as \"minor chages\" saving, which is not quite the same thing  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:53): I understand ..  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:57): What you should have, is a 'Save to XWiki' button. So that the user has a clear image of what he is doing.  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 00:58): yes, this way I was thinking too  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:59): Additionally you could have a option of saving to the wiki every time he presses the save button or ctrl+s. This is for users that want speed. But it's not a priority  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 00:59): This also implies that you can catch the save event in OOo  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:03): can you provide me a list of entry points for the add-in, in the next days? And also a basic list of OOo events you can work with?  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:03): ok, sure  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:04): on tuesday it's ok?  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:05): sounds good.  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:05): what do you mean more exactly with \"entry points\"?  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:07): Ways of starting the extension from OOo + it's methods in the extension.  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:08): For example, a classic program has it's entry point set to a public static void main method.   \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:08): Usually in extensions this is something different, and it can be done in multile ways  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:09): \\*multiple  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:09): yes i know what is an entry point for a classical program .. for the oo extensions there is only one way (but I'm not sure about this)  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:10): i will do more research about  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:10): oo has an extension manager which works with addins  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:14): Can we program against this extension manager? So that we enable/disable XOO. Choosing the start moment for XOO will be nice. This could be done at OOo startup or later(at user choice)  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:16): cristinaS, we'll talk more tomorow.  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:16): I can't tell you now .. tomorrow I will read more about it  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:17): ok sure  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:17): http://api.openoffice.org/docs/DevelopersGuide/Extensions/Extensions.xhtml  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:17): this is about extensions  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:17): i'll look into it  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:17): thanks  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:17): I'll be available later in the day. I'm releasing XWord tomorow :)  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:18): ok, bye  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:18): waw :) good luck !  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:18): bye  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 01:18): thank you for your help  \nflorinciu - (30/03/2009 01:19): np, glad i can help  \nxwikibot - (30/03/2009 01:34): XWiki.MartinhoPatricio was modified by XWiki.XWikiGuest (Rollback to version 6.1) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/MartinhoPatricio  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (30/03/2009 09:21): Hai guys good morning.

For example if you search macro, first page (http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/LuceneSearch?text=macro&space=&wikinames=) and 4th (http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/LuceneSearch?text=macro&firstIndex=91) are blank (Results 91 - 120 of 237)  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:01): Hi ilovetomato  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:02): How are you?  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:04): anamariastoica: The Gadgets don't have published code, except in the page itself  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:05): Just visit http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Gadgets/?viewer=code  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:06): You'll notice the line #includeMacros(\"Gadgets.Macros\")  \nanamariastoica - (30/03/2009 17:06): I saw they use just some macros  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:06): This means that the macros are located in the Gadgets.Macros page  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:06): Visit http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Gadgets/Macros?viewer=code  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:07): That's all the source there is  \nanamariastoica - (30/03/2009 17:09): this means it only supports gadgets developed with the gadgets API, and not the ones also using the Open Social API. the former can be included in any web page, compared to the latter which need a container that supports the Open Social API (like iGoogle, orkut, etc)  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:10): That is just a small Proof of Concept  \nanamariastoica - (30/03/2009 17:10): / http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/devguide\\_landing.html  \nanamariastoica - (30/03/2009 17:11): and the macros , like #displaygadget where are they saved ?  \nanamariastoica - (30/03/2009 17:11): i know they are editable through the page, but are they saved like any other normal page edited with wiki syntax ?  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:12): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:12): That is their content  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:12): http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Gadgets/Macros?viewer=code  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:12): That is their definition  \nanamariastoica - (30/03/2009 17:14): then I suppose a iGoogle like dashboard could be a macro as well (and support the drag&drop move of the gadgets on the page)  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:15): Yes  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:35): Hello! Are there any GSoC mentors online right now?  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:36): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:36): Hi tatyana\\_tokareva  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:36): Hi, I would like to discuss my proposal  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:39): Yes, I was interested in a more detailed data model  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:41): ok, which part should I expand? I suppose that generally application construction doesn't require any changes on the platform level, am I right? so, i should focus only on the part connected to classes and data representation.  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:41): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:41): The XClasses and their properties  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:42): Like, is the survey creator needed, or can this information be considered the same as the creator of the document holding the survey?  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:43): And I don't understand this: \"list of classes for questions of different types\"  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:44): I think that XClass for survey should contain information about creator of survey  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:46): Survey should contain questions of different types - multiple choice, true/false, plain text. So, for each of these question types separate class will be used  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:46): K  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:46): I understood that the survey class would contain these classes, which didn't make much sense  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:47): Now it's clearer  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:48): I guess this part of proposal should be modified a bit  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:49): I'm not sure yet which XWiki classes will be used for different properties. Shall I made some research on it and include it in my proposal too?  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:50): Yes, if you can  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:50): If it's not too much  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:51): Hm, that didn't come out nicely...  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:51): I mean, yes, if you want  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:52): yes, of course. I hope that I will have more clear understanding of the whole structure then  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:53): do you have any other comments or suggestions?  \nsdumitriu - (30/03/2009 17:56): For the moment, no  \ntatyana\\_tokareva - (30/03/2009 17:57): ok, thanks! i will make changes in my proposal as soon as i can  \nxwikibot - (30/03/2009 18:13): Community.DevelopmentPractices was modified by xwiki:XWiki.Sergiu (Added the subversion config file we should use) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DevelopmentPractices  \nxwikibot - (30/03/2009 19:22): Features.MySpace was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ChathuraPrabuddha (Added object) - http://workspaces.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/MySpace  \nxwikibot - (30/03/2009 19:23): Features.MySpace was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ChathuraPrabuddha - http://workspaces.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/MySpace  \nxwikibot - (30/03/2009 19:24): Features.MySpace was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ChathuraPrabuddha - http://workspaces.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/MySpace  \nxwikibot - (30/03/2009 19:26): Features.MySpace was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ChathuraPrabuddha - http://workspaces.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/MySpace  \nxwikibot - (30/03/2009 19:32): Features.MySpace was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Rollback to version 3.1) - http://workspaces.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/MySpace  \nxwikibot - (30/03/2009 19:39): Design.ImprovedStatistics was modified by xwiki:XWiki.GuillaumeLerouge - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/ImprovedStatistics  \ncristinaS - (30/03/2009 19:53): florinciu: hi!
