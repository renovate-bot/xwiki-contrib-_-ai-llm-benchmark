I do not reproduce anymore with 5.4.1 in the same exact test case I had before.  \n14:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Denis: no, I don't think so :), but again, I wasn't able to reproduce it before  \n14:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: curious, it does not happen anymore, while I was able to reproduce it all the time  \n14:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0+1  \n14:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: is that expected that the DW does not trigger immediately after creating a new wiki ?  \n14:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I noticed this a few times but I don't know why it happens. Maybe tmortagne knows.  \n14:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0he said exactly the same :)  \n14:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in my case I had to reload the page  \n14:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for me it never get in until I reload, this is not very friendly  \n14:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, I don't see how it could be related to the client side, IMO it must be something on the server side, on the distribution job status  \n14:50\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0do I open an issue ?  \n14:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and the fact that it works after a page reload tells me it's not related to the velocity code. Maybe the job is updated with a delay, after the page is requested.  \n14:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you can report an issue sure  \n15:12\u00a0<Danilo>\u00a0thank you clemens, i could find the documantation now  \n15:14\u00a0<Danilo>\u00a0People, is it possible to pop up a warning windows in Xwiki?

The user can attach an image but when he clicks on it under the attachments tab the browser (Firefox) detects a redirect loop. I've checked the image URL, it looks fine except that it has ?srid=xxxx in the query string. If I remove it I'm redirected back to the the same URL with srid back.  \n18:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I know srid stands for saved request id, do you know/remember any issues/bug that might cause this redirect loop?  \n18:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0afaics there are two places that set the srid on the URL: (1) the csrf token and (2) MyFormAuthenticator.  \n18:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: Was that behind a proxy/load balancer?  \n18:36\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Or a custom authenticator?  \n18:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I need to check, I don't know  \n18:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(will take a while though before I get an answer :) )  \n18:37\u00a0<Sidali\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:37\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The one thing that I can think of is IP-locked cookies  \n18:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0One request fails to authenticate, and redirects to /login/, but this one properly authenticates and redirects back to /download/, which gets in a loop  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Or something like that  \n18:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed  \n18:38\u00a0<Sidali>\u00a0has quit  \n18:38\u00a0<Sidali\\_>\u00a0is now known as <Sidali>  \n18:38\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0httpheaders is a better extension for debugging that  \n18:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, thanks Sergiu  \n18:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Firebug doesn't show redirects that well  \n18:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/  \n18:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I haven't use it but I'll give it a try  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys please check http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/DownloadFormFeedback  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've updated it with latest feedback  \n19:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:17\u00a0<nickless>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:29\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:44\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:58\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:59\u00a0<nickless>\u00a0has quit  \n22:31\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:52\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:46\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit\n"}
