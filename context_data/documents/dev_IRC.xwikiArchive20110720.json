These will allow you to make macro calls in velocity script.  \n14:34\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0how does one usually include velocity scripts one finds into the wiki  \n14:34\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0For XWiki macros, you can create a document containing an XWikiMacro object, then anywhere in the wiki you can call {{yourMacro param1=value1 param2=value2 /}}  \n14:34\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think XWiki macros are the ones you are thinking of if you have a MediaWiki background.  \n14:35\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0lets take an example, to clarify  \n14:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:35\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i happen to look at a Livetable Generator extension  \n14:35\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0in another window  \n14:36\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0its quite elaborate code, probably velocity code  \n14:36\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0as an admin, would i copy and paste this into some page or even space, set aside for macros  \n14:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0if it's called with #yourMacro() then its velocity  \n14:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you're trying to write complex script then you want velocity macros, if you want to make it easy for users to add foratted content like in MediaWiki, you want XWikiMacros  \n14:38\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0its not documented ,what the call convention is: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Livetable+Generator#HDescription  \n14:38\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0ok  \n14:38\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0right now i only want to use macros, preferrably those that help to format contents, but also collect some information such as child pages  \n14:38\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0(if those exist)  \n14:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Velocity macros only work inside of velocity scripts though  \n14:40\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i guess i really need to learn the vocabulary first  \n14:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So if you want to display something, it's easiest to develop an XWiki macro, then you can use {{myMacro param=val/}}  \n14:40\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0probably am not using it correctly  \n14:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you are using velocity macros, then you need to put them in a velocity script like this:  \n14:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0{{velocity}}#myMacro(param, param, param){{/velocity}}  \n14:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0^note that the {{velocity}} is itself an xwiki macro invocation.  \n14:42\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i guess as a newcomer i am first interested in undestanding how to make use of extensions included in the xwiki extensions \"directory\"  \n14:42\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0when you browser those extensions that you notice that some are, what you called xwiki macros, while others elaborate velocity code  \n14:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Each one is different, they are contributed by users who just needed a certain feature and write it.  \n14:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*wrote it  \n14:43\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0right, so as a user/admin, my first task would be to know how to make use of them  \n14:43\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0how are they \"imported\" into a xwiki  \n14:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think the best thing to do is read a few of them just to get a handle on how scripting works.  \n14:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If they are \"snippets\" then you can just paste them into a wiki page, applications can be imported using the import function.  \n14:44\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i will surely do that, but as a first step, i only want to know how to use them as a black box  \n14:45\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0right. i think anything that is more than 2-3 lines of code would probably be best imported  \n14:45\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0otherwise there is a lot of repetition  \n14:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Keep in mind that since some of them are old and the API does change, they may not all work without modifications, some may not work at all anymore (I think we weeded most of those out though)  \n14:45\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0where is the import function located/accessed  \n14:46\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0ok, thats good to know.  \n14:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Oh, you can paste it into one page then include that page where you want to use it.  \n14:46\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0how does one include a page  \n14:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0We have a built in {{include}} macro.  \n14:47\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0something like {{include page=pagename}} \u00a0?  \n14:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Include+Macro  \n14:47\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0jup thats gret  \n14:47\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0great  \n14:47\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0how do you import macros?  \n14:47\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0or rather scripts  \n14:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you have an application (this is a .xar file) you import it through the administrtion interface, as admin, upper left dropdown menu, \"Administor Wiki\"  \n14:48\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0.xar sounds like compiled code, or is it just plain script text  \n14:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's the export/import format. It's zipped xml files, you can look inside of one by unzipping it.  \n14:50\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0perhaps i can ask you another question  \n14:51\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0how can i create a hierarchy of pages  \n14:51\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0within a space  \n14:51\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0can this be done?  \n14:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Each page has a \"parent\" field.  \n14:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0This is pertty flexable, the parent of a page can actually be in a different space.  \n14:52\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:52\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0ok, say, i just created a new page in a space  \n14:52\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0or rather a new space with a top level page called scripts  \n14:53\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0what do i do to create a child page called livetable  \n14:53\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0so that the child is in the same space  \n14:54\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i can see the add page menu item, but i think it adds a page \"globally\" and not as a child of the current viewed page  \n14:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0When you're editing a page, there's a little icon right above where it says \"Title:\" (upper left, just above where you type)  \n14:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it allows you to edit the parent of that page  \n15:00\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0sorry had to leave a moment  \n15:01\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0ok great.  \n15:01\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0interesting the parent is Scripts.WebHome  \n15:01\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0what is webhome  \n15:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0WebHome is the default page when creating a space.  \n15:02\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0to bad it doesnt allow to browser the page names there and just select a parent  \n15:03\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0so the sequence is reversed  \n15:04\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0first the leaf page dot then the parent  \n15:13\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0thanks cjdelisle  \n15:13\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0xwiki sounds very promising, in partular the ad-hoc extensibility of objects and classes  \n15:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0cool  \n15:16\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0is there a link i can read more about xwiki macros and the velocity languag  \n15:17\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i noticed the apache project pages for the velocity engine but this doesnt include any language docs, as least i havent seen them yet  \n15:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0back from my daily dshell failure  \n15:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting <-- this is a good starting point for looking into scripting  \n15:31\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0thanks, i just noticed something strange, perhaps you have some idea  \n15:31\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i have a document with 4 annotations  \n15:32\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i attached the document to a parent  \n15:32\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0a new parent  \n15:32\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0in the same space  \n15:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html  \n15:34\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0now there is an inconsistency -- the document shows 4 annotations, but at the bottom of the page it shows 0 annotations  \n15:34\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0also trying to view the annotations doesnt work  \n15:34\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0is this a known problem  \n15:34\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0is there a way to get the annotations back  \n15:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I really don't know anything about annotations. I think they are still there because they are simply objects added to the document, beyond that i can't be of much help.  \n15:35\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0ok  \n15:37\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0strange, the objects, while they show the selection of text that were annotated, dont have any information where the annotations are actually located in the text  \n15:51\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i guess the standalone install is not using mysql  \n15:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0correct, default is HSQL  \n15:51\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0is there a way to view the database  \n15:52\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i think something is probably corrupted there  \n15:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not sure how to connect to HSQL.  \n15:53\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i guess its also possible to run xwiki with mysql  \n15:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But you won't find much useful, the db is very normalized so looking around in it manually is \u00a0D:  \n15:53\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i see,  \n15:53\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0just many many tuples with lots of indexes  \n15:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation  \n15:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/DatabaseSchema <-- in case you're curious  \n15:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: it's easy to connect to a hsqldb  \n15:55\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0thats interesting  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/blob/master/xwiki-enterprise-database/xwiki-enterprise-database-hsqldb/pom.xml  \n15:55\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0do extensions add tables or are they all using tables already exising  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: look at the bottom  \n15:57\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0ok, i think i will redo the installation with mysql  \n15:58\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0annotation is the main feature i need right now, and i would add a few hundred annotations, so i dont want to loose them  \n15:58\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0or at least know how to restore them  \n15:58\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0if they get lost  \n15:59\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0using mysql i have at least the usual GUI tools to review and if necessary repair the db  \n16:00\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0also, i have used confluence wiki so far and got quite used to its excellent UI; its very well thought out  \n16:00\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0perhaps i can somewhere make some UI improvement suggestions to make xwiki even better  \n16:00\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0perhaps in the future i could even code them myself  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would be great!  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to make suggestions\u2026 and even better to contribute indeed ;))  \n16:01\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0it would be a learning curve and i have little time, but it would be interesting  \n16:01\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i guess its mainly java programming ,,,  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure, you'll get support from us on the list and here  \n16:07\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0thanks  \n16:07\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0ok, need to go ... thank you for all the help  \n16:08\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0btw, was gliffy integrated into xwiki  \n16:08\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0i noticed a discussion about it about a year or two ago  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not yet  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd love to see that too  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nobody is working on it ATM AFAIK  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(dan18)  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it looks easy enough to do)  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's balsamiq mockup integration though (although it's not the same domain)  \n16:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0is it in principle supported from the gliffy side?  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n16:22\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:45\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0is now known as <evalica>  \n16:48\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n17:05\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0sorry, was away  \n17:12\u00a0<dan18>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: why does Blog.Categories page have an object of type Blog.CategoryClass ? Is it used?  \n17:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes...  \n17:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's the root category  \n17:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see  \n17:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't remember exactly why it was needed  \n17:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But without it there's a problem with displaying categories  \n17:18\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n17:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the \"issue\" I have (and I need to find a solution for it) is that Blog.Category \"inherits\" a sheet from Blog.CategoryClass but doesn't want it because the content of Blog.Categories outputs a different thing, i.e. the category management UI.  \n17:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so either (1) I display the (rendered) content of Blog.Categories first and then the Blog.CategorySheet or (2) add a way to \"block\" an inherited sheet  \n17:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Why does it inherit it?  \n17:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Didn't you say that if a document contains an explicit sheet object, it uses that?  \n17:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0because Blog.CategoryClass is binded to Blog.CategorySheet  \n17:28\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but the issue in this case is that Blog.Categories doesn't use a custom (external) sheet, the \"sheet\" is its own code  \n17:28\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so I need to take this into account in my desing  \n17:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. If I use a SheeInclude object that points to the host page I get infinite recursion.  \n17:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I need to handle this.  \n17:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm  \n17:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0wait  \n17:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't get infinite recursion, but the Blog.Categories content is duplicated, must be a bug in my code, checking..  \n17:49\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:29\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Does anyone know if there is supposed to be a document: XWiki.WatchListClass ?  \n20:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n20:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm, I don't see it created on init and it's not in the default xar.  \n20:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh nvm  \n21:22\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:40\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0hello  \n21:40\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0I encountered a bug in the annotation functionality  \n21:41\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0and am inverstigating a bit the bug by browsing the database  \n21:41\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:41\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0is there someone i can ask or email about my investigation of this bug  \n21:42\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0much depends on how the annotation determines how many annotations are included in a document  \n21:42\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i think  \n21:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you would report it on jira.xwiki.org that would be great.  \n21:46\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0hi cjdelisle  \n21:46\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0in the meantime i switched to mysql  \n21:47\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0(there as a little hickup after the switch, that the mysql database was not initially populated, causing credential information to be missing ...  \n21:47\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0... so no Admin user was defined  \n21:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i think thats sort of a bug also  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Admin is not in the database until you import the default pages.  \n21:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's outlined here: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation  \n21:49\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok, thanks, i missed that  \n21:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:49\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0in the end i found a suggestion to export the HSQL db and then import it  \n21:50\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0which is actually great, since i could then look at the bug  \n21:50\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0within mysql  \n21:53\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:53\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i need a bit terminology help to describe the issue  \n21:54\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0How do you call the items in a page on the top right: Comments (0) Annotations (5) Attachments (0) ...  \n21:55\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0just below the page title  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0shortcuts?  \n21:55\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0and then the same line appears at the very bottom  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know if we have a name for them  \n21:55\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0where they actual comments/annotations etc. are listed  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at the bottom they're called doc tabs or doc extra tabs  \n21:56\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok  \n21:56\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0the problem that i see is that the info in the doc extra tabs and in the line above is inconsistent  \n21:56\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0above it says 5 annotations, below it says 0 annotations  \n21:57\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0and indeed annotations can not be viewed  \n21:57\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0or seen marked up in the text  \n21:57\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0when selecting show annotations  \n21:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems like you have something wrong somewhere  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could check if there are annotation objects  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0edit the page in the object editor  \n21:58\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0actually i checked  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you'll be able to check that  \n21:58\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0and they are all there  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then that's very strange that the annotation tab at the bottom doesn't show them  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not aware of any bug in this area  \n21:58\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0just they dont appear at the bottom of the document, nor marked up in the text  \n21:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's their state?  \n21:59\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i played a bit with DDNS today, perhaps i can show it to you  \n21:59\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0what is \"state\"  \n21:59\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0where can i see it  \n21:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in object mode you should be able to see their state  \n21:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex if you changed too much the text they can be dangling  \n21:59\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0when i select \"object\"  \n22:00\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0edit object, thats called object mode?  \n22:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n22:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n22:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0dangling ones should be shown at the bottom too  \n22:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Annotations+Application  \n22:00\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0well, i can see the list of objects  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Annotations+Application#HDeleteannotatedtext  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah one thing  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you click on the annotation menu entry, it opens a box  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you have a \"show annotation\" check box  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it checked?  \n22:01\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0right,  \n22:02\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0yes, thats part of the problem, even when its checked, they dont show in the text  \n22:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very strange, I don't understand how this could happen  \n22:02\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0so its neither in the text, with show annotations checked, nor at the bottom listed, although the objects are defined,  \n22:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you could do is export the page as a XAR and send it to us  \n22:02\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i may be wrong but it may have to do with changing the parent  \n22:03\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0after i changed the parent, i noticed the problem  \n22:03\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0but perhaps the problem already occurred before without me noticing it  \n22:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm can you reproduce that on another page?  \n22:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(changing the parent))  \n22:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(on an annotated page)  \n22:04\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0good idea  \n22:04\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0although i now switched database, so at least this is not equal anymore  \n22:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise just export the page and upload it somewhere so that I can download it  \n22:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what version of XE are you using?  \n22:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(unfortunately our annotation expert is not online right now but I can provide some first level support ;))  \n22:06\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0this i can do, since i have an export  \n22:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if we don't success in solving your issue now you could send an email to the users list and our annotation expert will see it tomorrow)  \n22:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can just export that single page  \n22:08\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok,  \n22:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:13\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:14\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0the document includes an abstract of an unpublished paper which was given to me  \n22:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Dan18: should I download the xar you pointed me to or is it working now?  \n22:18\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0its not working, so if you could forward the xar to the right person that would be really great  \n22:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing now on my machine  \n22:18\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0btw, i erred a bit in the description of the problem,  \n22:19\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0that there are 5 annotations is displayed in both locations, on the top right and at the bottom  \n22:19\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0but, nevertheless, the annotations dont show up neither in the text nor at the bottom  \n22:20\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0in fact, as you may see, at the bottom there is a text \"No annotations for this document\"  \n22:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I can reproduce  \n22:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see the bottom tab mentioning 5 annotations but they're not displayed  \n22:20\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0that was fast  \n22:21\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0as said, i want to markup several documents, which could potentially yield a few hundred annotations, but i am really reluctant to do that if they might disappear  \n22:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n22:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've never seen this error  \n22:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but since I can reproduce it it's going to be easy to debug  \n22:21\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0btw, i added a property to the annotation class  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I can see that  \n22:22\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0if its relevant  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"softgoal\"  \n22:22\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0right  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've removed it locally  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the problem is still there  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm there's an empty annotation  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0removing it  \n22:22\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0its quite amazing the flexiblity to add properties  \n22:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not helping...  \n22:22\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0yes, that was a test annotation, i tried to add one more  \n22:22\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0to see if it would show up  \n22:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw this issue has nothing to do with the database  \n22:23\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0i added it n the object view  \n22:23\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0mode  \n22:23\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0ok  \n22:23\u00a0<Dan18>\u00a0hmm, i am think, what would happen if i add another annotation in \"text\" mode, if the other ones would show up  \n22:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll follow up with the developer of the annotation subsystem tomorrow  \n22:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw what version of XE are you using?
