Would you know by any chance how to do a XWQL query with a where on a static list field?  \n17:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Nope, sorry  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k, I'll try to dig more, found \"member of\" but can't seem to sue that properly  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah found an example on http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWQL/WebHome, trying  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't seem to work, I get a npe  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found the solution  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it works if I set \"relational storage\" on the static list field....  \n17:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ah, yes  \n17:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Always do that  \n17:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since a multiselect without relational storage is just a large piece of text  \n17:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And doing LIKE queries is very bad for performance  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok\u2026  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I have a strange behavior\u2026 I have this query: \"select distinct committer.id, committer.aliases, committer.avatar, committer.name from Document doc, doc.object(GitHubCode.CommitterClass) as committer\". committer.aliases is a static list and this query only returns entries for committers who have aliases set...  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any idea?  \n20:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0strangely if I remove 'relational storage' from that field it works fine  \n20:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:24\u00a0<CIA-120>\u00a0Jerome Velociter\u000f ldap-ui\u000f \\* r6ebdf6c\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/6ebdf6cf1d3fb15f7b9d5e22001b6fa7ac21dc63 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-ldap/xwiki-platform-ldap-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/AdminLdapSheet.xml :\u000f XWIKI-2551 Create a LDAP administration app - http://git.io/fBQH3w  \n21:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Please use a different color, I can't stand that pink  \n21:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: what pink?

 \n21:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought we took a lot of care not to loose anything  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but I was surprised to see ludovic only with 200 or so commits)  \n21:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Starts with:  \n21:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0XWIKI-1393: SVN reorganization to take into account the different XWiki products  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's only the stats from the move to git?  \n21:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Which was r3655 in svn  \n21:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are guys like roverwolf mentioned  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or sgaide  \n21:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they were very old committers  \n21:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ah, no, I was looking in the wrong place (enterprise)  \n21:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually it does start at:  \n21:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0New repository initialized by cvs2svn.  \n21:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0https://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/trunk@1  \n21:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So nothing was lost actually  \n21:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey that's cool :)  \n21:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's just that the full history is not accessible from the master branch  \n21:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Those early commits are reachable from the old tags  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n21:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Author: (no author) <(no author)@xwiki.com>  \n21:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So (no author) is actually cvs2svn  \n21:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0XWiki CI was me, I did some commits from agent1 without using the right .gitconfig  \n21:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0fm should be Fabio  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah indeed, I'll add this alias for him  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(done locally)  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0next step is to install 3.5 on xwiki.org, then I can install the GitHub app there  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'll wait for 3.5 final to be released before upgrading)  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this committers macro is working quite well :)  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the time you run it takes a long time though since it does the git clones)  \n22:00\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0sdumitriu: around ?  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: fyi http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/GitHub+Application/committers-xwiki-20120219.png  \n22:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0sburjan`: Yes  \n22:02\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: wow 17 :)  \n22:02\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0almost proud of myself  \n22:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n22:04\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0sdumitriu: I am still curious about the \"Expires\" field in http response  \n22:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's normal so that browsers don't cache the HTML of a page  \n22:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since it's a wiki, it's supposed to change often  \n22:05\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0ok, makes sense  \n22:05\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0but is it set manually to add that date ?  \n22:05\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0because we also have \"Cache-Control no-cache\" which does the same trick afaik  \n22:06\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: so the ones who have an x are not actual committers ?  \n22:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they may have been in the past but they're not current committers  \n22:07\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I see  \n22:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go, bfn  \n22:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:15\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:54\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
