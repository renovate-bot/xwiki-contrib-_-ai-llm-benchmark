 \n10:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0happy releaseday :)  \n10:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0mails send via \"share page\" \u00a0and \"invitations\" are send by normal users via Programming rights ?  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: good question  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: we could have a send mail right like we introduced create wiki right  \n10:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Invitations might as well be PR because it needs PR to let someone into a closed wiki  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: what we need to fix is in the context of a public farm like xwiki.org  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0public open farm  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where everyone can register  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus spam the entire planet  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: indeed but we would need a UI  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our UI is not generic ATM  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(rights UI\u00b0  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0)  \n10:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, I tentatively agree with the \"admins only\", just trying to find use cases that would break if only admins can send mail  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still I guess even without UI at least we can document how to do it using XObjects in the meantime  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: we can start by introducing a send mail right which inherit admin right and base the code on send mail right so that it's ready when improving the UI  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the question is more: do we need a finer grained right than what we have now  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i.e. admin right for ex  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this won't solve the send page by mail potential issue  \n10:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it depends on the use case IMO and that's why we need a special right I think  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we need to decide who we want to be able to do that  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ideally everyone  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually that's a nice spam system :)  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you create a new page with some page  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then you email it with the send page by email feature to lots of people  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/some page/some spam  \n10:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0there are zillions of websites which let you do that  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does \"share by email\" support specifying several emails?  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it doesn't mention it in the UI)  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it just says \"XWiki user or email address\"  \n10:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0answer: yes  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it supports more than 1 recipient  \n10:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you're saying this is a false problem and it's ok?  \n10:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nah, we should consider spam but we should not call it critical  \n10:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0bb in a few  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either gdelhumeau didn't do it right or we cannot contribute a new right cleanly  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see the create wiki right is in the security module itself  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the Right class itself  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: ?  \n10:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it was probably seen as standard enough to be put directly in security module  \n10:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but AFAIK it's very easy to add a right  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: good morning, you're working on the template support for the new mail module today right? any ETA?  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: nothing is standard, multiwiki support is supposed to be all in the platform-wiki modules  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ideally)  \n10:44\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but ok if it's easy good  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can try it  \n10:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: concept of multiwiki is everywhere, you have it in the modle module etc  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but we're moving everything in the platform-wiki module  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not something the platform-wiki module can do alone  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no we are not  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we moved quite a lot already to there  \n10:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we are not going to move WikiReference in there for example  \n10:45\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0@Vincent : Good morning I'm on customer project for the morning  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: that's an interesting discussion, to decide what the boundaries are  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway adding a new right is just calling AuthorizationManager#register AFAIK  \n10:46\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: right can be registered anytime and multiple times, however we have an known issue with implied right  \n10:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the way those are current setup should be reversed  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: +1  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: can I contribute a new right in another module?  \n10:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yes, unless you that right to be implied by a right not in that module  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok good I dont think that's my case here  \n10:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0s/you/you need  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the other way around AFAIU  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: in the meantime from what I seen in the code you can override a standard right using register too  \n10:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: no so sure  \n10:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: I think so, but I have never check it  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: if you want that Admin imply SendMail then you can't officially since that's Admin who indicate that right now  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I'd ike is Admin Right implies sendMail right  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see  \n10:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you cannot currently  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too bad  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it should be done the other way since it does not make much sense  \n10:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I know  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you can re-register admin right  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(even if not very clean on the long run)  \n10:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0it should be change, and it will be an API breakage, for sure  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either brekage or create a new Right class  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: could be a new interface that extends RightDescription  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and support both)  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that would not break anything  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then Right implement the new interface  \n10:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0adding a new method in Right does not break anything since it's a class and not an interface  \n10:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: you should be careful while redefining however, since this redefinition feature is there mainly to avoid issue when you install/uninstall/reinstall an extension  \n10:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: as I said it's not clean and it's only in the meantime  \n10:52\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I have look at it carefully enough to confirm the breakage or not  \n10:53\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0s/I have/I have not  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from API point of view it's ok at least, then in the implementation of course it was be a bit more complex but it could probably be done since it's hidden  \n10:53\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0What I know is that the ability to redefine a right was not their to change its definition  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we should not try to redefine a standard right anyway, even if it works  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's like overwriting a template, it's a pain for upgrades and it can create a real mess when it's done by an extension  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: ok I'll start it then  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: do you already have code for the template feature?  \n10:59\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0yes i start coding it  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: best would be that you clone xwiki-platform in your github account  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then commit in your repo  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that you can then do PR  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and so that I can check the code there too  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n11:01\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0ok  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: ping me when you have some code ready for me to look at, I'd like to get moving on this as we need to finish and be iso-feature real fast now  \n11:07\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0ok  \n11:57\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: what is the progress status of your evalution of teamcity ?  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still needs tuning  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to make all our builds pass  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0interesting features though  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've not been active on it for months now  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you want to take over?  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the instance is accessible  \n11:59\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and regarding the license, do we got one ?  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://teamcity.xwiki.org/  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTM we are allowed to have 3 agents AFAIK  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm wait  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok now we have unliimted agents  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I just forgot to install the license ;)  \n12:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:41\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0hello, I restarted a xwiki 6.0.1 instance tomcat7 and now all search give me 0 result, any idea how I can debug this? (search worked before the tomcat restart)  \n15:26\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n15:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Slashman: \u00a0seems the \u00a0environment.permanentDirectory derined in WEB-INF/xwiki.properties has chnage so that solr does not find its index (maybe).  \n15:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that should be logged in the xwiki.lon on startup (\" .... New index directory detected: old=null new=/path/to/index\")  \n15:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: you migrated xwiki.properties and xwiki.cfg ?  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(or any other modification in the WAR files)  \n16:03\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0ClemensR, tmortagne : I didn't do anything, but I solved the issue by emptying the following folders: \"/var/lib/xwiki/data/lucene\" and \"/var/lib/xwiki/data/solr/xwiki/data\" and then force a reindex  \n16:07\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n16:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, there is an extra \"xwiki\" in \"/var/lib/xwiki/data/solr/xwiki/data\" compated to an 5.4.4 instance, seems this has changed in between  \n16:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and in that case a reindex is in order, yes  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0/var/lib/xwiki/data/solr/xwiki/data path does not make much sense  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wrong copy/paste ?  \n16:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0in my jetty-hsql developer install it is under data/solr/xwiki/data/ \u00a0instead of data/solr/data/ (for 5.4.4), too  \n16:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so it seems somehow an extra \"/xwiki\" slipped in  \n16:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm looks like a bug  \n16:40\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0hello dear xwiki community! i have a question, how can i manipulate, edit a content from a document that were created via a template via \u00a0java-api?  \n16:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there is nothing special about a document created from a template compared to any other document (I think), so this should be possible  \n16:45\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0well, how so? even if i want to edit that document via xwiki it is not possible via the wiki editor neither wysiwyg editor, which means that the document content is saved as objects  \n16:45\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0so that is special right?  \n16:46\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:47\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0so the content filled in from the user in the formular (inline editor) is saved ro that object property? field? and than attached to the document object...  \n16:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess I misunderstood the use case  \n16:49\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0my code is manipulating the content from pages coming in via events, that works fine, thanks to your help and documentation, but it is not working with pages created via template ....  \n16:49\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0no problem  \n16:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0inline editing happens as soon as the document has a sheet, and it should inherit this from its template (if the template has one)  \n16:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, so you have an event listener taking care of the content  \n16:51\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0that's fine, it's the way it should be  \n16:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and the event listener is not invoked when a page is created from a template?  \n16:51\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i just need a way to do that via java  \n16:52\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0when i get the \"special\" document the document.getContent() is empty  \n16:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, and the template does have content?  \n16:55\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0^^ yes of course, but i don't know how to access it and manipulate it, because its beeing handle other way  \n16:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I just trying to be able to reproduce it step by step ..  \n16:56\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0no problem  \n16:56\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i am glad you are helping me go through it  \n16:59\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0normal case: onEvent(Event event, Object source, Object data) -> document = (XWikiDocument) source -> xdom = document.getXDOM() -> getChildrenByType(xdom, TableRowBlock.class, true)) (and from here on i start editing the document)  \n17:00\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0but when fetching data from the document created via template that is not possible...  \n17:02\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0brb in 20min.  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vfzevaze: I doubt it has much to do with the fact that the document is created from template, not all document have content in the XWikiDocument#getContent() way, some documents have content stored in objects and have empty content (created from template or not)  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for those you usually need to know the objects to know what is the main content (if any)  \n17:06\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0vfzevaze: I think you want to set the \"Action on create\" \u00a0on \"Save and Edit\" \u00a0instead of \"Edit\" \u00a0in the Template Provider  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it depend on what you edit content basically  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it does not matter in case of documents like that  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/what/why/  \n17:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0usually wiki content stored in an object is stored in a TextAreaClass property and you can check if it's wiki content using TextAreaClass#isWikiContent()  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically you get all document's object xclasses, for each one you look at TextAreaClass properties and if it's a wiki content you can user rendering API to parse the content do you transformation and then put the new content  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but usually those document has quite strict format and you might break some things by doing it  \n17:14\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:26\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0ok, got the content: document.getXObjects().entrySet().iterator()  \n17:26\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0but how to get the xdom object? or how to manipulate that content?  \n17:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0using rendering API (that's what XWikiDocument#getXDOM does), see http://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome  \n17:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can also look at XWikiDocument#getXDOM sources I guess  \n17:27\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0sure  \n17:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and XWikiDocument#setContent(XDOM content))  \n17:32\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0XWikiDocument#getXDOM is in this case empty  \n17:32\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0somehow i have to get it through the xobjects  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vfzevaze: I'm talking about the Java source of XWikiDocument#getXDOM  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what you need to do with the object proerty is what XWikiDocument#getXDOM do with the document content  \n17:36\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0ok  \n17:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I tried to reproduce the issue but failed .... setting SandBox.TestPage1 as the template, however ...  \n17:37\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0oh just to parse it...  \n17:37\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0ok  \n17:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the XDOM is not empty initially  \n17:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0over here  \n17:37\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0because the content of the page is not empty...  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: from what I understood vfzevaze is talking about (not very rare) use case where everything is in the object  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example pages in extesions.xwiki.org don't have any content  \n17:38\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0http://i.imgur.com/gD55lLU.png  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*extensions.xwiki.org  \n17:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, I understood \u00a0that vfzevaze checked that the template contains wiki content ...  \n17:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0... maybe I misunderstand  \n17:39\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0http://i.imgur.com/plDFTsV.png  \n17:39\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n17:42\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0and here you can see that the content is in the field / property http://i.imgur.com/Fxt7SfV.png  \n17:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, and this O2 is the template?  \n17:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0or a page created from the template ?  \n17:43\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0at the beginning it thought thats the way to get it, throught document.getContent(), but it is correct empry  \n17:43\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0\\*empty  \n17:43\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a002 is the page created via the template yes  \n17:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if the stuff is all in XObjects which have a sheet, then it is ok that the document.getContent() is empty  \n17:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0now trying to see why the wiki editor comes up an creating the page  \n17:47\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, I get the inline (forms) editor on the spot when creating the \u00a0page from the template ... so I misunderstoor the issue a third time or so :)  \n17:49\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0when iterating the xobjects that how far i got untill now: http://i.imgur.com/LDXcxzp.png  \n17:49\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0that's when i decided to ask, because it's getting too ugly  \n17:50\u00a0<vfzevaze1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0comparing entity reference by their toString is pretty dangerous  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0toString here is not an API  \n17:51\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0right? i now, it was just for debugging  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so what do you want to know exactly ?  \n17:51\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0\\*know  \n17:52\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i want to know if there is a best practice to do that  \n17:52\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0not having to parse the content again  \n17:52\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0acessing the ceratin field and than editing it  \n17:52\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0that's it  \n17:52\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i want to edit that one table  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you already know the class and want the objects of that class ?  \n17:53\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0yes  \n17:53\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0but as xdom  \n17:53\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0or similar already parsed...  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no API returning you directly the XDOM of an object field  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is only String in there  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you will have to parse it yourself (that it just use rendering parser API)  \n17:54\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0and how can i edit that field then? editing the string and setting the field?  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as I said look at XWikiDocument#getXDOM and XWikiDocument#setContent(XDOM)  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's exactly what you are supposed to do basically but with the object field content instead of document content  \n17:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you really really don't want to use the rendering API you can create a XWikiDocument set the field content as content and user getXDOM/setContent and then getContent  \n17:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(I mean a temporary XWikiDocument java instance, no need to save it)  \n17:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's pretty ugly from design point of view but it will be the same code  \n18:01\u00a0<vfzevaze1>\u00a0thank you  \n18:04\u00a0<vfzevaze1>\u00a0i will write a howto for this, maybe it helps someone  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vfzevaze1: that's a good idea :)  \n18:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<vfzevaze1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:36\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<vfzevaze1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:49\u00a0<vfzevaze1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:43\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n20:59\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:25\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:48\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:19\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n22:24\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:30\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n23:35\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:49\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit\n"}
