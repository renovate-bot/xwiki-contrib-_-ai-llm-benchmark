After that is done and the master branch is free for the 7.x cycle, we can start committing improvements and such.  \n10:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so this means that in 1-2 days we could apply your PR  \n10:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0hope that`s ok with you  \n10:50\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0k.

I don't commit anymore  \n12:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sorry for that  \n12:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0now I'm going to write a test for that  \n13:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n13:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but I'll commit it after the release  \n13:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I do not understand what I might have broken in the stable-6.3 branch in http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform-6.3.x/72/ \u00a0... but before I retrigger jenkins to see if it just a flicker I better wait till the 6.4-rc1 is out - I guess the build agents are better kept busy with the master builds yet ...  \n13:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ClemensR: that is know problems. the package module fails sometimes. It will pass if we trigger a full rebuild of the platform. But let's leave this for after 6.4RC1  \n13:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0mflorea: ah, thanks, good to know. I was worried I might have introduces some bug  \n13:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0anyone knows if Victor is working on \u00a0ADMINTOOL-1 issue? I got some users over here which got bitten by that bug and would like to see a fix ... so I would like to fix it, but I don't want to create double work  \n13:39\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:42\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n13:45\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n13:46\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:47\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:47\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0is now known as <Enygma`>  \n13:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: I doubt Victor is working on it  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0he assigned himself more than 1 year ago  \n13:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, I guess I can just reassign to myself and see what happens ;)  \n13:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ClemensR: asked Victor.
