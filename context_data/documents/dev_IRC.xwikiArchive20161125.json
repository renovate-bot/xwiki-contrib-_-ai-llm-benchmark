(the username I use is correct)  \n11:34\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0and it seems something is transfered but I don't know much more than that  \n11:36\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I'm using curl -u xx:yy -X PUT --data-binary \"@pagexwiki.xml\" -H \"Content-Type: application/xml\" https://domain.ltd/rest/wikis/main/spaces/Main/pages/test2  \n11:36\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, do you have an experience about that ?  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0robi\\_: it's supposed to work exactly the same  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: I don't have much experience with curl but looks good especially if you get a proper answer  \n11:40\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, I don't get the documented answer  \n11:40\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I get a transfer status, nothing more  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: do you have access to server log ?  \n11:40\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, yes !  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe there is some error there  \n11:40\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ok let's see  \n11:41\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0absolutely nothing :(  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what http code do you get in the response ?  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you sure the wiki in right in your URL ?  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just on case: the id of the main wiki is \"xwiki\", not main  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/on case/in case/  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the URL you gave means the following document reference: \"main:Main.test2\"  \n11:48\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, same thing with rest/wikis/xwiki/spaces/Main/pages/test2 (replaced main by xwiki). I got no http code, only a transfer status with rates etc  \n11:48\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0strange  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure I understand what you means exactly by transfer status, either you get an HTTP response or you get nothing  \n11:49\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, I mean this http://pastebin.com/qvKt3mQX  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least if it reaches XWiki it will send you back a HTTP response whatever happen  \n11:50\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I fully agree  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sorry I have no idea what http://pastebin.com/qvKt3mQX means, what produces this report ? curl ?  \n11:51\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0yes curl  \n11:51\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ok I'll investigate. Thanks for your help tmortagne ;)  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe you do get an HTTP response but you need to tell curl to display it  \n11:52\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, I'm just using the exact syntax used in xwiki documentation  \n11:52\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I'll investigate  \n12:02\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, there was two issues: the wiki name and a username issue in my latest tests  \n12:03\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0thanks again  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok, glad you found it  \n12:18\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n12:24\u00a0<tom\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n12:48\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0what else would i need for the guy next to the authenticator, jldap and ldap-api?  \n12:50\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0somehow my config for mapping user attributes dont work anymore.. debug says not much, i can login with the user etc but somehow first and last name wont get imported into the xwiki... i wanna try it with the gui now  \n13:32\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0robi\\_: \u00a0maybe, check xwiki.authentication.ldap.update\\_user=1 in xwiki.cfg and your user attributes in ldap (ie cn/uid/... renamed) and I noticed in 8.4 that I must modify a user property to test user updating  \n14:51\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0regarding my ldap problem... i get the debug logs (Invalid DN Syntax) .. i used DOMAIN\\{0} in the gui for binding to the ldap server, which worked.. but after that it says \"can't find any attributes for user [DOMAIN\\user] and it creates a local user which the information i typed in (user & password).... the strange thing is, that it finds all my group mapping and the users that are in this group which should get mapped to it  \n14:52\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0so i think there is a problem finding the account somehow even tho i can bind to the ldap  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0robi\\_: might be a regression actually but I'm surprised nobody reported it, the issue if that the authenticator expect the bind DN to be a proper DN which DOMAIN\\user is not  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess AD accept its special non standard form for bind but not for search  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0let me try something  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0robi\\_: just release a 9.1.1 version that should fix LDAP-38, you get get it on http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/Authenticator/  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tell me if it's better  \n16:20\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0it works thx :)  \n17:09\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0but not everything.. group mapping still doesnt work ... i tried with few users now.  \n17:09\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0the way i use it now is .. i use a static user to authenticate to the AD .. it works fine like thtat  \n17:10\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0\\*that  \n17:37\u00a0<robi\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_5>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n23:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
