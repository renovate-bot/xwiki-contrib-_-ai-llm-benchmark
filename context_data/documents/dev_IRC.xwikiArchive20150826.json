 \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I look at the examples at http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/ZIP+Explorer+Plugin they would all work  \n11:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I nice trick is to do \u00a0\u00a0require([\"$xwiki.getAttachmentURL('...')/lib/whatever.js\"], function (x) { ...  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not a nice trice  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trick :)  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's an ungly hack  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0its much better to do $xwiki.zipexplorer.getLink(...)  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*getFileLink()  \n11:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Well it's easier to remember 1 API function than 2 so I know there's tons of that stuff  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's exactly the same as for webjars  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could try to make the URL yourself  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you're doomed if you do  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why we provide $services.webjrs.url(...)  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that allows us to change the impl  \n11:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but at any rate, after /lib/whatever.js executes, it will probably pull in other things via relative URL because requirejs allows that  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which we did!  \n11:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if you do, you're going to break prod  \n11:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0:)  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there'sno other way  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to support NS  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's either we don't support NS in zipexplorer  \n11:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we do this which I find very acceptable  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need other people's opinions here  \n11:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Anca's on the phone but I'll grab her as soon as she's off :D  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0make sure to mention that if it's not that then no NS support  \n11:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0refusing to support zipexplorer for NS would be ok because when people upgrade, it won't explode  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is also going to break prod in the future)  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it'll explode  \n11:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it'll explode when people move things into NS's  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whenever they create a new page and try to use the plugin  \n11:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0which is a bit expected  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they'll move by default  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since creating a new page created a NS  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*creates  \n11:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hrm  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes at least it'll work when they upgrade if they don't touch anything  \n11:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's a big deal because people are in a bad mood when they are upgrading and it's never a good idea to give them reason to think about you when they are in that mental state  \n11:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0better they face that issue another day  \n11:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Is there really no way to hack zipexplorer NS support ?  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see a realistic one  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but really  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if they comptue the url themselves when we provide an api  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's really themseves they can blame for it  \n11:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\"they\" are long gone  \n11:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the person who will be mad will be the person upgrading  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0its like using a bug and then compaining when it's fixed  \n11:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0re Sim City  \n11:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0memory allocator  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the thing is this is an old plugin that is not used that often  \n11:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's used enough  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then I know what I can do, commenting  \n11:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Windows 95 team tested each application while upgrading because their logic was that if someone bought Sim City and then a year later they bought Windows 95, upgraded and Sim City stopped working, they would not call Sim City and demand to return it, they would take Windows 95 back to the store  \n11:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0And in the case of Sim City, it was using memory after it was freed, something which happened to work ok with the older memory allocator but with the new (more agressive) one it caused crashes  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0new proposal: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12438?focusedCommentId=87509&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-87509  \n11:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so they wrote a special detection mode which detected Sim City and switched the memory allocator to preserve memory when it was freed so that it would not crash  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: the new ?path= parameter you propose would be a new thing ?  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the zipexplorer plugin is not the reason people use xwiki :)  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes  \n11:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sort of but zipexplorer is in common use  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway look at my last proposal cjd  \n11:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0right, that should work  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which btw I can only do by breaking backward compat slightly  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: what \"Make it work\" means exactly  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0?  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commenting on that since I didn't mention it  \n11:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think it could be a tiny bit more clever but that will at least mean that upgrades do work  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commented  \n12:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hm  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commented more  \n12:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0should work  \n12:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I would put some 3vil hax in DownloadAction  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: won't URL parameter based path break navigation is a zip like a javadoc package for example ?  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not enough  \n12:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mm actually what you're doing is indeed ok  \n12:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which used to be our main use case for zip plugin  \n12:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0just make sure that any other plugins which implement downloadAttachment() do not explode fantastically if they get a null  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you mean getFileTreeList()?  \n12:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and then put the 3vil in the plugin  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: no idea what getFileTreeList() is, I mean you access the root index.html in a javadoc package and then click a link -> you end up nowhere  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I see what you mean  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed that will break it I think  \n12:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so we are forced to use /zipexplorer/space/space/document/attachment/path/to/whatever.html  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can introduce a marker in the URL in the new format  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since that's the way we used to document API in http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/API it does not sounds very acceptable to break it  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to separate the attachment part from the zip path part  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as a rest api would do)  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example:  \n12:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\u00a0/download/space/space/document/attachment//path/to/whatever.html ?  \n12:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if zipexplorer has its own URL an easy one is /zipexplorer/space.space.document@attachment/path/to/whatever.html but it's not very consistent with other URLs  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex: /download/space1/space2/page/attachment/zippath/path/inside/zip yes  \n12:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0remember I said that we should not allow a nested space with the same name as an attachment?
