 \nxwiki-bridge - (16:39): [Vincent Massol] ideally we should choose one way or another and keep it for consistency, no very important, but nicer  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:39): [Vincent Massol] J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter: re section how will it work if we don't have one?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:39): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] I mean both are bundled together in the same jar, it's just one feature in the end  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:39): [Vincent Massol] in your doc is says you need a section macro  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:39): [Vincent Massol] ohhh  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:39): [Vincent Massol] that's not clear  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:39): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] yes. maybe I should add that  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:39): [Vincent Massol] hmmm  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [Vincent Massol] better to have 2 entries or have one named \"Section & Column Macro\" or something like that  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] no, you are not convincing me we need to separate the 2:)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] yes maybe \"section and column\" is better name  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [Vincent Massol] or section macro  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [Vincent Massol] since column is the content of the section macro  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [Vincent Massol] what happens when you use the column macro without a section?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] so that would be SectionAndColumnMacro20  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] I don't know  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] I have to read the code, it's been some time now  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] honestly I \u00a0prefer column as name, it makes sense by itself  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:40): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] while section I would have doubt of what it is  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:41): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] wdyt about I rename to SectionAndColumnMacro20 and explain both are bundled   \nxwiki-bridge - (16:41): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:41): [Vincent Massol] since they are both valid macros, each shyould have its page actually  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:41): [Vincent Massol] same as for footnote macros  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] actuallyt that's a bad example  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] I'm not so convinced  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] it scatters the documentation  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] no it's note  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] not  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] not really  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] they are different  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] if I show you the confluence doc  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] for both section and column  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] yes but it's one feature in the end  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [Vincent Massol] will you be convinced?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] please do  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:42): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:43): [Vincent Massol] http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Column+Macro  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:43): [Vincent Massol] http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Section+Macro  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:43): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:45): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] honestly not very convinced still  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:45): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] but no strong feelings, I can do it if it's the rule  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:45): [Vincent Massol] you need to define the behavior of the column macro when used standalone too  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [Vincent Massol] since it's a macro that can be used by users  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [Vincent Massol] in standalone mode  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] would mean we have share download page  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [Vincent Massol] using the wysiwyg editor for ex  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [Vincent Massol] you could share the same download page  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] right but it just make no sense to do that  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [Vincent Massol] if it's a question of packaging together  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:46): [Vincent Massol] packaging together is fine with me  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:47): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] (I was talking about standalone section when I said it makes no sense,)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:47): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:47): [Vincent Massol] (yep got it)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:47): [J\u00e9r\u00f4me Velociter] fine by me  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:47): [Vincent Massol] I don't know what others think  \nplunden left at 16:52 (jordan.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nKermitTheFragger left at 16:52 (jordan.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nxwiki-bridge left at 16:54 (jordan.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 16:54  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 16:59  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 16:59  \nplunden left at 17:11 (jordan.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nKermitTheFragger left at 17:11 (jordan.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 17:15  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 17:15  \nplunden left at 17:33 (jordan.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nKermitTheFragger left at 17:33 (jordan.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 17:39  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 17:39  \nplunden left #xwiki at 17:41  \nKermitTheFragger left at 18:09 (jordan.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 18:29  \nKermitTheFragger left at 18:58 (\"Leaving\"  \nxwiki-bridge left at 21:44 (  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 21:45  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 23:06  \n\n"}
