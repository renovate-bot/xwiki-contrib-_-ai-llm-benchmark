I was thinking along the lines of adding suport for the exclusion..  \n03:54\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I was thinking at the query level, but that seems little ambiguous  \n03:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0This means that instead of the default Main.LuceneSearch document, someone edits it or copies it someplace else, and includes (hardcoded) an \"-mimetype:image/\\*\" term in the query  \n03:54\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0so thought will do it in xwiki.cfg  \n03:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or another example, a mandatory condition: \"+mimetype:application/pdf\" in a \"Search PDFs\" documents  \n03:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But yes, the title of the issue was a bit misleading  \n03:56\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0oh. .k.. thanks for the clarification..  \n03:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You're welcome  \n03:57\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0So, i have already included the index field for mime type..  \n03:57\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0I could send a pull request?

 \n23:22\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: I was following this installation guide : http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationGlassFish  \n23:22\u00a0<ries>\u00a0and there it states : select the XWiki WAR archive to deploy and set the context root to xwiki (anything else will make XWiki navigation break)  \n23:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm...  \n23:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That's not true...  \n23:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It should work very well with any name  \n23:22\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I think I already know what it means\u2026. so you must runs as http://domain/xwiki  \n23:22\u00a0<ries>\u00a0Ok...  \n23:22\u00a0<ries>\u00a0may I ask you a other question ?  \n23:23\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sure  \n23:23\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I am getting an exception during deployment : could not create Vfs.Dir from url, no matching UrlType was found [bundle://176.0:1/]  \n23:23\u00a0<ries>\u00a0From what I was googling 'something' with reflections  \n23:23\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I am still researching this...  \n23:23\u00a0<ries>\u00a0But, doe sthat ring a bell?  \n23:23\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, usually that can be ignored if the wiki starts fine  \n23:24\u00a0<ries>\u00a0It does a redirect to http:/127.0.0.1/xwiki/bin/view/Main/  \n23:24\u00a0<ries>\u00a0and then I see javax.servlet.ServletException: PWC1243: Filter execution threw an exception  \n23:24\u00a0<ries>\u00a0Could it have something to do with the fact that I try to run it over https?  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It should work with https  \n23:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Can you pastebin the whole stacktrace?  \n23:26\u00a0<ries>\u00a0yes I can  \n23:27\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I might have missed something...  \n23:30\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I didn't setup my DB\u2026 I thought the section was specially for MySQL on that page\u2026. \\_s  \n23:38\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: going to do a re-deploy to find a proper start point of the deployment  \n23:38\u00a0<ries>\u00a0currently the log get's filled fast with log messages  \n23:56\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: here is teh full stacktrace : http://pastebin.com/6QNFPSHv  \n23:57\u00a0<ries>\u00a0Currently I don't see the database beeing created\u2026 so I think I should start there  \n23:57\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, at the end of the log, I see this:  \n23:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0xwiki was successfully deployed in 20,765 milliseconds  \n23:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So although the error is repeated several times, it seems to be ignored  \n23:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0When you open the wiki in the browser, what does it do?
