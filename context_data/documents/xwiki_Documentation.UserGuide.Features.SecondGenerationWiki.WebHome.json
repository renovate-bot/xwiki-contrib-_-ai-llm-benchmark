Second generation wikis (a.k.a Structured and Applications Wikis) can be used to create collaborative web applications (by using the wiki paradigm and editing wiki pages). XWiki can be used either as a first generation wiki or a second generation one.\n \n## First generation wikis\n\n Focused on **content** creation. Some example of features:\n * #### [Page editing](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing)\n\n\nUse simple wiki syntax to format text, create tables, create links, display images, etc. Alternatively use a powerful WYSIWYG editor to edit the content of pages.\n* #### [Version Control](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/VersionControl)\n\n\nAny change made in XWiki is saved under version control, meaning you can view any previous version of a page, compare different versions or rollback to any past version.\n* #### [Rights](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RightsManagement)\n\n\nControl who can view, edit or delete pages in a flexible manner. Apply rights to a page, its children or an entire wiki.\n* #### [Search](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Search%20Application)\n\n\nAllows searching on the full wiki using wildcards, faceting search results, getting search result RSS feeds and more.\n* #### [Exports](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Exports)\n\n\nExport wiki pages to PDF, ODT, RTF, XML or HTML.\n\n\n\n## Second generation wikis\n\n Focused on **[structure](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/DataModel/)** and **application** creation (by editing wiki pages). Some examples of what can be created:\n * #### [Blog](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Blog%20Application)\n\n\nHost one or multiple blogs to communicate information or organise it using categories and tags.\n* #### [File Manager](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/File%20Manager%20Application)\n\n\nManage your folders and files, having viewers for many supported file types (such as office and PDF), displaying a tag cloud and allowing filtering.\n* #### [Meetings](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Meeting%20Application)\n\n\nOrganise meetings (create, view and modify meetings to come) and send invitations.\n* #### [Forums](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/ForumApplication)\n\n\nDiscuss important topics using multiple forums that support answers, comments and votes.\n* #### [Tasks](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Task%20Manager%20Application)\n\n\nCreate and assign tasks for designated projects, with associated assignees and due dates.\n\n\n\n\n Today most of user's needs are not satisfied because it takes too long and it's too costly to develop small applications. On the other hand, a second generation wiki like XWiki is a perfect platform for this. **XWiki is the toolkit for the web**!## Next steps\n\n If you're interested in learning how to write an application with XWiki, check out [App Within Minutes](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/App%20Within%20Minutes%20Application), our tool to easily create applications, even by non developers.\n\n You can also browse through the hundreds of [Applications](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/) (and more generally Extensions) developed on top of XWiki. They can be installed in your wiki using the [Extension Manager](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Extension%20Manager%20Application).\n\n Once you've mastered it and if you wish to go further, check the [Programming features](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Programming), followed by the [Developer's Guide](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/).\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Did you know?\n\n\n\n Chris Anderson introduced the concept of [Long Tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail). \n[![xwikilongtail.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/SecondGenerationWiki/WebHome/xwikilongtail.png?rev=1.7)](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/SecondGenerationWiki/WebHome/xwikilongtail.png?rev=1.7)\n Applying it to XWiki gives the above diagram.\n \n\n What it means is that there are thousands and thousands of applications required by users that are **not** built today because of prohibitive *complexity* and *costs* (the yellow area is larger than the red area on the diagram).\n\n\nThey would also take too long to build and their value would decrease as more and more time passes for their implementation.\n\n\nThey need to be created here and now to have the highest possible value. \n\n\nXWiki is a cost-effective solution that allows non-developers to create those required applications quickly and in an organic manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
