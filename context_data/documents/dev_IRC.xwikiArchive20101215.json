It's just it seems i didn't have to import xwiki-enterprise-manager-wiki-administrator-<version>.xar  \nsburjan - (10:52): which I can't explain why  \nvmassol1 - (10:52): because you already had a mysql db running somewhere  \nsburjan - (10:53): yes, i have  \nsburjan - (10:53): had and have  \ntmortagne - (10:53): with an old instance already in it  \nsburjan - (10:53): so XEM app actually resides in the db ?  \nsburjan - (10:53): yes, exactly  \nsburjan - (10:54): a 2.6 instance (in mysql)  \ntmortagne - (10:54): everything resides in the db  \ntmortagne - (10:54): every datas  \nsburjan - (10:54): I imagined that the XAR pages are actually copied somewhere outside the database  \nsburjan - (10:54): so actually the xwikipages are in database only ?  \nsburjan - (10:55): this is a general question  \ntmortagne - (10:55): what would be in the database then ? :)  \nsburjan - (10:55): content of the pages > :P  \nsburjan - (10:55): tags, comments, etc  \ntmortagne - (10:55): so not content but metadatas then  \nsburjan - (10:55): yes:)  \ntmortagne - (10:56): thing is f you don't have all in the database you can't request it  \nsburjan - (10:56): so when importing any XAR, all the xar contents is inserted into the DB ? (no additional files on disk) ?  \ntmortagne - (10:56): yep nothing in disk  \nsburjan - (10:56): interesting  \ntmortagne - (10:56): that's the basics  \ntmortagne - (10:56): it's not exactly true for extension manager  \ntmortagne - (10:57): which has a local repository of the extensions but that's another thing  \nsburjan - (10:57): yes, because extension manager downloads jar's .. and those aren't inserted in db  \ntmortagne - (10:58): it also have xar in its repository but it's not for runtime, it's to keep a \"safe\" version of what it installed for upgrades  \nsburjan - (10:58): yeah ...  \nsburjan - (10:58): and for example if I want to \"upgrade\" the manager-administrator xar, I have to reimport it, right ?  \nsburjan - (10:59): so a new version of pages will be created with the latest 2.7 snapshot  \ntmortagne - (10:59): yes and take care of not importing pages you would have modified  \ntmortagne - (10:59): but in your case you probably don't care  \ntmortagne - (10:59): you want to put standard one  \nsburjan - (11:00): I guess I should Un-check the import as default package (never knew what does this checkbox)  \nsburjan - (11:02): tmortagne: do you accidentally have a XE 2.7 snapshot ?  \ntmortagne - (11:02): i don't see what yopu mean by \"import as default package\"  \ntmortagne - (11:02): sburjan: i don't have much, i'm on a temporary half installed dev env on win7  \nsburjan - (11:03): Admin Section - Import - Upload Xar, press Import .. you have various options .. keep history, reset to version 1, and also impost as backup package  \nsburjan - (11:03): backup package, not default, sorry  \ntmortagne - (11:03): ok, in you case it's a backup import  \ntmortagne - (11:03): don't disable it  \nsburjan - (11:03): ok  \nMenso joined #xwiki at 11:04  \nsburjan - (11:04): I though if it's a backup, it won't be used at all  \ntmortagne - (11:04): backup means keep author basically  \ntmortagne - (11:04): and in XE/XEM you have rights settings  \ntmortagne - (11:04): so author is important  \nsburjan - (11:05): I see  \nsburjan - (11:05): thanks for en-lighting me :)  \ntmortagne - (11:05): you'r welcome  \nMenso - (11:08): good morning  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 11:13  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 11:21  \nsburjan - (11:27): I have a question.

We have two jars in WEB-INF/lib for JSON processing: json-20080701.jar and org.json-2.0.jar The first one is an optional dependency of jodconverter, required only if you use the JsonDocumentFormatRegistry --> \u00a0so in order to enable jSON configuration for office importer I had to add json-20080701.jar as dependency of office importer, which works fine. It seems that   \nmflorea - (19:50): // This is a nice array  \nmflorea - (19:50): [1, 2, ,3]  \nmflorea - (19:50): is parsed by json-20080701.jar but not by org.json-2.0.jar  \nmflorea - (19:50): I'll investigate this problem a bit later. Now I have to finish something else. I suspect we have to exclude org.json-2.0.jar as a transitive dependency.  \nrrodriguez left at 20:20 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 20:36  \nsdumitriu1 joined #xwiki at 20:51  \nsdumitriu left at 20:51 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsdumitriu1 is now known as sdumitriu ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nsburjan` - (21:06): sdumitriu: indeed me messages aren't logged. they never were. we don't have an event for that  \nsdumitriu - (21:07): Something to fix care in the future, if possible  \nsdumitriu - (21:08): sburjan`: Do you want to take ownership of the IRCBot application?  \nsdumitriu - (21:08): Do you have time for it?  \nsburjan` - (21:09): sdumitriu: I could in my 20% optional time, but there are certain issues I won't be able to do alone. and the me thing IMO is not worth logging  \nsburjan` - (21:10): wdyt ? we need something minmal  \nsdumitriu - (21:13): There are many things that can be improved  \nsdumitriu - (21:13): For example, the bot should be administered from the Administration page  \nsburjan` - (21:13): and what ownership would mean ?  \nsdumitriu - (21:14): The archive pages should have a better title  \nsdumitriu - (21:14): (including the date)  \nsdumitriu - (21:14): The archive pages should have a parent  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 21:14  \nsburjan` - (21:14): yesm I thought about that  \nsburjan` - (21:14): well.. if you don't need anything ASAP ..
