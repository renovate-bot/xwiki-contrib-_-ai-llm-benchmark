So we can have a two class classifier which can classify a bad and good edit. The problem will be to have a training data and also the notion of good and bad will be different for each domain.  \nancutagheorghe - (27/03/2009 16:16): and for now i have the standalone working .. but it doesn't help me very much .. because i can not edit tables etc  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:21): ancutagheorghe: Why do you need to edit tables?  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:22): And you can do that with hsqldb also  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:22): kiransarv: You could start with some obvious samples and then do a continuous, online trainig of the classifier  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:22): This separation only has meaning for large public sites, where there are lots of edits that can be used as training data  \nancutagheorghe - (27/03/2009 16:23): i was thinking about tables for lists .. black lists , white lists ...  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:24): Heh, just update the mapping file  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:24): Hibernate auto-creates the tables at startup  \nancutagheorghe - (27/03/2009 16:24): ok :)  \nancutagheorghe - (27/03/2009 16:25): REALLY?  \nancutagheorghe - (27/03/2009 16:25): i think i should start reading about hibernate :D  \nmib\\_albnxp - (27/03/2009 16:28): sdumitriu : In the calneder project from where can I start working on it???  \nkiransarv - (27/03/2009 16:33): wikipedia provides all versions for each page...! So a page which has been classified as a \"bad edit\" or \"spam\" by admin might be mined. Also there has been research done on detection of spam in blogs and comments... I will look into these as a starting point.  \namila325 - (27/03/2009 16:42): hi  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:42): Hi amila325  \namila325 - (27/03/2009 16:42): where can i find the previous Photo album in XWiki  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:42): Wait a bit  \namila325 - (27/03/2009 16:42): k  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:44): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-applications/trunk/photoalbum/  \namila325 - (27/03/2009 16:44): thanks, im interested in GSOC photo album application  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:44): You can see it live here: http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Photos/  \nxwikibot - (27/03/2009 16:47): GoogleSummerOfCode.student application form was modified by xwiki:XWiki.Sergiu - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/student+application+form  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:48): SoC students, it is important to answer the \"have you applied for other projects\" question, to let us know what your general interests and abilities are  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:48): Listing other organizations does not diminish your chances of being accepted with us  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:48): But it gives us a more general view of you  \nancutagheorghe - (27/03/2009 16:50): ok :)  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:51): Looks like there are a lot of students interested in the AntiVandalism project this year...  \nsdumitriu - (27/03/2009 16:51): Last year alsmot nobody wanted it  \nancutagheorghe - (27/03/2009 16:52): :)  \nancutagheorghe - (27/03/2009 16:52): if i want to apply for another project as well, in case i will not be chosen for this one .. do i have to make an entore plan for that one as well?
