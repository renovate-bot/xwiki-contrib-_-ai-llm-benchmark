If you specify width/height in percent, they are relative to the container width/height. 85% of 0 height is 0. Maybe when you export as PDF the page height is unknown (so 0) and thus the computed image height is 0. I don't have other explanation.  \nmflorea - (14:11): wait, ignore me, I thought of something else, when percent is specified on image, it's from the original size  \nmflorea - (14:11): so it should work  \nkwoot - (14:11): so what's next? shall I make a ticket in Jira or do you want additional input?  \nmflorea - (14:13): hmm, actually I just checked and I was right, it's 85% of the page height not the original image height.  \nmflorea - (14:13): kwoot: why do you need to specify the height  \nsabageru joined #xwiki at 14:13  \nkwoot - (14:14): No, not me, a user resized his uploaded picture using width and height settings.  \nmflorea - (14:14): I see  \nmflorea - (14:15): go ahead and open a jira issue  \nkwoot - (14:15): the uploaded picture is to big to fit on the screen and the default skin does not seem to allow for horizontal scroll bars at the bottom when the content is too wide.  \nmflorea - (14:16): sure, but it's enough to resize the width because the height is resized automatically  \nmflorea - (14:16): it's always better to specify just one dimensions so that image aspect ratio is preserved  \nmflorea - (14:16): so either width or height, but width it better  \nkwoot - (14:23): jira ticket made: XWIKI-5726  \nkwoot - (14:24): In the mean time, I will inform my user that only width should work since xwiki keeps the aspect ratio the same.  \nvenkatna left at 14:25 (Remote host closed the connection  \nrrodriguez left at 14:30 (Quit: rrodriguez  \njstoldt joined #xwiki at 14:39  \njstoldt - (14:39): hi  \njstoldt - (14:39): i got a problem with the OOo server function  \njstoldt - (14:39): it fails not just to start on 2.6  \njstoldt - (14:40): but trying to start it from admin panel gives me an error  \njstoldt - (14:41): http://pastebin.ca/2001968  \njstoldt - (14:41): error log when starting the server^^  \njstoldt - (14:42): trying to connect makes this log appear on the page: http://pastebin.ca/2001969  \nvmassol - (14:42): templateProfileDir must exist and be a directory  \nvmassol - (14:42): so does it point to a dir?  \njstoldt - (14:43): server log for this: http://pastebin.ca/2001971  \njstoldt - (14:43): i can't see any dir  \njstoldt - (14:43): and it used to work on 2.5  \njstoldt - (14:46): no changes done on the OOo installation  \nvmassol - (14:47): this is the profilePath config  \nvmassol - (14:47): openoffice.profilePath  \njstoldt - (14:47): oh, just remembered something  \nvmassol - (14:47): make sure it points to a dir and that you have write access to it  \njstoldt - (14:47): yep, that might indeed be the problem!  \njstoldt - (14:47): i changed tomcat there  \nvmassol - (14:49): snowing heavily here\u2026.. ;)  \njstoldt - (14:49): it stopped here for the moment... i don't like snow  \nsburjan - (14:49): jstoldt: I tested with 2.6 and it works (Using ubuntu)  \njstoldt - (14:50): yeah, i figure it's my bad  \njstoldt - (14:50): i changed the logon settings of tomcat  \nsburjan - (14:50): you're using win or linux ?  \njstoldt - (14:50): so it's now running under a different user  \njstoldt - (14:50): nope, win 7  \nsburjan - (14:50): oh  \njstoldt - (14:50): you put me back on track  \nsburjan - (14:50): check the default install path of OO on documentation, and modify it in the proprieties file  \njstoldt - (14:50): fixed it :)  \nsburjan - (14:50): great :)  \ncjdelisle is now known as cjdelisle` ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nsburjan left at 14:53 (Quit: Ex-Chat  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 14:53  \ncjdelisle` left at 14:57 (Changing host  \ncjdelisle` joined #xwiki at 14:57  \ncjdelisle` left at 15:01 (Quit: oops wrong button  \njbrBridge left at 15:01 (Remote host closed the connection  \njbrBridge joined #xwiki at 15:05  \ncjdelisle` joined #xwiki at 15:05  \nsilviar left at 15:14 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \njstoldt - (15:23): i still got huge trouble with attachments  \njstoldt - (15:23): and i really can not figure out what is causing them  \ncjdelisle` - (15:23): What's the problem?  \njstoldt - (15:24): just now i tried to delete a series of jpgs created from the importer and got the following message for each one of them in tomcat log  \njstoldt - (15:24): 2010-11-25 15:20:39,290 [http://localhost/bin/delete/Konstruktionsrichtlinien/Zeichnungserstellung?confirm=1&form\\_token=50KsAtCot8FZmmYw40wyfA] WARN \u00a0doc.XWikiAttachment \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Failed to load content for attachment [ZeichnungserstellungRichtl-slide7.jpg@Konstruktionsrichtlinien.Zeichnungserstellung].
