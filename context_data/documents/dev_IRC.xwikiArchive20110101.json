Am I in the right place for XWiki Enterprise?  \n18:50\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0Anybody here who can help with an initial connection to PostgreSQL?  \n18:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi DrLou  \n18:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n18:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Did you read http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/AdminGuide/InstallationPostgreSQL ?  \n19:15\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0sdumitriu: Yes, indeed - diligently!  \n19:15\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0but I'm not finding it possible to use it exactly...  \n19:15\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0(is a restart of the domain required between each config change?)  \n19:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Only changes in the configuration files (xwiki.cfg, xwiki.properties, hibernate.cfg.xml)  \n19:17\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0I assume you're saying 'yes', must restart, if I change one of those files...? \u00a0So I better start doing this.  \n19:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, restart  \n19:18\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0This is in GlassFish, btw...  \n19:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0OK, tks for your help. It was simply that I needed to restart to get things going. I thought I had a problem using a connection pool.  \n19:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Did you also read http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationGlassFish ?  \n19:20\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0(Now, presumably, must install some 'sample' pages...)  \n19:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, download the XAR from http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/Main/Download  \n19:21\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0Yes, I've read most (all?) readily-available docs. They don't exactly follow what one would now see using the GF 3.1 admin console.  \n19:21\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0(I'd be happy to help edit the Wiki a bit...)  \n19:24\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The registration is open  \n19:24\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Please feel free to contribute  \n19:48\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:48\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n19:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n21:35\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0Is xWiki an 'active' community?  \n21:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Not sure how you define 'active' but I think it is.  \n21:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Somewhat less active during the holidays though.  \n21:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:06\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0How would one, by default, import the sample pages xar file for xWiki - from the GlassFish 3.1 admin ?  \n22:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation#HInstallingtheDefaultWikiXAR  \n22:11\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0Thank You!  \n22:13\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0(Good. I had been searching GF docs, thinking 'import' was a GF function...)  \n22:13\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0noobie stuff, I know.  \n22:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0no pb.  \n22:17\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0Another confusing thing for (most) noobs?: Link on the import page - saying the wiki is empty, is incorrect. Correct is: http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-wiki/2.7/xwiki-enterprise-wiki-2.7.xar  \n22:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:59\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:16\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0If we've already got GlassFish, where does the eXo platform fit into the mix - if at all?  \n23:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's another option for a platform. I'm not sure as to the level of support though.  \n23:21\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0When you say 'another', do you mean as an \\_alternative\\_ to GlassFish? \u00a0Or does it run inside GF?  \n23:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not sure if exo runs on top of a servlet or if it is standalone.  \n23:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0From xwiki's perspective, it is a separate platform which insulates xwiki from the rest of the system.  \n23:51\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n23:56\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
