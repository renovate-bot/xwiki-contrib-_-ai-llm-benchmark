We can close it later but IMO it's nice to have documentation on it.  \n16:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I'll also change the test so it \"proves\" the issue instead of failing from it.  \n16:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0BTW: document versioning infrastructure is very good. the irc log typically runs up into the thousands of versions without issue.  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I think it would be nice to have the message stream UI part (the part to enter a new message) out of the activity macro as a separate macro and then add a gadget on the home page to use it  \n16:27\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0lucaa: yes I think it does make sense  \n16:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0jvelociter: can you send that on the list, please?  \n16:27\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0there are use cases where you would want to have your document saved immediatly  \n16:27\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0yes  \n16:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0jvelociter: it's exactly my view, I think because it's created from a template, it already has data, and so it makes sense to want it created immediately  \n16:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0saved immediately I mean  \n16:29\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0lucaa: save and edit is interesting too  \n16:29\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0if you want to materialize the document immediatly and then let the use edit parts  \n16:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, it's the case of dashboards, I would probably want save and edit  \n16:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0to save the document and let the user customize it  \n16:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0immediately  \n16:31\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it's a little hackish for the dashboard, I wouldn't want it if I could really make it work, but there are a few limitations in that area. The way dashboard is edited is a bit too complex for the way the template system & new document \u00a0works  \n16:32\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: do you have time to update Freshmeat and Wikimatrix for the 3.0RC1?  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: wild idea: would it make sense to have a syntax in XWiki Syntax 2.1 or beyond to say: this headings should be of level N+1 where N is the level of the previous header. This would solve some use cases where you're including docs or sections in other docs/sections  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: yep doing it  \n16:32\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: can you update wikipedia?  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: something like =++ header ++= ;)  \n16:32\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: thanks  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: of course we can currently do that with a velocity macro but it's complex. Anyway it's just a wild idea  \n16:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: problem is that it's not only syntax, you need the information in the XDOM too since the number will be resolver after include is executed  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed it would be saved i the XDOM  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in HeadingBlock  \n16:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but its a nice idea  \n16:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0deserve a jira \"idea\" issue I think ;)  \n16:36\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok will create it  \n16:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: idea for RN: show screenshot for the improved profile avatar selection  \n16:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: ok, will do  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: done for freshmeat, wikimatrix and wikipedia  \n16:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0super  \n16:43\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n16:43\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0older xwikiers, do you remember why we have different actions for objectadd and object remove?  \n16:43\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0e.g. sdumitriu, vmassol, jvelociter, tmortagne ?  \n16:43\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0arkub: ?  \n16:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: that's older than me :)  \n16:43\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(and they're not handled by the save action)  \n16:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep  \n16:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The code that updates objects from request only recognizes the objects that already exist  \n16:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: K, I'm on it  \n16:44\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sdumitriu: yes, I know.

I wonder if there is stuff I need to take into account  \n16:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0lucaa: There's no good reason for objectadd  \n16:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If you can make it work the same only with save, then +1  \n16:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0(but -1 for removing it yet, it's hardcoded in applications)  \n16:46\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0lucaa: if you can make save handle new objects that'd be quite great  \n16:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually it will continue to be used, it can't be removed  \n16:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's needed in create forms  \n16:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0(calendar app)  \n16:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Unless it recognizes special kind of parameters  \n16:47\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0XWiki.SomeClass\\_prop=value as oposed to XWiki.SomeClass\\_4\\_prop=value  \n16:50\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0yep that could be the norm for new objects  \n16:51\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0but if it could handle multiple new objects that would be also quite nice  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: actually it's bad idea I think  \n16:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha ?  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: it's probably better to implement this as a parameter of the include macro  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normalizeHeadings=true  \n16:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep it's certainly easier to do (from refactoring POV)  \n16:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0should probably be the default in include macro actually WDYT ?  \n16:52\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0jvelociter: yes, I am looking at that. what I will try to cover is dashboard editing, which includes: editing existing objects, removing objects (multiple), adding objects (multiple)  \n16:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm no  \n16:55\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0lucaa sounds nice and with a lot of use cases besides dashboards  \n16:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0also, could I have more opinions on \"default edit mode for a page\" ? I would like to implement it asap, since it makes dashboard non-editable for simple users  \n16:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0jvelociter: yes, I know, it would be nice.
