As I understand it, you can use classes to add some database-like functionality to the info you keep on the wiki  \n14:51\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0I'm having some problem with the \"page\" field for classes - I though it let me link an object to a page (document) on the wiki  \n14:51\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0but when I create such a field, it won't actually let me pick any real page on the wiki  \n14:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm, let me take a look  \n14:51\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0if its a list (default) then it's an empty list, of I make it an input field than it rejects my input  \n14:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Page is a relatively new field so I'm not familiar with it  \n14:52\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0thinking I may need a query, but not sure how to structure that  \n14:52\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0If there's another (better/easier) way of doing it, then happy to listen  \n14:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0No that seems correct, what are the settings you have put for the class field ?  \n14:54\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0the one labeled \"XWiki Class Name\"? Nothing, although I tried creating a new class, no luck there  \n14:54\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0should I have \"xwiki.document\" or something?  \n14:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0there should be a bunch of them, multiselect, relational storage, sql, class name, etc  \n14:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0maybe just grab a screen cap of that  \n14:55\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0It's pretty much all blank  \n14:56\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0is there documentation on how the Page field works somewhere?  \n14:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't see anything by a few searches but what might help you is that a Page is actually a DBList  \n14:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Now try setting the SQL field to \u00a0\u00a0select doc.fullName, doc.title from XWikiDocument where 1=1  \n14:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0in the configuration for the page type  \n15:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0no luck there  \n15:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh wait that's bad sql  \n15:03\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0haha  \n15:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Now try setting the SQL field to \u00a0\u00a0select doc.fullName, doc.title from XWikiDocument doc where 1=1  \n15:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sorrt  \n15:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*sorry  \n15:03\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0That's getting somewhere  \n15:04\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0need to figure out a better query so that it doesn't list all the functional pages  \n15:04\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0thanks  \n15:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that should get you started anyway, now you can look at the XWiki HQL query instructions to narrow down the pages you select  \n15:05\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0does doc.fullname include the full path?  \n15:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0wow you are asking me all of the questions I am not sure of :) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think yes but Nested Spaces is only 2 releases old and I didn't participate in the development o fit.  \n15:06\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0I'll go digging  \n15:07\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:10\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n15:10\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:11\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n15:15\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:14\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:37\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n16:38\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0hmm  \n16:42\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:02\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0ok, I think I'm missing something about how to use xwiki best here  \n17:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0what's up ?  \n17:37\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0I want a page that can be edited as a normal wiki page, easy for users to put in whatever they think is relevant, but I'd also like it to have some structured data  \n17:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh, so you want to add a \"content\" field but you still want structured editing  \n17:37\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0right now I'm doing this by basically having 2 pages  \n17:38\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0one is an object instance of a class  \n17:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0right, you don't need to do that  \n17:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0are you creating the class with the App Within Minutes wizard ? \u00a0\u00a0I guess the answer is no...  \n17:38\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0and the other is a normal wiki page, with the structured stuff in a box, and in that box a display reference  \n17:38\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0but this feels dumb  \n17:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0You've created a class sheet to display and edit the objects of the class ?  \n17:39\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0Class is made using XWiki/XWikiClasses  \n17:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n17:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and for editing the object pages, you have a class edit sheet ?  \n17:40\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0theres an X Class, X Sheet and X Template docs  \n17:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0in X Sheet, you can add \u00a0\u00a0$doc.getContent() \u00a0and it will display the content of the object-page  \n17:41\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0right now I'm messing around with the sheet, and making a horrible mess  \n17:41\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0Right, ok  \n17:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0err actually wait, I think you want \u00a0\u00a0$doc.display('content') \u00a0\u00a0I need to double check  \n17:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0there is a way to do it so that when you move into edit mode, it will also make it possible to edit the content along with viewing it  \n17:44\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0do I need to create a field called \"content\" in the class?  \n17:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0no  \n17:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you already have the content field because the class is also essentialy a wiki page  \n17:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh I have it  \n17:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you add a ComputedField called Content and then in CustomDisplay you put \u00a0\u00a0{{include reference=\"AppWithinMinutes.Content\"/}}  \n17:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0this stuff is a bit easier if you do it using AppWithinMinutes -- albeit a bit less flexible  \n17:48\u00a0<Chris[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n17:48\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<M-vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<blabla2[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Then after you've created a ComputedField called \"content\", you can add \u00a0\u00a0$doc.display('content') \u00a0and that should display the content when viewing and edit the content when editing  \n17:52\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0ok, think I follow that  \n17:53\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0going to need to tell it not to display the content field in the loop that shows the other fields  \n17:53\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0no you probably don't because it displays all existing fields in a loop and content becomes a field when you make it so  \n17:55\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n17:58\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0For the sake of the layout I was after I do  \n17:58\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0but easily done once I found a syntax guide for velocity  \n17:59\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0Hah yes, that edit page is almost exactly how I'd want it - it's got the data fields, but starts with a normal wiki box  \n17:59\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0thanks  \n17:59\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0although, there is random floating grey box  \n18:00\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0I don't quite understand what the \"X Template\" page is for mind  \n18:01\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0\"X Class\" defines the class, \"X Sheet\" defines how it appears. What does the template then do?  \n18:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Template contans any default values which you would like to set for every object of your class which could be overridden  \n18:01\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0ahhh  \n18:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so a new object of the class is basically a clone of the Template, so you can fill it with some instructions or other information which might help a user to fill in the blanks to create the page/object  \n18:09\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0one slight failure with this approach is that the preview button doesn't work  \n18:09\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0still, gives me an idea of what we can do sensibly with xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0thanks for the help today  \n18:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sure thing  \n18:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:36\u00a0<lincolna>\u00a0has quit  \n18:38\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<Chris[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<blabla2[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:33\u00a0<M-vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:55\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:12\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:27\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n23:01\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
