 \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by default \"normal\" user does not have the right to create a wiki, the admin need to explicitely give allgroup the right to do it  \n09:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but it's rare that main wiki admin don't have PR  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know that's supposed to be a feature :)  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the ability for non admins to create wikis)  \n09:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a wiki created from a template should not have the issue  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think copy document change the author  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why couldn't we set a user with PR in the context during the provisioning and put back the normal user after?  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not during the provisioning  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the use case here is when an empty wiki is created and you install the UI with DW  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0where the DW is executed with a user that does not have PR  \n09:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is guillaumeD on holidays today?
