The issue is that the creator, author and, most importantly for script right, contentAuthor are not set in the edited document... so the code coming from the template's content can not be executed because the current document's contentAuthor is null (guest).  \n10:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0In the case of the preview action, we are explicitly setting the contentAuthor to the current user so that in preview mode PR works with the current user's rights. (see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/web/PreviewAction.java#L111)  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I am wondering if we should do this inside EditAction#prepareEditedDocument (see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/web/EditAction.java#L85) so that all edit actions (inline, wiki, wysiwyg but also PreviewAction which inherits EditAction) behave in the same way (i.e. set the current user as author, contentAuthor and, in some cases, creator for the currently edited documen  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0The only noticeable behavior change I can imagine is that in an edit sheet (or in wysiwyg when previewing a velocity macro), doc.author, doc.contentAuthor and doc.creator will no longer display the previous author but will display the current context user. In WYSIWYG I can actually see this as an improvement, since it is currently not consistent with previewAction. For an edit sheet, if the previous author is really needed, the current document can be re-fet  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0WDYT?  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow long and complex test to parse :)  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I know... gotta love IRC for this sort of stuff :)  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but it's not that complicated actually  \n10:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems ok but I don't master the consequences as I don't know this code  \n10:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I remember the admin action also had a similar problem, but I`ve fixed that by using the display script service. A better fix would have been to make the admin action inherit from edit action and apply the logic above.  \n10:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne, mflorea: any objections to setting the current user as author/contentAuthor/(if isNew)creator for the currently edited document inside the EditAction directly?  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on my problem, I've jsut found out that the only test that calls setParent is actually CompareVersionsTest\u2026 meaning we don't have any func test for verifying that setting the parent works fine  \n10:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0IMO, it should have been that way rom the start  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it probably got broken in GD's refactoring, checking what he did  \n10:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: I remember seeing some tests that were setting the parent in edit mode  \n10:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0in the past  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe my grep wasn't good  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I've used find usage from my IDE so should be ok  \n10:50\u00a0<meatcar>\u00a0has quit  \n10:52\u00a0<meatcar>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, I get the same results  \n10:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0maybe it was this one...  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I don't understan Enygma` is that the hiearchy icon in edit mode has been there for a while AFAIK  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I don't see how CopareVersionsTest could have worked before our NS changes since setParent() doesn't click on it  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus when it tries to change the parent field, it says it's not visible (obviusly)  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0well, maybe Guillaume removed all the tests about it when he disabled the parent change button by default  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0otherwise the build would have failed  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've checked  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and GD didn't change the hierarchy icon behavior  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was there before  \n10:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0no, I mean the tests about it  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since we can`t find many right now  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but it would have meant they were all failing  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which wasn't the case  \n10:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0maybe I should run a test locally to better see what you mean  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you edit a page  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have this little hierarchy icon  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you click on it  \n10:56\u00a0<woshilap1n>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it displays the parent field  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that you can change it  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/Main/VMA?editor=wiki  \n10:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yep and now we need to put something in xwiki.preferences to have that again, right?  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure that's ok  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not the problem  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I have that change locally)  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is in WikiEditPage.setParent()  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the code there expects the parent field to be visible  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie that someone has clicked on the hierarchy icon before it's called)  \n10:58\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can change the code \u00a0to do that but I'm wondering how it could have passed before  \n10:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if (!this.parentInput.isDisplayed()) {  \n10:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0this.editParentTrigger.click();  \n10:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0looks like it clicks it if it`s not already clicked  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes indeed  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0missed that because it's failing on the line before that  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the find  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can now continue  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll fix a few things which are strange  \n11:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, cool  \n11:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, the test seems to be working with parentchild enabled  \n11:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but probably fails if I switch back to reference (since setParent will probably fail)  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good for you, fails locally here  \n11:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0what fails, setParent?  \n11:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0with parentchild enabled?  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've made some changes and it seems to be working now albeit very slowly locally each lines takes 30 s to execute  \n11:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n11:29\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok for some reasons it keeps failing locally, maybe some browser refresh, anyone going to commit and see how it goes on ci and I'll contine debugging  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: \"any objections to setting the current user as author/contentAuthor/(if isNew)creator for the currently edited document inside the EditAction directly\", content author supposed to change only if the content actually change  \n11:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, was thinking about that... though, for wysiwyg and wiki edit modes that is valid... for inline edit is not guaranteed and for object edit is not valid  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not guaranteed either for wiki and wysiwyg edit mode  \n11:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0even so, it's only for the in-memory document that is being edited. When actually saving, the contentAuthor will change in the DB only if the content actually changed as a result of the edit  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not that simple what is saved in the \"in-memory document\"  \n11:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0wdym?  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so if you change the author it will be saved in the DB too  \n11:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's for the edit display only I don't see the point since obviously the document was not modified  \n11:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I don't see why the author would change  \n11:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it will indicate wrong information to a sheet for example  \n11:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that`s what I`ve said above... $doc.author will show the current user instead of the previous author... but a sheet can re-fecth the document from the DB if it needs that info  \n11:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO the author should change when it make sense and setting the author when the document has not been modified in any way does not make sense  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not bring anything and force the UI to not trust the context document anymore...  \n11:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0in wysiwyg for example, when displaying a velocity macro... $doc.author displays \"\" (guest) for a new document  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also this would be a serious security issue in the WYSIWYG since the document would be executed with the right of the current user  \n11:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0in that case, it`s not exactly wysiwyg  \n11:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but don`t you want that?  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not when you start editing a document you did not wrote  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you start modify it then yes  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again the author should change when you actually change something  \n11:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0what bout the actual problem, regarding code content coming from template?  \n11:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0should the template document be used as security document, if a template document is specified?  \n11:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since that is where the code content comes from  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0pretty sure mflorea did something special for templates already but this is a different sibject  \n11:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(however, in wysiwyg or wiki edit mode you are then free to modify the content that came from a template so it does not make sense there)  \n11:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when using a sheet, the sheet document is the security document  \n11:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but for templates, I don`t see anything handled  \n11:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so, for example, AFAICT, we can not have PR code in templates right now  \n11:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since they are executed in the context of the current document  \n11:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the code(content) is simply copied in the current document  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well that's what a template is supposed to be, just a copy  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes...  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so you can not use a template that contains code if your user does not have script rights  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and that should make sense, right?  \n11:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0a workaround is for the template to have a sheet attached to it  \n11:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and that sheet should have PR/SR  \n11:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0or if you use template=X&sheet=Y....
