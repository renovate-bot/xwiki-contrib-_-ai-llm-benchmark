For this it seems the editor needs to output references with WebHome  \n10:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0by editor I mean the CKEditor  \n10:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the whole hiding WebHome thing is based on fallback system, if can't have both hidden WebHome and no fallback  \n10:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yes the editor you always serialize exact reference  \n10:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's the same issue with links to documents, it's not something specific to attachments  \n10:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and we already talked about that on the mailing list AFAIK  \n10:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for docs you can use the space: ref to target a WebHome page specifically  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure I agree  \n10:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you exchange WebHome for space which is pretty much the same level of complexity for basic user who is not supposed to know what a space is  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the wysiwyg uses full ref then it's going to modify user-entered references  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that's bad  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's going to transform [[label>>A.B]] into [[label>>A.B.WebHome]] after the save  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: why ? we are talking about new link or link explicitely modified by the WYSIWYG user here  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and users will see webhome (what we wanted to avoid)  \n10:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: links are modified only if you edit them  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the source reference is in a metadata in the HTML so going trough the WYSIWYG don't loose it  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: sure, but the result is the same, no?  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0users will get a WebHome  \n10:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if the user edits a link then yes  \n10:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but this is an explicit action on the link  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we have a jira issue already for this  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13083#  \n10:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the user may select a different page to link to, which is terminal so we may have to change the reference type  \n10:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes this is what I was talking about and which is about documents  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's not related to attachments, I was commenting on the \"so yes the editor you always serialize exact reference\"  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know the solution  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I know it's going to be a problem for users  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I rasied this issue because a user raised it to me first  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes this is also what I said, we started the discussion we did not concluded :)  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I just wanted to not start a new discussion for attachment since it's the same  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0agreed  \n10:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, so for now there's no way for the editor to hide WebHome in attachment references  \n10:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is you talk about space:, yes there is no space: support in \u00a0attachment resource references  \n10:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n10:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/is/if/  \n10:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0better ask Enygma`to be sure but I can't find any  \n10:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, attach: resources are directly handled as untyped link references  \n10:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0no support for attach:space: / attach:doc:  \n10:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since we did not take that route  \n11:00\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0has quit  \n11:03\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has quit  \n11:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:10\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:19\u00a0<M-vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:19\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has quit  \n11:19\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0has quit  \n11:32\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:01\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:03\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:05\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: there's no way to use an untyped reference to link from A.B.WebHome to A.WebHome (its parent) because [[A]] will be resolved and child/sibling  \n12:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0right?  \n12:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the only way is to use space:A  \n12:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0from A.B.C.WebHome to A.B.WebHome I can write [[A.B]], but in this case the reference has two spaces  \n12:33\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:33\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:34\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:34\u00a0<M-vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:08\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0yes, you need to use either space:A or [[A.WebHome]] or [[doc:A.WebHome]]  \n13:08\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0I would have personally preferred that our links are absolute by default  \n13:09\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0and that we user [[.A]] if we want them to be relative  \n13:09\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0but it`s too late for that now  \n13:09\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0is now known as <Enygma`>  \n13:44\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Hello  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi  \n13:52\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I'm working on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13318 and I would need to add a new boolean property (perSpace) to the XWiki.ConfigurableClass in order to use it in the query that gets all the applications configurations  \n13:53\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0So far, this query seems to return results only when the configureGlobally is 1: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/7392653655d1a8524c67851393b0ac16b07974f5/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-administration/xwiki-platform-administration-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/ConfigurableClassMacros.xml#L109  \n13:54\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0And there is no way to configure an installed application at space level  \n13:55\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Of course, I could add a new application manually in the { \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'id' : 'applications', \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'children' : [] \u00a0\u00a0} but I would avoid this solution because wouldn't be a general solution  \n13:57\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0WDYT?  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you need to majke a proposal first  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I understand if that you want to modify the configurable class feature  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to add a new feature to it  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that requires a proposal and a jira issue  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you have this already?  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(maybe I missed them)  \n13:58\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0no, I just asked now here  \n13:59\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I'm looking to see also if there could be other applications that would need a space level configuration  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so configurable class doesn't support dusplaying at space admin level?  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*displaying  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do have a several already  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but maybe they're not using configurable class  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which was introduced after them probably)  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have: rights, skin, etc  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed I agree that we need an option to display an Admin UI entry for a given space  \n14:00\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0no, they're not using configurable class  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at space level I mean  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would be useful anyway  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder why cjd hasn't done it, maybe didn't get the time  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(cjd coded the configurable class stuff)  \n14:01\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0there are some applications configured at space level but they are rather hardcoded that dynamically generated  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes ultimately we need to convert them to configurable class  \n14:02\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-administration/xwiki-platform-administration-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/AdminSheet.xml#L60  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we need to move everything to configurable class ideally)  \n14:02\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I gave you the place where the configurations are set  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I know  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea/tmortagne: ok to merge my fix for http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13276 in 7.4.3?  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the url format for webjars has changed  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but since we need it for http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CKEDITOR-53  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it's acceptable  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?
