(People will have issues with this even with the doc but at least it's better than nothing)  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: in that case we might want to have some migration to delete the solr directory?  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(should be an easy one to write)  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you mean use database migration to delete something in permdir ?  \n11:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: RN for 5.3RC1 is a work in progress, it will contain the right info in the end.  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: sure but having to delete the index before upgrading is not very nice  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: problem is that SOLR is started et running before that AFAIK  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm right\u2026  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we could have a distribution status based migration system executed at application startup  \n11:31\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I've also got this at the end of the migration: http://hastebin.com/pumavahipo.avrasm  \n11:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: it's not that difficult either, and it's not my focus currently.  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's your focus mflorea?  \n11:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Roadmaps/WebHome  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the 5 remaining issues?  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how long do you need before we can release RC? Or do you want to have them in a RC2 or final? (final is bit risky no?)  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: it's not much about being difficult but people will never think about it (yes I know it's in the RN but it's not in the upgrade documentation or anything like this), and yes it's not your fault but it still worth thinking about possible solutions  \n11:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: 4 actually, I moved XWIKI-9528 for later since we depend on Tika 1.5 release.

The race condition issue  \n13:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as I said this morning XE does not build automatically at all because of failing test in platform so you have to force it when you want a new one  \n13:39\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n13:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: 02-Dec-2013 13:43 is yesterday  \n13:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it's 1h before my commit  \n13:39\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I \u00a0see  \n13:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0please try to make sure what you are testing with since otherwise you are going to be annoyed for a long time...  \n13:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am already aannoyed  \n13:41\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: shouldn't I always get \"XWiki Enterprise - UI - Common\" when creating an old style subwiki ?
