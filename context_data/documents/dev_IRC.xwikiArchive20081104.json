I am Wang Ning. Remember me? I am one of gsocer in xwiki.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:35): daning: hey, nice to hear from you.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:35): :)  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:36): i'm working on the office-importer you developed for gsoc now :)  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:36): asiri: I have seen your refactor of office importer. It's really great.  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:36): asiri: Thanks for your work.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:37): oh .. thanks. :)  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:38): i'm bit stuck now with xwiki 2.0 rendering .. i mean tables run all over the place and such issues. But not sure where to handle them (in office-importer or parser) ..  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:38): asiri: I reviewed the new code and I think there may be some encoding issue when converting. Have you test the encoding part?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:39): danning: not really, what i did was simply use your code and moved them here and there so that it can be managed easily. I hope i haven't broke anything.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:39): anything missing ?  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:40): asiri: let see codes again.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:40): thanks a lot :)  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:46): asiri: Would you please run the xwiki with office import and test the conversion Chinese.doc to xwiki?  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:47): asiri: I don't have the envirenment to test it.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:47): danning: Oops, i tried this. I thought it was because i don't have the fonts i got the garbage content. I assume i'm wrong is it ? :)  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:48): asiri: You should set the encoding to utf-8 first.  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:48): asiri: I mean the attribute in xwiki.cfg  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:49): danning: ok, trying now.  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:50): asiri: Maybe should change the encoding info to utf-8 iin web.xml too.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:51): danning: ok, works fine now :)  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:52): danning: i only changed the encoding in xwiki.cfg  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:52): asiri: Great.   \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:52): does this mean i haven't missed anything ? :)  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:52): asiri: So the code is right. cheers.  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:52): asiri: Yes. You are right.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:52): danning: phew! thanks :)  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:53): asiri: \" i mean tables run all over the place and such issues. But not sure where to handle them (in office-importer or parser) \" what does that mean?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:54): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2804  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:54): danning: i can filter the html table and remove those <p> tags so that the table is rendered properly.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:54): but this is a hack ..  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:55): i think vincent won't allow this.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:55): same happened with lists.  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 13:55): asiri: it's not that I allow or not allow :)  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 13:55): iI don't allow anything  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:55): he he, true  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:55): asiri: The same thing happens in the <li> tags.  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 13:55): or disallow anything  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:55): yes yes, very true.  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 13:56): I just comment  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 13:56): we simply need to put things in the right location: xhtml parser, html cleaner or office importer  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 13:56): otherwise they won't be reused  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 13:56): asiri: Does the <li> work well now?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:57): not without the PinLiFilter ..  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:57): but this need to be handled in the parser not in the office-importer ..  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:57): because <p> tags inside <li> tags are legal xhtml content. In which case we need to allow it.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 13:58): and if we hack today, xhtml parser will not improve ;)  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:00): <p> in <td> is legal too, isn't it?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:00): daning: yes. http://learningforlife.fsu.edu/webmaster/references/xhtml/tags/table/td.cfm  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:01): I test the <p> in <td>. The html code both display well in firefox and IE.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:01): danning: True. But when rendered into xwiki 2.0 syntax, the result looks ugly.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:02): daning: that's what vincent is emphasizing that we need to handle those issues in the parser. Not workaround the problem.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:02): vmassol: hope i'm correct.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:05): daning: we can make office importer work fine simply by getting rid of those \"disturbing\" tags present in the html before passing into xhtml->xwiki 2.0 parser. But this is not correct.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:05): but some elements we still filter out, like <style> and <script>.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:07): daning: hope i didn't confuse too ..   \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:07): asiri: I don't think these <p> should be handled in html parser.  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:07): Because the <p> in <tb> is legal in xhtml.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:08): daning: by 'html parser' did you mean html->xwiki 2.0 parser ?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:08): i mean the conversion.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:09): danning: where so you think we must handle the <p> tags ?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:09): s/so/do  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:10): just so that it's clear, XWiki users can use the XHTML syntax in documents, same as they can use XWiki 1.0, XWiki 2.0, Confluence 1.0, etc  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:10): so any valid XHTML must work when people enter it as the page's content  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:10): (same for HTML)  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:11): vmassol: true, but when we convert the xhtml into xwiki 2.0, resulting document will not have any xhtml right ?  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:11): it can and it will  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:11): for all HTML elements that don't have an equivalent wiki syntax  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:12): in that case what we can do is use the xhtml macro for example  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:12): asiri: I think any valid xhtml should work with xwiki 2.0.  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:12): this is not decided yet  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:12): for the moment we'll probably just ignore the XHTML elements we don't handle  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:13): (like <FORM>, etc)  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:13): daning: true, but we convert the xhtml into xwiki 2.0 like it or not. so, as of today, no xhtml get's left behind. Either thay convert or die.  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:14): <p> in <tb> is valid xhtml. After conversion to xwiki 2.0, we got a empty line between | and real content. Xwiki 2.0 rendering will interpret this empty line as a new line. I think this should be improved.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:15): vmassol: how would you think we should handle cases like <p> tags inside <td> and <li> elements that doesn't translate into xwiki 2.0 very well.  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:16): i mean the resulting xwiki 2.0 tables and xwiki 2.0 lists are terrible :(  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:16): asiri: I thought you had filed a jira issue already?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:16): yes :)  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:16): so?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:16): just asking :P  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:16): I'm trying to catch up with your issues ;)  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:16): working on the newline one right now  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:17): I should be done in 15 minutes  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:17): vmassol: thanks :)  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:18): asiri: I think we have two place to handle the <p> in <li> and <tb>. first, the html->xwiki2.0 parser; second, the xwiki20rendering.  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:19): vmassol: You are trying to modify the xwiki20rendering now, right?  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:19): aha, true. I didn't think of the xwiki 2.0 rendering. But this might affect other stuff :(  \nasiri - (04/11/2008 14:19): not sure though.  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:20): daning: I'm working on http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2796  \ndaning - (04/11/2008 14:23): vmassol: I see.  \njvelociter - (04/11/2008 14:27): vmassol, still available today to talk about the macros ?  \nvmassol - (04/11/2008 14:27): jvelociter: hehe... I'd like to at least finish the bug I'm working on.
