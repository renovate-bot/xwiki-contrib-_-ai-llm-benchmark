I should mention that it is a custom mapped class I am refering  \nDenis - (15/09/2008 11:03): lucaa: are you talking about $obj.property is different than $obj.getProperty(\"property\").value ?  \nvmassol - (15/09/2008 11:18): lucaa: can we put bullets or something to spearate the different feeds on the home page of news.myxwiki.org.
