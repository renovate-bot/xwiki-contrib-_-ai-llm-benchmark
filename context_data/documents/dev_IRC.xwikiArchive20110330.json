What's your question?  \n12:15\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0fmancinelli: so can u just tell the main areas i have to look at  \n12:16\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0i have worked with the appengine before  \n12:16\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0i have to mainly understand the database stuctures right?  \n12:19\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0pulasthi: yes. the main problem here is to understand what are the limitation imposed by appengine and try to bypass them using a layer that allows xwiki to perform (most of) its queries on this infrastructure  \n12:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0something that came to my mind is how can we make queries nonblocking so that we can run multiple queries concurrently without using perhaps thousands of threads and connections.  \n12:20\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0yeah the api provided by the app engine is a little complex i have used a framework called objectifiy  \n12:20\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0when doing my project  \n12:21\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The other way is the form huge queries to load everything that is possible at the time but that is ugly.  \n12:21\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0\\*projects  \n12:21\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0pulasthi: we are already working on these topics at XWiki  \n12:22\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0fmancinelli : ahh so if im to do the project what will i have to learn first :)  \n12:22\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0pulasthi: so the gsoc project might focus on a particular aspect, because porting Xwiki to appengin is a huge project :)  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm really tempted that we switch to CDI (weld)\u2026. I'm going to research again the dynamic registration possibilities (using portable extensions). Even if it's only available in weld and not CDI, I think it would be worth it  \n12:23\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0pulasthi: I would say, Appengine (but you are already familiar with), then you should look at xwiki internals like its data model and API and above all how data is retrieved and queried  \n12:23\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ahh ok ill look into that  \n12:23\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0fmancinelli :thanks for the tip ill keep in touch  \n12:24\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0\u00a0cjdelisle: thanks for ur help as well  \n12:24\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0:)  \n12:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/store/XWikiHibernateStore.java  \n12:24\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0pulasthi: Ludovic also mentioned the query language in the project proposal.

 \n17:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Let me try to reproduce that  \n17:59\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0ok  \n18:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So:  \n18:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0- uncheck \"Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page or space rights\"  \n18:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0- forbid \"view\" for \"Unregistered users\"  \n18:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0- enable \"Use email verification\"  \n18:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Is that correct?  \n18:01\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0yes  \n18:01\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0The body of the email coming back for verification does not have a valid link  \n18:01\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0it looks like this: $xwiki.getDocument(\"XWiki.AccountValidation\").getExternalURL(\"view\", \"validkey=${validkey}&xwikiname=${xwikiname}\")  \n18:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, that can be fixed  \n18:03\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0Is it a bug, or just a config issue?  \n18:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Do you know where to edit the content of that mail?  \n18:03\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0yes  \n18:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Bug, but it shouldn't have worked before either  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Replace $xwiki.getDocument with $xwiki.getDocumentAsAuthor  \n18:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0See if it works after that  \n18:04\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0In only the validation email, or both validation and confirmation?  \n18:04\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Both  \n18:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Still, something else is wrong there  \n18:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'll debug it further  \n18:05\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0trying it now...  \n18:05\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0nope. \u00a0Didn't work.  \n18:06\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0still the same result  \n18:06\u00a0<Avipar>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:15\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0@sdumitriu: \u00a0You still there, I have more information  \n18:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0go ahead, maybe me or someone else will have an idea  \n18:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*I  \n18:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0woooooohoo attachment porting script is done.

By default the Registration page tries to defend itself against being given too much permission by dropping it.  \n18:34\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But the drop statement is like a sledgehammer because it effectively becomes authored by \"guest\" who is explicitly banned from your wiki.  \n18:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That line and $xwiki.getDocumentAsAuthor as Sergiu said should fix you.  \n18:35\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0trying it now...  \n18:38\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0What rights to I need to set for Guest?  \n18:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That should fix you so that you can prevent guest from viewing everything.  \n18:40\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0It didn't work  \n18:41\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0same verbage in the email  \n18:41\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0This email address was used to register a new account on ${wikiname}.

 \n18:43\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh.  \n18:43\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0no you should never need to cycle it unless you have changed a configuration file on the disk.  \n18:44\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0I just double-checked and the Verification and Confirmation code uses getDocumentAsAuthor  \n18:44\u00a0<kgeorge>\u00a0is there somewhere else that I need to be changing this?
