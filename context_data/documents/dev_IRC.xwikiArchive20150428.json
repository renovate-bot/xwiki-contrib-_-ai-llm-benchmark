i.e. if there is multinode environment and one client connects to first-server:8093 and second connects to second-server:8093  \n15:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it is not cluster aware  \n15:19\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0okay, i will make a little patch for it :)  \n15:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0And I will be ready to take your pull req, that sounds like a most interesting improvement! https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/xwiki-contrib-websocket  \n15:22\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup... i still have to think about the cluster modifications, but that has some security issues with my settings (one floating IP adress), so i will add just possibility to not-fail if address binding fails... then node with the correct IP adress will handle all requests, thus avoiding inconsistency and websocket.externalPath will ensure all clients connect to the correct server  \n15:25\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n15:50\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0cjd: don't you know, if i add websocket jar into lib folder, will it replace the extension-updater version?  \n15:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it will not, both will end up being loaded and it will be a mess  \n15:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but if you do a `find ./ -name '\\*websocket\\*jar' then replace that file, it will be ok  \n15:56\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0great, thanks... i wasn't sure how exactly does the EM work  \n16:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually it depends what the jar you put in lib forlder contains, if EM can identify it as extension with id \"extensionid\" it won't load any installed extension matching this id  \n16:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/forlder/folder/  \n16:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and it will warn about this conflict)  \n16:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(DarkKnightCZ )  \n16:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:12\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks  \n16:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now EM search for maven pom in jar it can find in the classloader to identify core extensions and for all the jar it could not identify it look at other jars dependencies  \n16:18\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:33\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:35\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0cjd: okay, so either NettyWebSocketService.userByKeyWiki creation has to be distributed across cluster, or the key generation has to be changed (i.e. with some strong cipher), otherwise users will get 401 from different nodes... i will try the cipher solution tomorrow as i'm worried the jgroups distribution won't be that fast  \n16:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: +1 re jgroups, perhaps it could be tested?
