Other options discussed all led to the \"invalid character\" error.  \n12:15\u00a0<helge>\u00a0Another thing: something strange is going on on your news site (http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News). Maybe someone is doing something nasty? You might want to check. Regards, Helge.  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0helge: what patch did you apply?  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you have a jira issue where this is mentioned so that I could follow it?  \n12:17\u00a0<helge>\u00a0vmassol: the one Dumitiu recommended:  \n12:17\u00a0<helge>\u00a0<@sdumitriu> helge: Can you try one more thing? Extract xwiki.hbm.xml from WEB-INF/lib/xwiki-platform-legacy-oldcore-\\*.jar into WEB-INF/classes and change the \"content\" property of the \"XWikiRCSNodeContent\" class from \"materialized\\_clob\" to \"text\", then restart the server. It won't work for the existing history, but try to create a new document  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Ok thanks, is there a jira issue about this problem?  \n12:18\u00a0<helge>\u00a0sorry, no jira issue, just IRC discussion  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be great if you could create one  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that we can fix it  \n12:19\u00a0<helge>\u00a0I'll do the next days, when I got time to.

Now I am running Windows + FF .. and all the attachments test fail because of the path generation. If we are able to fix this, and make our tests os independent, I can move to the next stage of runnning them on IE, Chrome, etc  \n14:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0IMO this is the best strategy, to fix the issues affecting windows ...  \n14:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0wdyt ?  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes good  \n15:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Tests run: 158, Failures: 12, Errors: 49, Skipped: 0  \n15:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0the list I will put on the JIRA is not 100% accurate.
