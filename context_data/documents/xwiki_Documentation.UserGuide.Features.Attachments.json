For example this is very useful for attaching images and displaying them in the page's content.\u00a0\n\n# Attaching a file\n\nThere are 3 possibilities to attach a file:\n\n## Using the top level menu\n\nYou can add an attachment using the \"More actions\" menu:\n\n![AddAttachmentsFlamingo.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/AddAttachmentsFlamingo.png?rev=1.6)\n\nWhen clicked, it'll direct you to the Attachments tab located at the bottom of the page:\n\n![view-attachments.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/view-attachments.png?rev=1.10)\n\n## Using the attachment tab at the bottom of the page\n\nView the page on which you wish to attach a file and then click on the \"Attachments\" tab at the bottom of the page.\n\n![attachments.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/attachments.png?rev=1.7)\n\nNote that the file selector that appears allows you to select as many files as you wish to upload. Thus you don't need to add attachments one by one.\n\nUse the arrows in the upper right corner to navigate to uploaded files.\n\n## Using the WYSIWYG editor\n\nEdit the page on which you wish to attach a file using the WYSIWYG editor. To link a specific text with an attachment click on \"Link\" in the toolbar. From the arrow change Page to Attachment or click on Upload to add a new file directly.\n\nTo add an image directly in the page click on \"Image\" and select an existing one from the wiki or click on Upload and add a new image from your computer.\n\n![AttachmentWysiwygToucan.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/AttachmentWysiwygToucan.png?rev=1.1)\n\n# Moving an attachment\n\nXWiki 14.0+ [![attachment_button.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/attachment_button.png?width=960&rev=1.2)](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/attachment_button.png?rev=1.2)A button is available in the attachments pane, allowing to move or rename an attachment. It is possible to change the name or the location of the attachments. Optionally, a redirection action is proposed, allowing to automatically redirect requests to the old location of an attachment to the new one.\n\n\n\nXWiki 14.2+ [![move_attachment_refactoring.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/move_attachment_refactoring.png?width=960&rev=1.1)](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/move_attachment_refactoring.png?rev=1.1)When moving an attachment, the pages using the moved attachment are automatically refactored to point to the new location of the attachment. Advanced users can deactivate this refactoring in the move attachment form.\n\n\n\n# Deleting an attachment\n\nAn attachment can be deleted by pressing the delete button that is shown only if the user has the specific rights for this. Also, a confirmation modal is provided for the action to be completed.\n\n![deleteAttachmentModal.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/deleteAttachmentModal.png?rev=1.1)\n\n# Linking to an attached file/image\n\nIf you're using the Wiki editor, you can use the [Wiki Syntax](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/) to display an image inline or link to an attachment.\n\nIf you're using the WYSIWYG editor, then use the \"Link\" or \"Image\" buttons as shown above.\n\n# Linking to an external file/image\n\nIf your file is on a remote server and you wish to link to it from your wiki, simply use the URL of the link as the content of your wiki link. For example, using the wiki editor you'd write:\n\n* **XWiki Syntax 1.0**: [http://some\\_remote\\_server/path/to/file>text to display]\n* **XWiki Syntax 2.0**: [[text to display>>http://some\\_remote\\_server/path/to/file]]\n\nFor displaying an image located on a remote server, use the following HTML code snippet:\n\n* **XWiki Syntax 1.0**: <img src=\"http://some\\_remote\\_server/path/to/image\"/>\n* **XWiki Syntax 2.0**: image:http://some\\_remote\\_server/path/to/image\n\nSee the [XWiki Syntax Guide](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/) for more details.\n\n# Backlinks indexation\n\nXWiki 14.2+ Page including attachments (or images) from other pages are now listed in their [backlinks](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Navigate/#HBacklinks).\n\n# Upload summary\n\nXWiki 16.3.0+\u00a0When upload summaries are enabled by the administrator, you can include descriptions to your uploads done through the Attachment tab.\n\n![upload-summary.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments/upload-summary.png?rev=1.1)\n\nThese upload summaries will then be displayed for each upload in the revision history of the attachment.  \nNote that if you upload multiple files at the same time with, *e.g.*, a drag and drop, they will share the same upload summary.\n\n\n\n# Size Limit\n\nThe maximum size of an attachment is limited by the administrator. By default it is set at about 32 megabytes.\n\n# Learn More\n\nFor more information about how XWiki attachments work and how to configure/tune the attachment store, you can examine the [administrator's guide to attachments](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Attachments).\n\n\n"}
