Is there a way for my JSON to return some error so that the underlying {{tree}} macro will report an error to the user?  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in my case it's a permission error that makes the json not return what it should and I'd like to tell the user about it  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should I create a node with the error as the node text? :)  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or is there a better way?  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(couldn't find error handling on http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Tree+Widget#HDynamicData)  \n09:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it depends where the tree macro fails. \"s there a way for my JSON to return some error\" --> this assumes that the error is in the JSON, but it can also be in the JavaScript code or in the Velocity code of the macro  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in my case I'd like to return some error from the JSON  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie from my json page)  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this json tries to get some attachment info but if the user doesn't have permissions returns an empty list now and the user will see something empty and will wonder what happened  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to return the exception that I get from the backend  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(where it says that the problem is a permission issue on such archive)  \n09:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0what you can do for now is to return a fake node that has the error message in its label  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that was my suggestion  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there's no specific error handling fro this in the tree ATM  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll create a jira issue as improvement for later on, ok?  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can i return HTML as the node lavel?  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*label  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(vmassol: looks like my test was getting an error as expected but not the right error so indeed there is an issue with allowed namespace validation)  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because a stack trace is pretty long and I'll need to have the node label clickable in the same way as we do for macro errros  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can also get the root cause for no  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*now  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm \u00a0it's hard actually\u2026  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no it's ok forget it, I just need to modify the NIOTool  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I disabled HTML in node label. You can enabled it for your tree but then you need to HTML-encode all the labels that are not supposed to have HTML (e.g. file names)  \n10:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you don't need to put all the info in the node label. You can put it in the node data, and then from JS you can listen when the tree is loaded and check if the tree has a single node with type \"error\" (that you previously set), and if that's the case you take the error info from the node data  \n10:05\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_9>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's probably a bit involved for me right now but it's a good idea, actually it could possibly even described and documented on that tree page on exo with an example ;)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0entering meeting  \n10:10\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hi, someone had working a little bit on font awesome? because I have a very strange bug on xwiki 7.0.1 I can't understand  \n10:10\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0If I use to display a tiny globe character with font awesome, I use this HTML code on a page: <span class=\"fa fa-globe\"></span> (between {{html}} tags but it didn't display globe icone ... except on welcome page of xwiki (in display gadget) ... but only if I'm logon with Admin user :-(  \n10:10\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0If someone have an idea where I can search a fix?
