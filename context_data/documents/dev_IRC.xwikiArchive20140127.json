So in my case it returns an array with a lot of \"Main.Welcome\" values  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would need to be converted to a XWQL query and use the language filter  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it already uses the query manager  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's easy to add this filter  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ATM it uses only the hidden filter  \n16:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I don't know if this is reported in JIRA, I'm sure this is an ancient issue  \n16:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but if not, I want to report it  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I'd report it if I were you  \n16:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: okay, reporting it  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's really easy to fix, only issue is to decide if we're ok to break the API or not  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie add a new API or not)  \n16:09\u00a0<mstaicu>\u00a0We could add a new method which takes a list as a first argument and a second parameter which is a boolean  \n16:10\u00a0<mstaicu>\u00a0Returning only the translations with the default language of the wiki  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's the new API option  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is the safest  \n16:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: when you don't find something report it, if someone knows the other one you did not found he will link it as duplicate  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a good issue to fix during the next BFD ;)  \n16:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, just wanted to create as less mess on jira as possible, this is why I asked :0  \n16:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you searched, it's already good ;)  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: would be great if we could release 5.4RC1 before Thursday so that all work for 5.x would continue on a branch and master would become 6.0-m1  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and BFD would happen on master by default)  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(a bit more work for those working on 5.x but at least it should be safer for the stabilization work)  \n16:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9938 reported  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks sburjan  \n16:22\u00a0<mstaicu>\u00a0about http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9938  \n16:22\u00a0<mstaicu>\u00a0Do you agree on adding on this line  \n16:22\u00a0<mstaicu>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-tag/xwiki-platform-tag-api/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/plugin/tag/TagQueryUtils.java#L178  \n16:23\u00a0<mstaicu>\u00a0The following addFilter(\"currentlanguage\") ?  \n16:23\u00a0<mstaicu>\u00a0If the boolean argument is true ( second argument for the new method )  \n16:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0could this cause not to show the document if it has the tag but no translation for the \"current language\", whatever it is?  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mstaicu: yes but in a new method as to not break the existing API  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only problem  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that from an api pov it's better to list only tags for the current language if nothing is specified and have a allTags boolean to list all tags  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this can be done with 2 new apis and a deprecation of the old api  \n16:43\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:51\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:52\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:06\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0anyone knows how to modify the security module in order to not giving the creator rights to user \"null\" ?
