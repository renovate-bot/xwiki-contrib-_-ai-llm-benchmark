I'm using the debian enterprise installer to install XWiki 5.1. Nearly everything is fine, but unicode is broken. This is because the mysql connection string made by the installer is wrong.  \n15:07\u00a0<andrewmcveigh|wo>\u00a0See https://www.refheap.com/19663  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0andrewmcveigh|wo: thanks, might be good to create a jira issue to report it so that we can fix it  \n15:08\u00a0<andrewmcveigh|wo>\u00a0OK, will do.  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0andrewmcveigh|wo: did you do an upgrade because as far as I can see the connection string is fine in http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-mysql-common/5.1/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-mysql-common-5.1.deb  \n15:14\u00a0<andrewmcveigh|wo>\u00a0tmortagne: No, brand new install.  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha wait  \n15:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you mean exactly by UTF8 is broken ? I can use UTF8 characters with a wiki with this configuration  \n15:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even if I agree that it ended up up after escape/unescape jingling  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/up/wrong/  \n15:18\u00a0<andrewmcveigh|wo>\u00a0Well, E.G., when using non-latin characters, they don't save to mysql correctly. The get saved as \"?\"  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0andrewmcveigh|wo: and jut changing this configuration fixed it ?  \n15:19\u00a0<andrewmcveigh|wo>\u00a0Yep. Deleting the extra amp; worked.  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:20\u00a0<andrewmcveigh|wo>\u00a0I have the same issue on 2 separate Ubuntu 12.04 LTS boxes. They're both fresh installs.  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok, \u00a0I see where to fix it  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would be great if you could create a jira issue  \n15:21\u00a0<andrewmcveigh|wo>\u00a0Yep, in the process...  \n15:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:32\u00a0<andrewmcveigh|wo>\u00a0OK, I added it to jira http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XE-1332 .
