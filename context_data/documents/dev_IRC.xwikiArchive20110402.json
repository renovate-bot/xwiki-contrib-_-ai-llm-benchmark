It just means that we need to get a contract telling us exactly what we have to implement before we start.  \n14:27\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0ahh  \n14:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0XWQL is \"leeky\" so you can sneak HQL past it. Since there is no spec ( D: ) we need someone to tell us what is needed and what we can skip.  \n14:29\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0i almost thought that XWQL is the same as HQL  \n14:30\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Ofc with any luck the community will see my point that XWQL is really just a toy and if we want to be taken seriously we need to use a real query language.  \n14:30\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0well we can right a layer to do the converstion if needed right  \n14:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Sure we can convert the broken idiom document.object(XWiki.SomeClass) into the correct format  \n14:32\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0hmm  \n14:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0However since HQL can be used in an XWQL query, being \"the same\" would mean rewriting hibernate which I am not doing without being paid upfront ;)  \n14:33\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0:)  \n14:34\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0so i want be that mach of a problem to leave it as it as  \n14:34\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0im mean since HQL can be used  \n14:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The problem is that HQL is part of hibernate and hibernate only runs on relational databases (not cassandra and not app engine)  \n14:35\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0btw i went though the bolg with the app engine incompatablity with JDO i also had some of those issues  \n14:36\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0hmm  \n14:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I noticed that google seems not to be that dedicated to supporting app engine.  \n14:37\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0ya some of the problems they seem to have just ignoerd  \n14:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0What problems did you experience?

 \n14:54\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0ya  \n14:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it would be wize to look carefully at google bigtable benefits and costs then in your proposal explain why it is inferior to cassandra.  \n14:55\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0ok  \n14:55\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0:)  \n14:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I am going to compare cassandra to Hbase, an object store, and a document store.  \n14:55\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0have u talked to the mentors about this  \n14:56\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0About which?
