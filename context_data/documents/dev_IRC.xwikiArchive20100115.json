I have a java server app of my own and would like to integrate xwiki and have no clue about those default plugin infrastructure, need to know which classes to initialise and such  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:48): I can try, What kind of server app do you have, a servlet?  \nforsake - (02:48): kind of, using http-components for some http parsing thats kind of it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:49): And you want XWiki to call your app and not the other way around am I right?  \nforsake - (02:50): yes, that could be great  \nforsake - (02:52): I have this idea of running xwiki as its own thread and forwarding any http requests to it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:53): Keep in mind that XWiki is multi threaded.  \nforsake - (02:53): I also would like to use a common user database, but no ldap  \nforsake - (02:53): multi threaded is ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:53): Perhaps you are looking for something like this? http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/DevGuide/API/xwiki-core-2.1.1-javadoc.jar/com/xpn/xwiki/api/XWiki.html#invokeServletAndReturnAsString(java.lang.String)  \nforsake - (02:54): that sounds good  \nforsake - (02:55): so I would instantiate com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki  \nforsake - (02:55): any tutorial pages I could look through?  \nforsake - (02:56): as to what classes need to be set and what to pay attention for?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:57): XWiki is already instantiated when the XWiki engine is running, here's some info about scripting: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:58): You can write Velocity code where the XWiki object is available as $xwiki  \nforsake - (02:58): oh ok, thx, but I kind of thought about running xwiki directly in my app  \nforsake - (02:59): so I need to startup the xwiki engine  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:59): Oh I see so your app calls XWiki.  \nforsake - (02:59): yes, thatd be great :)  \nforsake - (03:00): I dont want to run any jetty/tomcat or alike  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:02): I know people have gotten certain parts of XWiki (eg: the rendering engine) to work separate from the rest but I don't know of anyone running the entire engine without a servlet container (jetty, tomcat, etc.)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:03): Is there one particular function which you really want?  \nforsake - (03:03): my server app is supposed to be an alternative servlet container  \nforsake - (03:04): Im already running a framework for some other webservice, and have my own session per user which are distributed over several server farms  \nforsake - (03:05): so I have somewhat a user database of my own, which I would like to use via xwiki  \nforsake - (03:05): one login for all  \nforsake - (03:05): as such I wanted to run xwiki directly via my server app  \nforsake - (03:06): It would be great if I could use xwiki like redirecting xwiki requests to the xwiki engine and getting a response page which I could send back  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:06): I would say if your application is a faithful implementation of the java servlet container then XWiki should run. Getting it integrated with the other parts of your system sounds like it will require programming.  \nforsake - (03:07): thats kind of the problem, I dont have a real default servlet container  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:07): I know that most of the requests in xwiki are directed through a Struts servlet.  \nforsake - (03:08): the programming part would be no problem, but since Im new to xwiki I got no clue where to start of :)  \nforsake - (03:08): ok thx, checking struts api now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:08): I can give you the nickle tour :)  \nforsake - (03:10): thatd be wonderful :))  \nforsake - (03:10): Im checking http://struts.apache.org/1.1/faqs/works.html right now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:13): Struts calls various classes which extend XWikiAction http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/web/XWikiAction.java  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:14): Most notably the view action: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/web/ViewAction.java  \nforsake - (03:16): A quick question: if I implement the ActionServlet I could load up xwiki as a normal servlet web app, right? downloading the struts lib right now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:17): I think that would work, although you wouldn't have access to services which run through their own servlets notably webdav, xmlrpc and rest.  \nforsake - (03:18): hm, i see  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:18): Here is the web.xml file: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/web/trunk/standard/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml  \nforsake - (03:19): thanks a lot for everything! gonna try out a couple thinks and let you know / come for more questions :))  \nforsake - (03:19): things  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:20): No problem, if i'm not at the chat window, just say Caleb and I get a popup.  \nforsake - (03:22): aiighty, thanks  \nforsake left at 03:52 (\"Lost terminal\"  \nforsake joined #xwiki at 03:53  \nnpm left at 04:40 (\"Leaving.\"  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 05:10  \nforsake - (05:10): oh well, gonna try again tomorrow, login off for now, thanks again and good n8!  \nforsake - (05:11): night  \nforsake left at 05:11 (\"leaving\"  \nnpm left at 05:24 (Remote closed the connection  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 06:38  \nnpm left at 06:41 (Client Quit  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 06:45  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:03): [vmassol] wow  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:03): [vmassol] I got all past messages since my last connection!  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:03): [vmassol] that means this new jabber client is just awesome  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:03): [vmassol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:04): [vmassol] I disconnected at 23:38 yesterday and now I see messages that were sent at 3:18 this morning by forsake and Caleb!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl left at 09:10 (verne.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nLukemon left at 09:10 (verne.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nnpm left at 09:10 (verne.freenode.net irc.freenode.net  \nxwiki-bridge left at 09:10 (  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 09:11  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 09:11  \nCalebJamesDeLisl joined #xwiki at 09:11  \nLukemon joined #xwiki at 09:11  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:18): [vmassol] Caleb: good morning, very neat  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:18): [vmassol] I thought only the last hour was saved or so  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:18): [vmassol] but apparently it was my previous clients not working well  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:18): [vmassol] (unless some settings changed on conference.jabber.org)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:19): What client are you using?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [vmassol] psi  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [vmassol] psi-im.org/  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [vmassol] Caleb: re jcaptcha I got a twet back:  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [vmassol] a direct one:  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:20): Cool, what did he have to say?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [vmassol] \"yes stable, juste abandonne le support jdk3, non ps mv rep. je gere ca demain. beaucoup plus lisible. prod ready.\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [vmassol] translation: it's stable, there's no maven repo yet but he's handling that today. More readable code and production ready code.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [vmassol] we'll have more details today  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:21): I could understand most of the French version even not knowing any French.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:22): I'm making an email out to the dev list about my proposed module.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:22): [vmassol] ok great  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:23): The only thing I dislike is that it will not work with the portlet and needs to use the if( instanceof servlet) {cast} hack.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [vmassol] about the action module?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [vmassol] or about the captcha stuff?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:25): ImageToJpegHelper and SoundToWavHelper demand access to the HttpServlet (for access from ActionManager)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:25): [vmassol] re environments we have started the xwiki-container/ module with the goal of isolation our code from the environment xwiki is urnning in  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:25): [vmassol] the action module should definitely not depend on the running environment  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:25): Oh I just made the captcha components support the old struts implementation and the unfinished Action implementation.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:25): [vmassol] however some very specific actions could possibly depend on it I guess  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [vmassol] even though we should try to avoid that too  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:26): I think the generic request, response and session are going to need more methods added.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [vmassol] sure  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [vmassol] I only put the bare minimum to get started  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [vmassol] OTOH it should not become too crowded either  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [vmassol] for environment specific stuff we should be able to get the original container objec  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:28): [vmassol] object  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:28): So you consider the if instanceof cast trick okay?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:28): [vmassol] I don't know. Looks a problem at first glance but would need to see more  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:28): [vmassol] I mean it's definitely wrong  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [vmassol] but I don't know if there are solutions before I see what it's doing  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [vmassol] maybe it's the underlying frameworks that are too environment specific, maybe we need to have different impls for different envs, etc  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:30): I needed the session id to get the captcha solution in cases where the captcha was gotten through the old struts based system so I needed the HttpServlet  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:30): As an example.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [vmassol] yes but for exmaple it's possible that jcaptcha allows you to control where the id is saved in which case we would save it in our generic Session object (in the future)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [vmassol] anyway don't worry too much  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [vmassol] I'm just trying to imagine the future  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [vmassol] but we need this working now :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:38): Are you aware that {{html}} macros on a page which is pulled in by #includeInContext are stripped and the html is then parsed as wiki text?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:43): [vmassol] Caleb: looks like a bug, could you send a mail on the list to verify the behavior? Thomas should know more  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:45): Will do. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something normal. I think the content is being parsed twice.  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 09:45  \nLukemon\\_ joined #xwiki at 09:49  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 09:56  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 10:02  \n\\_Lukemon\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:03  \nLukemon left at 10:03 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:12): [vmassol] ouch just got a memory error on the XE I left running from yesterday night:  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:12): [vmassol] Exception in thread \"http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Title\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:12): [vmassol] Exception in thread \"http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space  \nLukemon\\_ left at 10:15 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:17): [vmassol] tmortagne: hi.

It could also be the jdk I'm using  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:40): [vmassol] s/code/code macro/  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:41): [tmortagne] maybe, would be hard to make sure, do you have the issue with http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb/2.2-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-2.2-20100114.213425-151.zip sos that others mac users could download it and try  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:41): [tmortagne] ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:43): [vmassol] downloading  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:47): [evalica] does anyone know what is the template for the Comments, Attachments, ... tabs?  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:49): [evalica] docextra.vm - thanks  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:54): [tmortagne] vmassol: by \" ok the pb is on \" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0this.pythonInterpreter = new PythonInterpreter();\"\" do you mean that this line is very slow or that you get the error here ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:54): [tmortagne] (slow is normal, jython init takes a long time (between 5 and 10 seconds) the first time code macro is called)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:54): [vmassol] tmortagne: it's slow as in it never gets out of it and after 1 minute I get OOM exceptions in the log and the JVM is dead and I have to kill -9 it  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:55): [tmortagne] ok then yes it's not normal  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:57): [vmassol] tmortagne: btw the version you had me downlaod is buggy  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:57): [vmassol] I cannot create a new page with it  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:58): [vmassol] actually I can't even save an existing page  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:58): [tmortagne] well that's the last hudson build, i did not tryed it  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:58): [vmassol] so I cannot try the code macro  \nxwiki-bridge left at 11:02 (  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 11:04  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 11:32  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 11:32  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:43): [lucaa] hi vmassol  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:46): [vmassol] lucaa: hi  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:46): [lucaa] I would like your opinion on object properties references, I sent a mail the other day. I would need to implement that starting monday and I still need to decide some things  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:46): [lucaa] and also  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:46): [vmassol] ok,I'll reply today  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:47): [lucaa] thanks  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:47): [lucaa] what would be the procedure if I wanted to have jira issues reported on annotations even if no version was released yet?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:47): [vmassol] (but it's not just me, the syntax will need to be voted)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:47): [vmassol] lucaa:   \nxwiki-bridge - (11:48): [vmassol] the normal procedure is to comment in the issue that exist  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:48): [lucaa] yes, that's it, I would like an \\_opinion\\_ not a \\_vote\\_ (read help)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:48): [lucaa] vmassol: but the issue doesn't exist, because no issue can be created until the first version is released  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [vmassol] errr?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [lucaa] we create an issue saying that a version should be released?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [vmassol] what?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [vmassol] we always always create an issue when there's something to be done  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [vmassol] in this case it's about developing the annotation feature  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [vmassol] a frist version of it  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [vmassol] so you must have an issue about this  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [vmassol] describing what the first version will contain  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:50): [vmassol] IDD = issue driven development  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:50): [vmassol] same as TDD  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:50): [vmassol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:51): [vmassol] you start by creating an issue normally. In practice we often do it just before commit but ideally it's better to do it as early as possible to let people know about it  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:52): [vmassol] is that ok?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:52): [vmassol] (ok as in clear)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:52): [lucaa] yes, I normally understand  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:52): [lucaa] except that it doesn't help too much  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:52): [vmassol] why?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:52): [lucaa] there is a component in the XCONTRIB called 'Annotations'  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:52): [vmassol] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:53): [lucaa] what I should do now is create an issue in it saying \"create first version of the annotations\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:53): [lucaa] and then everything I have / find report under that?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:53): [vmassol] yes. You can also simply say \"Add Annotation feature\" and describe what it contains in the descrition  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:53): [lucaa] my pb is that there are a lot of problems in various areas  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:54): [vmassol] yes so that's why  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:54): [lucaa] and one issue can get very long  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:54): [vmassol] we also usually  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:54): [vmassol] have several first issues, one per feature for ex  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:54): [vmassol] when we have large stuff like annotations  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [vmassol] this is fine too since the release notes will be fine (even better than a single issue actually in this case)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [tmortagne] lucaa: you can use sub-tasks  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [vmassol] subtasks will work too  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [lucaa] tmortagne: yes, I just thought about this  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [vmassol] I don't like them  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [vmassol] but they'll kind of work  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [lucaa] vmassol: why?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [vmassol] the reaosn I don't like is this one:  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [vmassol] you won't be able to close the top level task till all the subtakss are done  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [lucaa] you can refactor  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [lucaa] as in pull them ut  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [vmassol] so when you do time boxing (as we use to do)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [lucaa] out  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [vmassol] yes and you're lucky since that feature as introduced only recently in jira ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [vmassol] s/as/was/  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [lucaa] leave them to the next version (since now they can have a \"affects\" since a version will be released)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [vmassol] and we have it in our version  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [lucaa] that means that you're not oposing by principle but by limitations of the bugtracker :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:57): [vmassol] but having several issues without subtasks is good too  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:57): [vmassol] (it's my prefernce but YMMV)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:57): [vmassol] (and as I said subtaks are fine too provided you close the top level task when the frist release is done)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:57): [vmassol] lucaa: I only care about one thing  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:58): [lucaa] shoot  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:58): [vmassol] that the release notes match the reality from a user POV  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:58): [lucaa] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:58): [vmassol] that's always my guiding principle for jira usage  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:59): [vmassol] (and seeing a bug fix for something not released is not user-friendly IMO)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:59): [vmassol] but it's not a big deal :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:00): [glerouge] lucaa: if this is any comfort I'm pretty sure I made the mistake countless times in the past ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:01): [lucaa] glerouge: what mistake?

 \nxwiki-bridge - (12:36): [lucaa] because it would automatically mock everything  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:36): [vmassol] it's for unit testing components yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:36): [vmassol] what we should be doing anyway  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:36): [lucaa] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:36): [vmassol] I do't think we need integration tests for components but we do need functional tests for sure  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:36): [vmassol] s/do't/don't/  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:37): [lucaa] I mean something like the renderer tests  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:37): [lucaa] I call that integration now, not functional  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:37): [vmassol] ah yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [lucaa] I'd say we add this, which is very cool, but also leave the old one for one to be able to extend from whichever he needs  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [vmassol] sure  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [vmassol] I'm not planning to remove anything   \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [lucaa] ah, k  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [vmassol] but  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [vmassol] always a but :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [vmassol] I'd recommend using this one as much as possible  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:38): [lucaa] single t happily  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:39): [lucaa] yes, I know  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:39): [lucaa] I mean using the other one should be \"knowing what you're doing\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:39): [vmassol] ok cleaning up and commiting  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:42): [vmassol] tmortagne:   \nxwiki-bridge - (12:42): [tmortagne] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:42): [vmassol] the code macro is working for me too in the link you gave me  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:43): [vmassol] I don't undestand  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:43): [tmortagne] ok, weird  \nxwiki-bridge - (12:43): [tmortagne] did you tried only in debug mode (when it failed) ?

I'm setting up an XE debug project in Eclipse and have already fixed the pom versions for <platform.plugin.applicationmanager.version> from 1.1-SNAPSHOT to 1.2-SNAPSHOT and <platform.plugin.wikimanager.version> from 1.16-SNAPSHOT to 1.17-SNAPSHOT, but that leaves me with an unresolved dependency to smartgwt 1.2.  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:54): [lucaa] Eduard Moraru: are you trying to test a running xwiki? if so, my advice is to do remote debugging, it's saves all the dependency mess  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:54): [lucaa] this one and any potential future one  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:56): [lucaa] as for com.smartgwt:smartgwt:jar:1.2 , isn't it in your local maven repo?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:56): [Eduard Moraru] I`m getting a NPE: org.xwiki.rest.Utils.getXWikiContext(Utils.java:170) \u00a0while trying to access a REST extension that I just did and I`m having the impression that maybe i`m running on old code with my XE ( xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-2.2-20100107.232235-137.zip )  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 14:57  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:57): [tmortagne] [release] Starting the release note, it will give me idea of things to test  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:57): [Eduard Moraru] other REST extensions (like the annotations one) work fine  \nplunden left #xwiki at 14:58  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:59): [Eduard Moraru] with this at the top of the exception trace:  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:59): [Eduard Moraru] org.restlet.ext.jaxrs.InstantiateException: org.xwiki.component.manager.ComponentLookupException: Failed to lookup component [role = [org.xwiki.rest.XWikiRestComponent] hint = [org.xwiki.rest.internal.PlaintextPageRESTService]] \u00a0  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:59): [Eduard Moraru] maybe I`m forgetting something...  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:59): [lucaa] I think I saw some commits on rest these days but I'm not sure. Can you try with a newer snapshot?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:00): [Eduard Moraru] yes... I was trying to avoid re-downloading the whole thing... but I`ll do it anyway. Might be faster after all.  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:00): [Eduard Moraru] thanks  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:03): [tmortagne] everyone: please close issues that has been committed for this release  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:06): [lucaa] vmassol: re object references mail, can you explain a bit what multivalues means/  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:06): [lucaa] ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:07): [vmassol] lucaa: maybe the term is wrong. I just mean multiple values for the same name  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:08): [lucaa] and why do we need that?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:09): [vmassol] object[number]  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:09): [vmassol] unless we decide we want to name objects  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:11): [lucaa] well, the way I see this reference is something like  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:11): [lucaa] EntityReference(type=property, name=\"myprop\") with parent EntityReference(type = object, name=\"number\") with parent EntityReference(type = class, name=\"myclass\") with parent DocumentReference (the page space wiki)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:11): [lucaa] am I understanding things wrong?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [vmassol] so you're seeing objects as children of classes  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [lucaa] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [vmassol] hmm  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [lucaa] and props as children of objects  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [vmassol] yes for props it's fine  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [vmassol] jsut wonderingfor objects  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [lucaa] and we could have name or number for object, it shouldn't matter  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [vmassol] a number as a name also isn't good  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [vmassol] I don't like it  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [vmassol] because  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:13): [tmortagne] class as childre of document is not right when it's not the document where the class is  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:14): [vmassol] yes that's one point  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:14): [tmortagne] we dont have a class here we have an object  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:14): [vmassol] but also in teh api we would use integer for numbers  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:14): [vmassol] and here you're using strings  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:15): [lucaa] is this parent child relation supposed to be semantic from all povs or only references to address things  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:15): [lucaa] ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:15): [vmassol] and so far any name is supposed to be valid  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:15): [vmassol] that would impose restrictions so that the name can only be a string representing a number  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:15): [vmassol] it looks like a hack to me  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:16): [vmassol] (ie trying to fit this in the current reference model)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [vmassol] the other solution it so thave \"myclass[number]\" as the name returned and then it's up to   \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [vmassol] an object parser to separate class from number  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [lucaa] but but but  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [vmassol] since \"myclass[number]\" is indeed the name  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [lucaa] this means you'll need an additional parser to parse object names generated from class & number  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [vmassol] so either we support multivalues in the reference package or we don't and then we have a separate parser  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [lucaa] and additional types to handle this, entity ref wouldn't be all  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [lucaa] wait  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [vmassol] multivalues is a bad name btw  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [lucaa] I still don't understand the multivalues  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [vmassol] ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [vmassol] vector names maybe is better  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [lucaa] using myclass[number] as object name would be smth like  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [lucaa] EntityReference(type=property, name=\"myprop\") with parent EntityReference(type = object, name=\"myclass[number]\") with parent DocumentReference (the page space wiki)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [lucaa] right/.  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [lucaa] ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:20): [vmassol] yes if it's NOT supported in the reference package  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [vmassol] otherwise it would be:  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [vmassol] EntityReference(type = object, name=\"myclass\", position=5)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [vmassol] well  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [lucaa] but...  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [vmassol] s/EntityReference/IndexedEntityRefernce/ or something like that  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [lucaa] what would be another usecase of this ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [lucaa] I can't generalize this...  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [lucaa] (in my head)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [vmassol] it's easy to generalize  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [vmassol] take XPath  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] and you have a generlization  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] in xpath you can have  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] a/b/c  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [lucaa] I understand  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] or a/b[3]/c  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [lucaa] I know xpath  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [lucaa] but that would mean that myclass is the child of docref, and it's the 5th child of the docref  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [vmassol] yes that's what the number is, isn't it?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [lucaa] meaning that the myclass name for the object is forced  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [lucaa] as it is not the name of the obj, but the name of its class  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [vmassol] name of object = name of class, no?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [lucaa] no  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [vmassol] that's how I view it  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [lucaa] name of class is the name of the type of obj  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:25): [vmassol] when you go in the object editor  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:25): [lucaa] it says objects of type iirc, doesn't it?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:26): [vmassol] it says both  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:26): [vmassol] it says \"TagClass 0\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:26): [lucaa] yes, which means name built from type + index  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:26): [vmassol] tmortagne: blocking issue  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:26): [lucaa] as in   \nxwiki-bridge - (15:26): [lucaa] myclass[number] as name  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:27): [vmassol] tmortagne: try editing a tag object in a doc  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:27): [vmassol] I think silviar just reported this  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:27): [tmortagne] vmassol: trying  \nCalebJamesDeLisl left at 15:28 (  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:28): [tmortagne] what is the issue ?

 \nxwiki-bridge - (15:47): [tmortagne] \"store as real list in the database\" ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:48): [sdumitriu] Yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:48): [tmortagne] ok another thing lost  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:48): [sdumitriu] If false, all values will be put in a concatenated string  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:48): [tmortagne] it's disabled now and it used to be enabled  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:48): [sdumitriu] If true, each selected value will be a separate entry  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:49): [sdumitriu] Upside of relational is easy query and larger lists  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:49): [sdumitriu] Downside is performance  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:50): [vmassol] starting a conf call, be available again in 1 hour   \nxwiki-bridge - (15:51): [tmortagne] should it be enabled by default ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:51): [tmortagne] user that case about performance will look at it closely but basic user will not understand why he can't add one more element in the list  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:52): [tmortagne] case=care  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:52): [tmortagne] nice name :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:53): [tmortagne] prepare for spam cleaning  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:53): [glerouge] lol  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:53): [lucaa] http://xkcd.com/327/  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:00): [tmortagne] fixed, continuing release note  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:47): [tmortagne] any idea of something to put in the \"Migration Notes\" section ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:48): [tmortagne] starting the maven release now  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:04): [vmassol] back  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:05): [vmassol] tmortagne: one thing for migration note  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:05): [vmassol] we don't support the \"wiki:page\" syntax anymore  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:06): [vmassol] so if you are using this notation in some docs the user will need to fix them  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:06): [vmassol] I'll check the release notes later today  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:06): [tmortagne] I already put it there  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:07): [tmortagne] I also talked about escaping and the fact that sometime you can get document name containing a \\, i also need to indicate that \\ need to be doubled  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:08): [vmassol] yes just seen it  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:08): [vmassol] we need to change the wording a bit I think since this is not usable yet  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:08): [vmassol] (work in progress)  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:09): [tmortagne] i need to re read the whole thing, it's just datas right now  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:10): [vmassol] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:11): [vmassol] btw we should try running 2.2M1 on myxwiki.org when it's released to test it further (both wiki macros and references need to be tested more)  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:13): [tmortagne] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:14): [tmortagne] i will upgrade myxwiki.org Tuesday (don't have time before)  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:15): [vmassol] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:15): [sdumitriu] By the way, I still don't have access to the myxwiki server  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:18): [tmortagne] sdumitriu: with your myxwiki.org farm user ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:19): [sdumitriu] No, on the linux server   \nxwiki-bridge - (17:19): [tmortagne] ho  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:20): [lucaa] sdumitriu: talk to salecss, they changed the vserver or something recently  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:21): [tmortagne] hmm, i can't either it seems  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:39): [NielsMayer] howcome this nearly one year old major bug never gets fixed: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-376 ... one that routinely causes problems still  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:55): [NielsMayer] re http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-376 -- doesn't 2.2M1's parser/serializer for docnames handle odd chars ('.') in the space or name by escaping? (per http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise22M1#HMigrationNotes ) . What prevents same escaping from handling '\"' in doc or space name?  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:15): [vmassol] NielsMayer: yes it does  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:16): [vmassol] NielsMayer: the problem is that we need to replace all places in the code where parsing/serialization was done with the new classes  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:16): [vmassol] this means for ex the places where we have: space + \".\" + name  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:16): [vmassol] I have started this already  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:16): [vmassol] and I hope I'll be able to finish it for 2.2 final but there's no guarantee since there are lots of places  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:16): [vmassol] by lots I mean hundreds  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:18): [vmassol] the new parser/serializer supports all chars in references, there's no limitation  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:18): [vmassol] title is something else though since it's not a reference (unless by title you mean document's name/reference)  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:29): [tmortagne] NielsMayer: XE-376 <http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-376> has nothing to do with references  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:03): \\* sdumitriu has set the subject to: XWiki Chat - http://www.xwiki.org/  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:10 (\"gone for food\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:13): [tmortagne] [release] jira, svn and maven release finished  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:13): [tmortagne] [release] Starting OW2  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:40): [NielsMayer] tmortagne, vmassol -- yes xe376 has nothign to do w/ references... now that i've had my coffee i can see this ... sorry.  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:44): [NielsMayer] seems like the bottom line w/ xe376 is that a \" or a ' , unescaped, will potentially cause all sorts of parse failures wherever the title is passed around as a string... since 'this is a \"quoted\"' will end up inside \"...\" and parse as  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:44): [NielsMayer] \"this is a \"quoted\"\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:47): [Eduard Moraru] Does anyone have any idea to why component-overrides.txt would fail to work?  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:48): [Eduard Moraru] I implemented the component's interface, added the @Component annotation and the META-INF/component-overrides.txt with the full java class name but XWiki still uses the old default component implementation, ignoring mine.  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [vmassol] Eduard Moraru: should work fine normally  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [Eduard Moraru] well, I dumped my jar into libs but it gets ignored  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [vmassol] one reason could be that the jar where the component-overrides.txt is isn't in the CP  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [tmortagne] Eduard Moraru: did you set up component-overrides.txt and component.txt \u00a0?  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [vmassol] libs = WEB-INF/lib?  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [Eduard Moraru] vmassol: yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [Eduard Moraru] tmortagne: do both have to be set up?  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [tmortagne] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [Eduard Moraru] ok, that must be it  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [Eduard Moraru] thanks, trying it out. (I have set up only overrides)  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:52): [tmortagne] component.txt register components and component-overrides.txt just indicate which one are forced overrides  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:52): [vmassol] Eduard Moraru: overrides are not require if you have only 1 impl :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:52): [vmassol] it's only for...well...overrides  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:52): [Eduard Moraru] I know, but I really want to override an existing implementation :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [vmassol] so you only need it in oveerrides  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:57): [vmassol] Eduard Moraru: if you want to see how it works, you can check ComponentAnnotationLoader.initialize()  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:57): [vmassol] it's pretty simple  \nsunny\\_slls joined #xwiki at 20:57  \nsunny\\_slls left at 20:58 (Client Quit  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:58): [Eduard Moraru] yes, I was just with the task of overriding an implementation and thought that the components-override.txt would be enough :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:58): [Eduard Moraru] It's working now, thanks  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [vmassol] but it is enoug  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [vmassol] enough  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [vmassol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [vmassol] you shudn't have it in boh  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [Eduard Moraru] well... it didn't work without having both   \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [Eduard Moraru] as Thomas pointed out  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:00): [vmassol] yes but that's just luck  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:00): [vmassol] it'll depend on the order of the jars  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:00): [vmassol] and you don't want this  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:01): [vmassol] since you're overriding sometihng that already exists  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:01): [vmassol] there's already a components.txt   \nxwiki-bridge - (21:01): [vmassol] hmmmm  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:02): [vmassol] checling something  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:03): [vmassol] Eduard Moraru: forget what I said, thomas is right :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:03): [Eduard Moraru] yes, I was looking at the code now too :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:03): [vmassol] I had a momeenty lapse  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:03): [vmassol] momentary  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:05): [vmassol] tmortagne: there are still some deps pointing to 2.2M1 I think on trunk, tryingto find them  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:06): [tmortagne] vmassol: ye sit's normal  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:06): [tmortagne] i did not cleaned after release yet  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:06): [tmortagne] taht's what i'm doing right now  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:06): [vmassol] ok, ping me when you're done since I need to rebuild  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:11): [Eduard Moraru] I added a note specifying the overrides detail in http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/ComponentModule#HOverrides  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:12): [vmassol] I was wonderig who that enygma was.... thanks eduard  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:12): [vmassol] yes our bot told us :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:13): [Eduard Moraru] oh, right :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:16): [tmortagne] vmassol: re versions: done for trunk  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:22): [vmassol] tmortagne: ok rebuilding thanks  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:24): [vmassol] tmortagne: it's not builind at all  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:24): [tmortagne] what is the issue ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:25): [vmassol] [ERROR] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-resolvable parent POM org.xwiki.platform.skins:xwiki-skins:20-SNAPSHOT for org.xwiki.platform.skins:xwiki-skin-colibri:1.10-SNAPSHOT: Failed to resolve POM for org.xwiki.platform.skins:xwiki-skins:20-SNAPSHOT due to Missing:  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:25): [vmassol] ----------  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:25): [vmassol] 1) org.xwiki.platform.skins:xwiki-skins:pom:20-SNAPSHOT  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:25): [tmortagne] i put back the wrong skins version sorry  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:25): [tmortagne] fixing that  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:26): [tmortagne] done  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:32): [vmassol] thx, it's building  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:33): [tmortagne] you really need to build skins ? :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:33): [vmassol] I build all  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:34): [tmortagne] i can't remember last time i built whole platform  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:50): [vmassol] tmortagne: enterprise doesn't build too  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:50): [vmassol] fixing  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:51): [tmortagne] ok thanks  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:56): [vmassol] tmortagne: fixed.
