It appears when I attempt to Update when on the OpenOffice Server page. It does not appear to be very informative as to what corrective action should be taken...  \n01:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0if you click on it (and have javascript enabled) it should expand and tell you what happened.  \n01:47\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Okay. Will check.  \n01:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But if you didn't write it then basicly what it means is \"we messed up\"  \n01:48\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Nope, nothing shows when I click.  \n01:48\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I'm trying to get the OpenOffice (well LibreOffice) running. I might not have everything right but I'd hoped it would tell me something useful if I did not.  \n01:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0You click in the words \"Failed to execute the [velocity] macro\" and it doesn't expand?  \n01:49\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Got a few minutes before dinner... well take that back. Dinner call just came! Check back later if the hurricane doesn't take down power.  \n01:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0heh  \n01:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ok  \n01:49\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Yes, clicked and nothing. It highlights the word I click on.  \n01:49\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Back later.  \n01:50\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok, if you run noscript (like me) then make sure javascript is allowed because it required js (when you get back ofc)  \n02:16\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n02:17\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0has quit  \n02:37\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay. back from dinner  \n02:38\u00a0<amon>\u00a0where do you enable js? config edit in /var/..../xwiki.properties or from Administration?  \n02:45\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0if you don't know about enabling javascript then it should already be working.  \n02:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Just some of us are security paranoid and the like and we want most websites to not be allowed to run js so I use a firefox addon called noscript when prevents it unless I explicitly give a website permission to run it.  \n02:47\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0what web browser are you using?  \n02:54\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Firefox  \n02:54\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Ah, so you mean the browser config. I will check that  \n02:55\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0No, if you normally see websites correctly then you have javascript enabled.  \n02:56\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Yeah, no particular problems, although I do keep the feature enabled that lets me accept/deny each cookie that someone tries to send. That should not effect anything here though.  \n02:57\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It shouldn't. Still that message should be expanding, would you care to post a screenshot or pastebin the page source? I would like to understand why it is not working for you.  \n03:01\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Interesting note: I do get a change of pointer to fingertip from arrow when I mouseover, but nothing comes up.  \n03:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0And I got \"Read technical information related to this error\", but clicking brings nothing further up.  \n03:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I have the screen shots. Send me an email and I'll attach the shots  \n03:04\u00a0<amon>\u00a0And the source htm dump  \n03:04\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0you can paste the html on pastebin.com and you can upload screenshots to bayimg.com unless you want to keep it private  \n03:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0if you want to email we can do that too  \n03:05\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Prefer to keep it private since this is an internal corporate site for a start up tech venture.  \n03:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0sure  \n03:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0get it?  \n03:07\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay, on the way  \n03:09\u00a0<amon>\u00a0While you look at it I am going to check out some of the usual Firefox problems and see if it is an issue there rather than XWiki  \n03:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0looks like you got the wrong html dump, I wanted the one where it was showing the error message.  \n03:13\u00a0<amon>\u00a0hmmm. let me check again. Maybe i sent the wrong one.  \n03:26\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I will have it in a moment. For some reason when I save it gives something different than what is in the source window. It does not include the error. Strange. But I got it via select all and cut and paste.  \n03:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ctrl\\_u  \n03:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*ctrl+u  \n03:30\u00a0<amon>\u00a0You should have the file now or soon  \n03:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0oh btw you do cool projects ;)  \n03:32\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Well, if we get one \u00a0of the NASA SBIR's we do! Not talking a lot about what we're up to but we're a pretty space-y lot ;-)  \n03:34\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n03:34\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0heh, this chan is logged so don't say non-public stuff  \n03:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ok the 2 directories which are specified in the page, those both have to exist and according to the error message, it looks like one of them doesn't.  \n03:35\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n03:36\u00a0<amon>\u00a0ah, is that the tomcat6 one?  \n03:36\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I'm pretty sure the other one does exist so it must be.  \n03:40\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Okay. this path does not exist, but it is what xwiki thinks is the default for this environment:  \n03:40\u00a0<amon>\u00a0#-# Path to openoffice execution profile (serverType:0 only).  \n03:40\u00a0<amon>\u00a0#-# If no path is provided, a default value will be calculated based on the operating environment.  \n03:40\u00a0<amon>\u00a0# openoffice.profilePath=/home/user/.openoffice.org/3  \n03:40\u00a0<amon>\u00a0So any idea what it \\*should\\* be in an Ubuntu natty? Or should I just go ahead and create a directory? Hmmm. I should see if there is a libreoffice directory near that name  \n03:41\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0IIRC you need to create the directory and copy some files into it, let me check...  \n03:41\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Nope. nothing libre near there  \n03:41\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay.  \n03:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I have /home/user/.openoffice.org2/user/3/  \n03:43\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Are you on an Ubuntu or Debian dist?  \n03:43\u00a0<amon>\u00a0That sounds more redhat or Suse-ish  \n03:45\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm using debian lenny  \n03:47\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay. is there anything in it that wasn't dynamically created? Otherwise I can just try creating the directory it expects and see what happens  \n03:49\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yup, that was my experience, I had to create the directories then once they were there, everything worked.  \n03:49\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay. Doing that now.  \n03:52\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Still same error. Directory exists now:  \n03:52\u00a0<amon>\u00a0drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 2011-08-27 20:51 /usr/share/tomcat6/.openoffice.org/3  \n03:53\u00a0<amon>\u00a0which is what it seemed to be looking for as the Ubuntu default  \n03:53\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Should tomcat6 be restarted? Different ownership?  \n03:54\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't think you need to reatert tomcat.  \n03:54\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It's too bad you can't see the content of the error, there's something else going on.  \n03:54\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Would it be logged in /var/log somewhere?  \n03:54\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes, the catalina.out file should have it.  \n03:55\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I'll check there  \n03:57\u00a0<amon>\u00a0nope. Did a tail -f on it and reran the Update from the window and nothing happened.  \n03:59\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Just to be sure of things, I am going to set the value in the xwiki.properties explicitely and restart everything.  \n04:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay. No change even with the /usr/share path explicit and a full reboot of the VM.  \n04:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0you can view source and you'll see thw error message which should be displayed when you click on the error tab  \n04:08\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay, will try that.  \n04:12\u00a0<amon>\u00a0All I see in the source is this:  \n04:12\u00a0<amon>\u00a0<div class=\"xwikirenderingerror\">Failed to execute the [velocity] macro</div><div class=\"xwikirenderingerrordescription hidden\"><pre>org.xwiki.rendering.macro.MacroExecutionException: Failed to evaluate Velocity Macro for content [#set($msgParameter=$msg.get(\"xe.officeimporter.openoffice.parameter\"))  \n04:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0below that  \n04:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0the bottom \"caused by\"  \n04:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0the one you passed to me, the bottom message was:  \n04:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: templateProfileDir must exist and be a directory  \n04:15\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: invalid templateProfileDir: /usr/share/tomcat6/.openoffice.org/3  \n04:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0try: ls /usr/share/tomcat6/.openoffice.org/3  \n04:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0try: ls /usr/share/tomcat6/.openoffice.org/3/  \n04:17\u00a0<amon>\u00a0yes, it's okay.  \n04:17\u00a0<amon>\u00a0nothing in the directory though  \n04:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh  \n04:18\u00a0<amon>\u00a0so mode/ownership problem? Doesn't like its own default selections?  \n04:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0What I did (and I have no idea if it's the \"correct\" way) was to copy everything from my directory to tomcat's  \n04:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0user@debo8:~$ ls /usr/share/tomcat5.5/.openoffice.org/3/user/  \n04:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a03 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0autotext \u00a0basic \u00a0\u00a0database \u00a0psprint \u00a0\u00a0Scripts \u00a0temp \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0uno\\_packages  \n04:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0autocorr \u00a0backup \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0config \u00a0gallery \u00a0\u00a0registry \u00a0store \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0template \u00a0wordbook  \n04:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0and what I did to get that was:  \n04:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0cp /home/user/.openoffice.org2/\\* /usr/share/tomcat5.5/.openoffice.org/3/  \n04:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0-R  \n04:20\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay let me see if there is an equiv for tomcat6  \n04:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0then ofc chown tomcat55 /usr/share/tomcat5.5/.openoffice.org/ -R  \n04:21\u00a0<amon>\u00a0okay, here's the problem then. This is a fresh install and there is no tomcat5.5 and the tomcat6 directory is the very one that is empty  \n04:22\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0right, I'm running 5.5 so replace 5.5 with 6  \n04:23\u00a0<amon>\u00a0exactly. And that gives us the directory which I created manually and which is empty...  \n04:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm does that directory belong to tomcat?  \n04:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I copied the files into the directory from a user which had previously run openoffice but thinking about it, that shouldn't be necessary  \n04:24\u00a0<amon>\u00a0ah, so let me look at the owner ship angle.  \n04:30\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Nope. But since you use /home/user, I am going to try switching to something like that instead of the default selection. Perhaps it really wants a 'home' directory. Does /home/user have an owner? is it tomcat6 and is that a home directory for tomcat6 in /etc/passwd?  \n04:30\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0on my computer (desktop) I use the user \"user\" for general stuff  \n04:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I use the user tomcat55 for tomcat stuff and since xwiki needs access to the directory, it's in the /usr/share/tomcat5.5/ directory which is owned by tomcat55  \n04:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0try ls -la /usr/share/tomcat6/.openoffice.org/3  \n04:34\u00a0<amon>\u00a0\u00a0ls -la /usr/share/tomcat6/.openoffice.org/3  \n04:34\u00a0<amon>\u00a0total 8  \n04:34\u00a0<amon>\u00a0drwxr-xr-x 2 tomcat6 tomcat6 4096 2011-08-27 20:51 .  \n04:34\u00a0<amon>\u00a0drwxr-xr-x 3 tomcat6 tomcat6 4096 2011-08-27 20:51 ..  \n04:36\u00a0<amon>\u00a0On your system what shows up when you do the Administration->OpenOffice Server ?  \n04:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0it's not currently connected, my tomcat based server is in pieces atm  \n04:39\u00a0<amon>\u00a0ah. I'm going to go a-googling for a little while.  \n04:45\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I've also got a suspicion that if I restart my Firefox, the javascript problem might fix itself. I'm going to try that also.  \n05:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I found some more docs on it, non of which exactly are applicable but I checked on my laptop where there actually is a user (me) and found that the current Ubuntu/libreoffice has this:  \n05:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0ls /home/amon/.openoffice.org/3  \n05:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0MIGRATED \u00a0user  \n05:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0amon@otv2:~$ ls /home/amon/.openoffice.org/3/user/  \n05:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0autocorr \u00a0backup \u00a0config \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0gallery \u00a0registry \u00a0store \u00a0template \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wordbook  \n05:02\u00a0<amon>\u00a0autotext \u00a0basic \u00a0\u00a0database \u00a0psprint \u00a0Scripts \u00a0\u00a0temp \u00a0\u00a0uno\\_packages  \n05:03\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I'm wondering what might happen if I rsync this across...  \n05:09\u00a0<amon>\u00a0That seems to have done something. So it appears not to auto-populate. Which means that something, somewhere is wrong because I cannot imagine an install should require this level of deep magic.  \n05:10\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0All I can say is that is what I did, there's probably some instructions somewhere but I never read those ;)  \n05:10\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The author of the office code is mflora who is not here atm  \n05:14\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Now that I have it running, the next question is how to use it, then how to explain it to a non-computer tech writer...  \n05:14\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0You have exported pdf documents before right?  \n05:14\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Yep. What I'm looking for is the ability for them to work in their familiar Word environment  \n05:15\u00a0<amon>\u00a0And to cut and paste links and have it work afterwards...  \n05:15\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0When you export pdf documents now, it will use the openoffice as the backend  \n05:16\u00a0<amon>\u00a0So do I have to open a new document in some special way to get it in an open office word format and then copy content into it?  \n05:16\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Or should the office stuff work on existing pages?  \n05:17\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Well, the export is fine, but it is primarily the live edit that has been the big issue  \n05:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0There is also office import but I have not done it so you will need to read up on how that works.  \n05:23\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I was hoping that the Office Import WYSWYG meant I get to edit in Open office style on the wiki. Perhaps not.  \n05:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/OfficeImporter  \n05:25\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Yeah, got that. Looks like it does a lot less than I had hoped.  \n05:28\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Well, I'm glad I got it working and it will probably be somewhat useful but it is not going to help make our document closer to a real .doc file. There's not even any way to center text, change the font, etc, etc... unless you do it manually in the Source format, which I am not even going to \\*IMAGINE\\* telling my proposal team to do  \n05:30\u00a0<amon>\u00a0How would you go about setting the font to Times Roman 12 and creating a centered diagram with text centered under it? Without writing source code?  \n05:32\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Probably means we have to call an end to the draft at some point, lift the document into a .doc and shift to the old fashioned way for the final drafts, change tags and email...  \n05:33\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Must be someone here who has done proposals. What sort of process did you use?  \n05:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0doesn't the wysiwyg editor support that?  \n05:35\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I don't see anything for selecting a region and changing the font.  \n05:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh I see. No center/font stuff  \n05:37\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I have to do specific fonts as specified in the Solicitation.  \n05:38\u00a0<amon>\u00a0It's not an option, it's a requirement.  \n05:39\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Got to be a way to do it in XWiki and I'll probably feel dumb when someone tells me. It's an Enterprise solution so by definition it's got to be there...  \n05:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0What exactly are you doing where font and center is important, I'm just trying to get a picture of what you're using it for since I imagine a wiki as more of a collaborative notepad.  \n05:40\u00a0<amon>\u00a0The Solicitation document requires that we use Times Roman 12 pt; I have a number of figures and graphics that need to be centered with the Fig n: some-text-description under them.  \n05:40\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Hmmm... lights just blinked. If I go away its the power going out.  \n05:40\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://xoffice.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/  \n05:41\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Again, I'm not the expert in this field but it looks like there's yet another component which interfaces with microsoft office allowing it to do just what you were saying.  \n05:44\u00a0<amon>\u00a0yeah, but that one requires you are on an MS platform. Our VM is Ubuntu Natty; the proposal team are mixed Linux and MS so we trade Open/Libre Office and MS Office .doc files around via email usually, which has been a really serious pain and is what I'm trying to get away from.  \n05:46\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Oh well, maybe if I play with it awhile I can find some way to utilize it. There has got to be a way to set fonts. I just cannot imagine there isn't.  \n05:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0ok so you want one of 2 things: \u00a01. Edit wiki pages in openoffice on your desktop and save them without copy/paste or 2. Font, center, (other things?) in wysiwyg.  \n05:46\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0correct?  \n05:51\u00a0<amon>\u00a0pretty much. And btw, in documentation on WYSYWYG editor, there is mention of a plugin named font that lets you set things. But someone here last night was saying plugins are obsolete?  \n05:51\u00a0<amon>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/WysiwygEditor  \n05:52\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0haha different plugins  \n05:53\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://127.0.0.1:8080/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=WYSIWYG  \n05:53\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0it looks like you can enable fonts there  \n05:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0found it  \n05:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://127.0.0.1:8080/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=WYSIWYG <-- here  \n06:00\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0you go to the plugins section and type font and click the + button  \n06:01\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0then in TOOL BAR section, type in: fontname (it should autocomplete) click + and fontsize (should also autocomplete) and + again  \n06:01\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0then click on fontname and drag it up to the top, so it's before the first | character.  \n06:01\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0same for fontsize, then scroll to the bottom and click save.  \n06:06\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I'm part way there, but I now have one of the proposals showing in WYSWYG and in regular page display with all of the html tags. In others words, I've badly effed something up and now I have to keep at it until I fix it.  \n06:09\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0The part about dragging them up to the beginning is not necessary, it was a coincidence that I did that and it takes some time and some pounding of ctrl+f5 to get it to flush the cache  \n06:10\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0also on the toolbar list you'll want to add justifycenter justifyfull justifyleft justifyright  \n06:11\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0and to plugins you have to add justify  \n06:12\u00a0<amon>\u00a0ah, rescued it. Now I go for the justify stuff  \n06:13\u00a0<amon>\u00a0And probably pretty much everything they've got  \n06:13\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I just \\*knew\\* this stuff had to be available somewhere.  \n06:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm perhaps I'll mention that this stuff should all be included by default and if loading takes too long and the user is an admin then it might say \"You can turn off some features by going [[here]]\"  \n06:27\u00a0<amon>\u00a0This is getting much, much better now. I'll just keep adding as I notice things I need that are missing. But I've got font, justification and colors now. Took awhile to get there and I suspect this in combination with the Office import should make life a lot easier on my folk  \n06:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0cool  \n06:50\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:32\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has quit  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n09:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n10:34\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n10:45\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n10:48\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n10:54\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n11:08\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:22\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<amon>\u00a0has quit  \n12:38\u00a0<amon>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:39\u00a0<microblue>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<microblue>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:39\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<microblue>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<amon>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n12:40\u00a0<microblue>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<amon>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n12:40\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:41\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0has quit  \n12:41\u00a0<xilun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:45\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has quit  \n12:45\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:18\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has quit  \n13:34\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:34\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n13:34\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0is now known as <rrodriguez>  \n13:43\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:04\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:11\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n18:14\u00a0<amon>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has quit  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:35\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:28\u00a0<patrek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:28\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<amon>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:34\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:56\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:56\u00a0<patrek>\u00a0has quit  \n23:45\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
