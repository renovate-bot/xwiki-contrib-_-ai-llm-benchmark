If I use @ComponentList({DefaultMyComponent.class}), I then have to list all the implementations of DefaultMyComponent's dependencies, when, instead, I would like to mock one of those dep  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: which doesn't make it right  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I talked to him  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he'll fix in 2.0.1  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"If I use @ComponentList({DefaultMyComponent.class}), I then have to list all the implementations of DefaultMyComponent's dependencies\"  \n14:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0A (component under test) depends on B (other component of my module) depends on C (component of other module). In A's test I write @ComponentList({DefaultA.class, DefaultC.class}), but I would like to be able to mock C in A's test, so to not specify DefaultC.class in @ComponentList  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: the thing is that the mocker does not load the component.txt so it does not know any implementation that's why you need to give it  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think so  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have to make sure there are impl available  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0be them the real one or mocked ones  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so list the real ones in @ComponentList and register mock component in the test  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0@ComponentList is not so much a way to indicate what to not mock but to indicate what are the available components  \n14:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so mocker.registerMockComponent(...) that overrides the default one listed?  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0make sure you really need the real ones as it's usually better to use mocks everywhere, unless you're writing some integration test  \n14:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it depends when you call mocker.registerMockComponent(...)  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: no, don't list them  \n14:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I want the real one for B (other part of my code) but not for C (3rd party component from other module)  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just list the real ones  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and mock the others  \n14:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so how do I mock C ?  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0registerMockComponen for ex  \n14:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mocker.getInstance will give me the real instance  \n14:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0aha  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it won't  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless you delcare the in @ComponentList  \n14:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and I can call registerMockComponent whenever?  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so don't declare them thtere  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@BeforeComponent for example  \n14:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0aha, looking into that...  \n14:35\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:35\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0Bonjour  \n14:36\u00a0<popcek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hi  \n14:36\u00a0<popcek>\u00a0hello... i have a question if its possible to autenticate xwiki over ldap with tls support  \n14:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0unsure re tls, tmortagne \u00a0?  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0popcek: some did AFAIK yes  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's more at general Java level than XWiki level actually  \n14:39\u00a0<popcek>\u00a0i try http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-865  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0popcek: I see http://xwiki.475771.n2.nabble.com/XWiki-and-LDAP-TLS-binding-td7589243.html  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have xwiki.authentication.ldap.ssl.secure\\_provider in xwiki.cfg and then you configure this provider through Java system properties  \n14:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:40\u00a0<popcek>\u00a0ok ... i ll try to set up java properties ...  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should find a few threads about that in the mailing list like the one mentionned by vmassol  \n14:42\u00a0<popcek>\u00a0so settting up xwiki.autentication.ldap.ssl.keystore in xwiki.cfg is useless?  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we are missing some clean documentation in xwiki.org written by someone who actually did it  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no it's not useless but it's actually possible to set it from Java properties too depending on the provider so your choice  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha and dont forget xwiki.authentication.ldap.ssl=1 too  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to enable SSL  \n14:46\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0Hello, I can't change the default skin logo through \"edit/XWiki/DefaultSkin\".
