Thanks for your help though :)  \n07:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0:) glad you've fixed it  \n07:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0what was the problem?  \n07:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0@teekay I'm glad it was you :)  \n07:58\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n08:12\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@evalica I got it work, thanks for the tip with the junco skin! The trick was to auto margin the xwikicontainer instead of the body...  \n08:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0@kaisen glad it worked in the end :) good to know the think about the body element, not sure why the WYSIWYG is influenced by this. Maybe because WYSIWYG adds an iframe that also contains a body.  \n08:21\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@evalica don't know but I glad to that I can go futher with design the wiki :)  \n08:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0@kaisen I'm also interested in design :) so maybe in the end \u2026 you will show me how it looks :)  \n08:23\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@evalica as it is only internal I only can provide you some screenshots as you will not have access... And I'm just make small changes comparing to the junco skin  \n08:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0@kaisen so in the end you're using junco. that's good, there are also links to the code if you'll even need to change some settings on it.  \n08:26\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0evalica - I forgot I placed a specific blacklist on one of my panels to not show certain spaces  \n08:26\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@evalica actual I'm not using the Junco Skin I just crib how you center it :)  \n08:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0@teekay - k - it's good that is not because of Applications panel, since that would mean a really big bug. with velocity variables is complicated because they are global. Glad you've fixed it  \n08:28\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0yea i didn't know everything was global!  \n08:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:55\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0where can I edit the shown panels in \"editor-mode\"  \n08:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:58\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0kaisen: hello  \n08:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0the panels are all located in the Panels space on your wiki  \n08:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:01\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:02\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@msmeria Yes, but if you edit a page there are other loaded than set up in the wiki or space  \n09:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:05\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0good mornig xwiki!  \n09:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0kaisen: I'm not sure I understand  \n09:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0if you want to edit a panel just edit its page in Inline mode -> check the Content section  \n09:06\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0I think he's talking about when you edit the panel for a particular space, then the wiki-wide panel will not get used  \n09:10\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0kaisen: teekay is right. if you set the order and displayed panels for a certain space, than the wiki panels won't be taken into account. the space panels settings override the wiki ones  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0msmeria: from what kaisen said, he is not talking about \"view\" action panels, but about panel shown during \"edit\" action  \n09:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0kaisen: are you looking for the editpanelsvars.vm template which decide which panel are displayed along side with each editors ?  \n09:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0Denis: yes, you're right. I missunderstood what he said :)  \n09:17\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0kaisen: you may override the editpanelsvars.vm template in your skin, see http://goo.gl/yH03CB , probably method 2  \n09:25\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@Denis thanks I wil have a look at  \n09:27\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n09:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:33\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@Denis ok got it work thanks alot! But can I also change the panelside from right to left?  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0kaisen: that's more configuration actually, you can decide what panels to put on the right or the left in the administration, it's just that there is no panel on the left by default  \n09:35\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@tmortagne yes thats for the normal panels but if you edit a page it use different panels.  \n09:35\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: he is talking about edit panels, not view ones  \n09:36\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Thanks to Denis I know to change them but now I want to move them to :)  \n09:37\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0kaisen: you will need to also override the edit.vm template to change the layout, it will be a bit more complex  \n09:37\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0But if this is to much work I can live with it that they are right  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n09:41\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0kaisen: you will also need some CSS tweaks, you should compare how leftpanels.vm/rightpanels.vm are included in endpage.vm, with the way editpanels.vm is used in edit.vm, and related styles  \n09:48\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@Denis Ok thats to much :)  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:10\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol1: hello  \n10:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol1: regarding XWIKI-10378: I've tested with the same jar on PostgreSQL and it's still not fixed. as a matter of fact I've now got a bigger stacktrace: http://pastebin.com/qkvyV3j7  \n10:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0that's why I was asking if I'm using the correct jar, since I'm not replacing an old jar, I'm just adding a new one  \n10:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I thought the fix was done by replacing a jar  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0msmeria: otp, but thanks I'll check that later afterwards  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: you must remove the legacy oldcore jar  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now you have 2 same jars  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the stack trace is the same as before  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol> 1.

 \n14:48\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0other than getting the latest stable XWiki version I mean  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this wiki is dedicated to releases version, what you are talking about would be a new feature  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can created a jira issue about that  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even the zip with XML inside are not XARs  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't have the package.xml so you can't import it  \n14:51\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I see  \n14:51\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0thanks  \n15:06\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0no one interested for <Slashman> hello, I'm looking for a way to display the table of content of \u00a0a page on an other page, is this possible? ?  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: {{toc/}} macro itself does not support that and there is nothing doing it by default in xwiki/2.x syntax  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0implementing one should not be too hard but you would need to know a it of Java  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/it/bit/  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it's doable in Velocity even it's a bit harder or Groovy too but it's about the same concept since it's all Java objects)  \n15:10\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I have some java dev here  \n15:11\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0what do you think is the easier way? java/velocity/groovy?  \n15:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the easiest is Java I think since the easiest is to take the current toc macro code and modify it to parse the content of another document instead of the current content basically  \n15:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the toc macro is on https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/tree/master/xwiki-rendering-macros/xwiki-rendering-macro-toc  \n15:15\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: ok thank you, I think I will be able to get some dev time next Monday, should I tell him to modify the current toc macro with the option to parse an other page or to create a new one? this could be added to the next release of xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0modifying the current toc macro will be a bit complexe since it's in commons which means it does not have access to wiki concept officially  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but on your side you can do whatever you want  \n15:16\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0hm ok  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it does not prevent you from providing an extension on http://extensions.xwiki.org which would probably be useful to others  \n15:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can of course lead a thread in the mailing list about moving standard toc macro on platform and adding target entity feature to it  \n15:18\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0is there an archetype for developing an extension?  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or provide a generic API in toc macro to implement in platform to access target id XDOM  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: if you are willing to work on this abstraction and long debate on mailing list then it's great :)  \n15:19\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0I think an extension will be the quickest way, my devs have a ton of work already, it must be relatively quick else the priority will be for the year 2050 :p  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vierfzweievieraz: extension can mean many things, it depend what kind of extension you want  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is an archetype for jar component based style extension I think, need to find the link  \n15:20\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0i thought you you said that  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but usually something easiest is to duplicate some similar extension and modify it  \n15:20\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0component archetype is maybe a good hint right?  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for jar extension yes  \n15:20\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0alright  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vierfzweievieraz: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingComponents#HCreatingaXWikicomponentusingMaven  \n15:21\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0thy, i am working with that already  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a page to read anyway for the whole XWiki component concept anyway which you will pretty much have to use in a java extension  \n15:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0extension is basically anything than extension manager can install which can be anything, right now it support XAR which is a zip with wiki pages in it and any jar which are simply injected in the right classloader at runtime  \n15:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(plus some initialization for component in the jars etc of course)  \n15:23\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0ii already deployd my first app  \n15:23\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0it's nice and that page is awesome documented  \n15:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: will be a good inspiration if anyone want to include that in standard anyway  \n15:24\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0what i am really strugling with is to load the right classes as in: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Observation+Module+Local#HConsumingandproducingevents  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vierfzweievieraz: the archetype is not always perfectly up to date, don't hesitate to report it on http://jira.xwiki.org if you have an issue with it (it's using some deprecated API or something)  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vierfzweievieraz: what issue do you have with classes exactly ?  \n15:25\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0thx, but untill now did not a single problem with it (5.4.4 or 6.0.1)  \n15:26\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0where are those? in which maven package?  \n15:26\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0as you can see here http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|c%3A%22XWikiDocument%22%20v%3A%224.0%22 not above version 4  \n15:26\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n15:27\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's because this is not really the XWikiDocument class  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the XWikiDocument class is in platform which is not published in maven central  \n15:27\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0hi everyone, i'm getting a HTTP 500 status error when tryingt to get xwiki working...here is the error i'm getting http://pastebin.com/bY26RvcN  \n15:27\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0suddenly from version 4 its org.xwiki.tool.xar.XWikiDocument and not the \"xpn\" one  \n15:27\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0i know that  \n15:28\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0but i could not find it in the xwiki nexus either  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0how do you search in Nexus ?

 \n15:32\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0with the version 6.1-milestone-1?  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again xwiki-commons-tool-xar-plugin does not contains XWikiDocument  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the one you found it it is just some internal hack  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the real one is in xwiki-platform-oldcore  \n15:33\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0oh  \n15:33\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0so what would be the artefactid?  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't have the whole XWiki on maven central  \n15:33\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0no problem, i am already using your nexus  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the artifact  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0groupid:artifactid  \n15:34\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0and i did search there for everything, i knew the class i found was not correct, but expected to find it somewhere else  \n15:34\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0and is this class maybe in the \"new\" core?  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this class is actually one of the oldest class of XWiki  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vierfzweievieraz: http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;classname~XWikiDocument  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you get lots of suff since it's an old class but when you sort by version you get oldcore it seems  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even better http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;classname~com.xpn.xwiki.doc.XWikiDocument  \n15:39\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0(was not aware of the advance search)  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0legacy-oldcore is a special build with some old deprecated API (like all pakcages with legacy in the name) you should not depend on that  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(me neither, just discovered it :))  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's nice  \n15:40\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0putting that in the API page  \n15:40\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0:)  \n15:41\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0but wait, why is this class - since there is no new one in the \"new\" core - in the old core?  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no sure I understand the question  \n15:42\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0the class in the package oldcore  \n15:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWikiDocument always been there, the package containing this class changed name several times  \n15:42\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0for my understanding it will get deprecated somewhen  \n15:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but now before a long time actually  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't get much time working on new model so it's not going to happen anytime soon  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you can go and use that class  \n15:43\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0yes, but for that it is a new one needed right? i thought i could work and learn the new \"api\" or class with version 6  \n15:43\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0alright  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0plus we never delete any class as much as possible, just deprecated them  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no new one  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the new model is far from reason and not even released  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/reason/ready/  \n15:44\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0ok  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you don't really have a choice :)  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the module is called oldcore because it's stuff we want to deprecated one day but the last one is probably going to be this class :)  \n15:45\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0^^  \n15:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:06\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:06\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0hi everyone, i'm getting a HTTP 500 status error when tryingt to get xwiki working...here is the error i'm getting http://pastebin.com/bY26RvcN  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0junix659: it means you hibernate.cfg.xml files is wrong  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"The content of element type \"session-factory\" must match \u00a0\"(property\\*,mapping\\*,(class-cache|collection-cache)\\*,event\\*,listener\\*)\"\" to be more precise  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess you have some element in there not in the right place or not in the right order  \n16:13\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0oh  \n16:18\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0I have my mysql server on different server/container  \n16:18\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0i chagned the jdbc:mysql: string  \n16:18\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0to reflect the IP of the server mysql is hosted on  \n16:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:20\u00a0<junix659>\u00a0anything else i can try?
