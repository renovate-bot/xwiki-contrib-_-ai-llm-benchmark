We have a strange issue on xwiki-enterprise-text-extension. XWikiServletContextListener fails to find the default ObservationManager and CM fails because with \"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class java.util.Formatter\"  \n09:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I can reproduce locally  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0interesting  \n09:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0XWikiSerlvetContextListener calls CM for ObservationManager, CM fails and tries to log the exception but String.format fails because of java.util.Formatter  \n09:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0hello vmassol  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: nothing actually, I was wondering if the skin at space level was busted or not but it's probably just that the guy used a non existing skin  \n09:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: Hi  \n09:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0any idea what would cause what's described on \"Failed migration from 3.0 to 4.3.1\" on mailing list  \n09:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like there is also another mail with the same issue  \n09:13\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: I'm sure the guy didn't knew we removed toucan. I've updated the documentation  \n09:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Upgrading from XWiki Enterprise 2.3 to 4.4\"  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, am I right in saying that on a farm, the only way to install pages that require PR is with a global user that has PR? And even when installing a backup pack (if the user is XWiki.Admin - ie local admin) the pages will not get PR  \n09:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: well it depends user is supposed to be xwiki:XWiki.Admin in most of ours xar now  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so ackup pack should work too  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as long as it's done with a user who have PR  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: that's provided such a user exists  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example on myxwiki.org do we have it? checking  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's that does not have anything to do with subwikis  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think we have it  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by anyway yes we have an issue with PR for any subwiki admin that want to upgrade his wiki  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes there's one: http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Admin  \n09:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you don't have PR you are not supposed to have the right to import as backup pack  \n09:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it used to be that way, hope it's still the case  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm really, didn't know that  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what happens?  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0an error?  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're not shown the option?  \n09:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't remember, I think you are not supposed to see the option yes  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so for myxwiki.org users cannot actually upgrade their wikis?  \n09:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not all the pages yes but most of the pages that require PR to work at all are for wrong reason  \n09:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0requiring PR to display an index of pages is a bug  \n09:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it's pretty sreious since the home page will bug  \n09:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the Activity page requires PR  \n09:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the home page require PR ?  \n09:21\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0From Package.Import: boolean backup = this.backupPack && isFarmAdmin(context);  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep through Main.Activity  \n09:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seriously...  \n09:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we are not supposed to have any page requiring PR in XE and we make it worst  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: ok, so it'll seem to work but won't in practice?  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: we've always had for a long time, this is not new  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we even have a marker for these pages  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's not like we didn't know\u2026 :)  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it does not make it good  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the home page was not requiring PR before  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but it makes myxwiki.org unusable to upgrade  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the home page doesn't require PR  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so we keeping adding new PR pages  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but Main.Activity does  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thus breaking the home page  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the same  \n09:24\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0vmassol: no isFarmAdmin means admin rights on main wiki. \u00a0For admins of subwikis, the backup flag is cleared.  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: you mean they cannot sleect the option?  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or the option is discarded if selected?  \n09:25\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0I don't know if they can select the option, but it will be cleared if they can.  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok guys I've just replied to the thread \"No Activity Stream\"  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you could verify that what I've said is correct that would be great  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this seems really worse than I thought initially  \n09:30\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0tmortagne: the failing migration is on MS SQL, it might be the cause ?  \n09:30\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0since we're not supporting it  \n09:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan`: he gets a message saying that migration are disabled  \n09:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if true then the message is at least very bad  \n09:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and anyway I don't think we have any test for some officially supportedl database at this leve  \n09:31\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0nope, not yet  \n09:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so there is a bug for sure or something very weird in the configuration if you get a message telling you you did not enabled migration when you enabled it  \n09:41\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:58\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one good news about all the xwiki.org restarts is that the bot works quite well and restarts well by itself :)  \n10:05\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally playground messages are gone and I've temporarily removed broken links (I need to work more on it, it seems to stop working after the first hits)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no luck :)  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems it's honoring only the first exclude  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0debugging  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, are we ready to release 4.5M1 today?  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I feel that we should release it, even with the existing blockers: http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=resolution+%3D+Unresolved+and+priority+%3D+Blocker+and+category+%3D+%22Top+Level+Projects%22+and+issue+not+in+%28%22XCOMMONS-324%22%29  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?

And compared to \"install on wiki\" the difference is only that components are registered against the root cm right?  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: for jar yes, for xar it means it's installed everywhere and when a wiki is created it's automatically installed there too etc  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah hmm had forgotten that part  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there's no way to have the ui installed only on a wiki and have the components in the root cm?  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not if you install them all in the same install job  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you can install them separately  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that's an issue for my use case then\n"}
