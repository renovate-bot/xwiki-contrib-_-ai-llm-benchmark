 \n16:09\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0ok, I will check  \n16:09\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but please give me a proper input  \n16:10\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0like the xar page that I have attached to the issue  \n16:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well the steps are the same as yesterday.. do you want a XAR with that page ?  \n16:10\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes  \n16:11\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0with the page before the upgrade  \n16:11\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0OR, you could first use the xar that I have provided  \n16:11\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and tell me if, on that xar, the issue still exists  \n16:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay, checking now your XAR  \n16:12\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0ok  \n16:14\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0wait  \n16:14\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0:)  \n16:14\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I think I was too tired last night and committed only on master :)  \n16:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n16:17\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0there's something wrong on jenkins  \n16:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so should I abort testing ?  \n16:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0looks like the master platform commits triggered a jenkins master platform build (normal) but which in turn triggered a 4.0 platform jenkins build (useless) as well, which in turn triggered a 4.0 enterprise build (useless)  \n16:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0that's why I thought the builds were OK  \n16:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes, I am cherry-picking the commits into the 4.0 branch now  \n16:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: looking, I tough I had fixed all theses dependencies issues on jenkins  \n16:19\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: : I will check monday the Annotations MIgration. Edy found some issue on Jenkins, so I can't test the annotations migration on 4.0 branch.  \n16:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0sburjan: in the meanwhile, you could do the test on 4.1-SNAPSHOT to save time  \n16:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0since it's the same thing  \n16:20\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so everything related to the merge is committed in 4.0 too ? maybe a fix that is not common could impact  \n16:20\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0in 4.1, yes  \n16:21\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'd feel more secure on testing 4.0, but if you guarantee the 4.0 and 4.1 is identical (in terms of the annotations and merge feature) it's ok  \n16:21\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yep, no new commits in 4.1  \n16:21\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, testing 4.1 now  \n16:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm I don't understand wht jenkins think xwiki-platform-4.0 depends on xwiki-platform  \n16:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is nothing in the conf saying that  \n16:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's supposed to find dependencies from the pom.xml  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:24\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: testing latest 4.1 snapshot  \n16:25\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:27\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Eduard Moraru\u000f stable-4.0.x\u000f \\* rffc1d1a\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/ffc1d1ae3dd59b911fed66634fe665d9d8650c46 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-annotations/xwiki-platform-annotation-io/src/main/java/org/xwiki/annotation/io/internal/DefaultIOService.java :\u000f XWIKI-7744: Stacktrace when adding an annotation - http://git.io/txkUkw  \n16:27\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Eduard Moraru\u000f stable-4.0.x\u000f \\* rd0230b5\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d0230b520dcdec078c6bb1c73fcd462ed696b4c7 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-annotations/xwiki-platform-annotation-io/src/main/java/org/xwiki/annotation/internal/CheckAnnotationClassEventListener.java :\u000f XWIKI-7747: Right after an migration to 4.0, the current Annotations class is not updated and new annotations are not created properly - http://git.io/9zaCyg  \n16:27\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Eduard Moraru\u000f stable-4.0.x\u000f \\* r07cd2f4\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/07cd2f4293e47a5a45dc5cf83491ca109f565a34 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-annotations/xwiki-platform-annotation-io/src/main/java/org/xwiki/annotation/io/internal/migration/hibernate/R40001XWIKI7540DataMigration.java :\u000f XWIKI-7745: Migration of Annotations and Comments to 4.0 breaks page consistency - http://git.io/X-bsKw  \n16:38\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0sburjan: the next 4.0 build should contain the fixes.  \n16:39\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cool, I'll perform a final check on monday  \n16:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yep, in the meanwhile, please let me know (when you finish) if it is still reproducible on 4.1-SNAPSHOT  \n16:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0done. everything looks ok using 4.1  \n16:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0only thing is that I have annos, comments, annos again (added after migration) but this is not a bug it's just an ordering issue  \n16:44\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it's ordered by date  \n16:45\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0since you start by adding 10 annotations, then add 10 comments and then 10 replies  \n16:45\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the result will be ordered:  \n16:45\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a010 annotations, 10 comments (each with 1 reply)  \n16:45\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and finally, whatever you annotations you add after the migration, will be last  \n16:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, then it's all good  \n16:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0date makes the most sense  \n16:48\u00a0<Shaddox>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Sergiu Dumitriu\u000f xwiki-enterprise-3.5.1\u000f \\* r06fce93\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/commit/06fce93388085da93cba23229b094a427ada595b \u000f/ pom.xml :\u000f [release] Preparing release xwiki-enterprise-3.5.1 - http://git.io/2c5IEQ  \n17:57\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Sergiu Dumitriu\u000f xwiki-enterprise-3.5.1\u000f \\* r5bb9640\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/commit/5bb96409c9fd59431f2e5f5e880f3bb1d912e5b0 \u000f/ (17 files in 17 dirs):\u000f [maven-release-plugin] prepare release xwiki-enterprise-3.5.1 - http://git.io/F-Y7Iw  \n18:07\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Sergiu Dumitriu\u000f xwiki-manager-3.5.1\u000f \\* r0256916\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-manager/commit/0256916f14ca51bd9df3e52dc07dc99efc8f86a3 \u000f/ pom.xml :\u000f [release] Preparing release xwiki-manager-3.5.1 - http://git.io/dVLxeg  \n18:07\u00a0<CIA-160>\u00a0Sergiu Dumitriu\u000f xwiki-manager-3.5.1\u000f \\* rcb3c9d9\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-manager/commit/cb3c9d9cb068c42afadfc9950103dfb58af88353 \u000f/ (13 files in 13 dirs):\u000f [maven-release-plugin] prepare release xwiki-manager-3.5.1 - http://git.io/vcKXsw  \n18:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Guys, can you check www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise351 ?
