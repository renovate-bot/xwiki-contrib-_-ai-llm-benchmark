The error is in workspacetemplate database or in xwiki database ?  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=11291 cleanly reflects the work done for 4.4  \n10:45\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0cjd: so what can I do to debug further ?  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: not sure what this has to do with the server/connector version  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have the connector version on the jar file name  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and for mysql it depends of your system, on linux you can type \"mysql --version\"  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for when the error happen, according to the stack trace it seems to be during template creation  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so either:  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* there is a bug in the connector  \n10:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: this message is slightly confusing, more confusing than on XE http://pastebin.com/e29sanV1  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's XE sburjan  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should talk to Denis about it....  \n10:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I got this on XEM :P  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it comes from XE code  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have the same thing on XE  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: could you check the encoding used in the template database ?

Theoretically, you are right, since if it's fixed for 4.3 final, then it is also fixed for 4.4-m1. However, practically, those are 2 different branches and the commit from master (4.4-m1) is also cherry-picked to 4.3 (4.3.x).

I only got a stacktrace when installing (WorkspaceManager.Install) but from Lucene indexer regarding some attachment (relatively normal)  \n15:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0could it be some leftover config on you mysql?  \n15:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I always clear the databases when testing  \n15:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am abs positive db was clear because DW kicked in  \n15:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mysql \u00a0Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.27, for Linux (x86\\_64) using readline 5.1  \n15:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this is what I have installed  \n15:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0maybe you have some config in your mysql config file  \n15:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0one of the machines (one from home) is pure vanilla MySQL  \n15:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0another user has reported it, so I'm not paranoia  \n15:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but still odd.  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: I can't find any XWIKI-8646 issue  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nor can the bot :)  \n15:28\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0Strange. \u00a0Maybe I have mistyped it. \u00a0I'll check.  \n15:28\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0Its supposed to be XWIKI-8464.  \n15:29\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0:(  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: this issue has no descirption  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you add one to explain why it's important to fix and what it brings?  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie why you decided to fix this  \n15:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: I`ve created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8515 for the translations issue.  \n15:30\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0It a followup to XWIKI-8398.  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I've just read XWIKI-8398 and I still don't understand the original problem  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\" (which causes regressions because it is assumed to have been set).\"  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what regression?  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why is the problem new?  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I want to see how important is the original issue vs all that's been broken)  \n15:32\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0The simple fix to only set it to false in loadXWikiDoc causes regressions.  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a fix for what?  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0said differently  \n15:33\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0It is a fix for the fact that the dirty bit was always true, which is a blocker for feature-authorization-context.  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"The flag isContentDirty in XWikiDocument is not cleared when a document is loaded from the database.\" \u00a0<\u2014 what are the problems caused by this?  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0It seems strange that something that looks so simple is causing so many changes all around :)  \n15:36\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0Yes, indeed. ;)  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has someone else brainstormed with you about the best way to fix this or did you do all this by yourself?  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there might some other way you haven't think about  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(some simpler way that don't break APIs that is)  \n15:37\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0I've written an email about it, but I have not gotten much respons.  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah that was when I was on holiday and the mail looked complex  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not many people want to touch this deep since it means breaking stuff  \n15:43\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0vmassol: The problem can be summed up as follows: Dirty flag must be propagated to owning instance of XWikiDocument when changing property values, attachments and class definitions for the version number to be updated. List properties are especially problematic. \u00a0We need a list wrapper, but hibernate alread wraps collections. \u00a0In practice, I think that the orm-framework should be (and probably is) capable of maintaining dirty flags and version numbe  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: just read your tutorial.Cool. I have 2 comments: 1) a pity your class used \"Provider\" as prefix since Provider already has a specific meaning for us (in the component world, see atinject Provider) and 2) re the custom displayer, do we have to add a vm file or can it be written as a wiki page too (or as a java class)?  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah and the last screenshot is a bit small ;)  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the one but last actually)  \n15:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's not a screenshot of a full wiki page, but a screen shot of how the prop is displayed  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the one about the home page  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*last but one  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not one but last ;))  \n15:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0\"Screenshot\" -> pretty name  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: the home page screenshot is really small, I can't see anything in it  \n15:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's normal  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok I get it now  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's funny  \n15:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0because the purpose is not to show the home page  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes just got it  \n15:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it really doesn't matter what is in the image  \n15:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but I see how it can be confusing  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow that's funny how my mind didn't want to see that  \n15:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I kept clicking on iot  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that it opens in big  \n15:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n15:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0re (1) that's the best name I could think of, and I didn't want to use something bad just to avoid Provider. It's a provider in the end, even if not the same provider that we have for components. Re (2) There are other ways to create the custom displayer, in this tutorial I just described one. Unfortunately there's no doc about custom displayers besides RN  \n15:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll say that \"one way to create the displayer is..\" and link the release notes for more ways  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better is to create a doc explaining the different ways :)  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it mean we missed a documentation field in a jira issue?  \n15:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes we did :)  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0must have been when I was on holiday :)  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just kidding)  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still would be good to fix that lapse  \n16:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8085, I've had enough doc for today though :), I'd like to finish fixing the tests  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: sure that can wait tomorrow :) ahah  \n16:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:D  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seriously, when you have time but don't forget it, it's an important feature  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm curious to learn how to do that too :))  \n16:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0maybe sdumitriu can do it :)  \n16:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0otherwise I can make some time  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep maybe  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0might be quicker to do it than to convince him though.....  \n16:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:09\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Enygma`: just tested XE and XE is fine.
