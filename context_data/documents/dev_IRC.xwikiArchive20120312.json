So I guess you're saying the solution is to split the velocity block  \n10:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see what this has to do with verbatim block  \n10:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0wiki syntax would not be interpreted in the verbatim block either  \n10:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0no, my idea was to wrap the branch that doesn't need wiki syntax in verbatim block  \n10:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you have one part for the JSON and another for when viewing the page itself ?  \n10:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n10:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0is that really needed ?  \n10:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0wdym?  \n10:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why having a view mode ? just JSON is well enough IMO  \n10:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0no  \n10:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0one part is the live table results, and one part generates the live table  \n10:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0by \"viewing the page itself\" I understood viewing the live table  \n10:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0couldn't you have several pages ?  \n10:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure.. but the one that generates the live table results would be a few lines of code, because I just need to do a replace..  \n10:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'd rather keep the code together  \n10:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0problem is that splitting the velocity block will not help you much  \n10:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0why?  \n10:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'll duplicate the test ofc  \n10:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or you mean two if with no else ?  \n10:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n10:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that would no it indeed  \n10:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'll do so. The part that generates the live table results is a temporary hack because AWM doesn't generate/register a translation page and I have to replace a translation key in the live table results.  \n10:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so I prefer to keep it in the same page as the generator until I don't need it  \n10:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n10:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0s/generator/live table generator  \n10:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0any case using verbatim block is not safe because if you have }}} in your content it will break it  \n10:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ah, right  \n10:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in other scripr macro you can directly return the blocks you want so you could have a if in the same block but it's too hard with velocity to do things like that  \n10:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyway have some blocker stuff to commit for 4.0M1 ?
