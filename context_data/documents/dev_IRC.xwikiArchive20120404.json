I am good at understanding user interaction with software and know java too but I am new to html,css and javascript. So am I eligible for your proposed project?  \n18:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0from my point of view, yes, as long as you understand \"how web works\" (http, application server notions, java for the web, etc). The html shouldn't be that complicated, css can be minimal, it's not complicated either, javascript is a bit tougher but you can always do without  \n18:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0Rajan\\_Mistry: you should start by downloading xwiki and playing around with it, trying to understand how data structures in xwiki work, etc, do one of the tutorials (or an application brand new of yourself) and see if anything in the mean time rings a bell wrt what workflows should mean  \n18:08\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0if you have questions (and I assume you would), my preferred way is the mailing list, since I can answer asynchronously  \n18:08\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0have you been in another GSoC before?  \n18:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<Rajan\\_Mistry>\u00a0Ya I have installed xwiki enterprise and trying to get to know it and I am applying GSOC for first time  \n18:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0also, picking an issue on our bugtracker and trying to fix it so that we see how you code can be a plus  \n18:10\u00a0<Rajan\\_Mistry>\u00a0ok  \n18:11\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0what I would be interested also to see about this project is the vision: how do you think this feature would be used, some more usecases, etc  \n18:12\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the drive of OS contribution is a very need of one's own, in general, and I think it's good propulsion  \n18:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<Rajan\\_Mistry>\u00a0and also can you tell me please how to contact via mailing list?  \n18:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Rajan\\_Mistry: see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/MailingLists  \n18:30\u00a0<Rajan\\_Mistry>\u00a0Thank you  \n18:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<kalabalik>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<kalabalik>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<Rajan\\_Mistry>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:03\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:16\u00a0<kalabalik>\u00a0Hello there! I will apply for the GSoC program with my own project idea and am looking for a potential mentor. My project will share some of the Wiki philosophy (especially the crowdsourcing idea) and some of the technology XWiki is using (especially HTML, CSS and JavaScript). Do you think this would be enough proximity to XWiki for you to consider my application?  \n20:19\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hey kalabalik  \n21:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm not so sure, we prefer projects that are closely related to the XWiki ecosystem  \n21:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Depends on what your idea is  \n21:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But in general, you'll have a hard time to get your own project accepted in GSoC, not just with XWiki  \n21:43\u00a0<qwebirc81267>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:05\u00a0<kalabalik>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n22:13\u00a0<qwebirc81267>\u00a0Hello friends, I was looking over the list of project and the proposal for the use of Foundation caught my eye. The integration of the trending idea of responsive web design, via foundation, is definitely interesting: balancing between usability and weight. My current plans for implementation would be: implementation of framework -> skinning Foundation to XWiki\u2019s current design language -> optimization -> separation of codes (  \n22:13\u00a0<qwebirc81267>\u00a0has quit  \n22:14\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:14\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0oops, i forgot to change my user. On the last point, I think RWD is a great idea, but it seems like some codes/information become unnecessary at different levels\u2014eg. Layout at 2048px isn\u2019t required on a 480px display (esp. when datas are hidden in smaller screens)\u2014and just adds to more data being transferred, which, in my opinion, becomes strenuous with limited mobile data usage. \u00a0That being said I do agree with the RWD prin  \n22:14\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0a great idea. But I think it should be extended to match the feel of XWiki, removing it from becoming \u201canother\u201d generic website, and optimization based on circumstances. I was wondering, before I create a more verbose plan, whether this is of interest to the XWiki community and if there are any input on my interpretation. (About me: I\u2019m experienced with css3, html, php & js. I\u2019ve began use of Codeigniter and Foundation in   \n22:14\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0An example of RWD implementation and css3 can be seen at http://jssolichin.com (still a bit rough and in the works))  \n22:14\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0i apologize for the wall of text.  \n22:31\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:31\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:32\u00a0<qwebirc67228>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<DrLou\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:11\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0has quit  \n23:12\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:54\u00a0<qwebirc67228>\u00a0has quit  \n23:55\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
