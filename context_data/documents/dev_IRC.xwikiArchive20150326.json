I guess it means they broke a lot of custom rules  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now 6.1.1 is not the last version, it's possible they fixed it afterwards  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed \u00a0for a new version of the plugin they are using an old version  \n10:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was expecting them to be more up to date  \n10:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hope it will be enough for Eclipse  \n10:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:22\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:53\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: nice, you gave clemens one BFD point for today :)  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vfzevaze: not sure if you saw my message of this morning  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"make sure to use the \"bugfixingday\" label on the issues you fix today (bugs only)\"  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: he did all the work, just did not dare closing the issue I guess  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah I figured that  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vfzevaze: contrib projects count  \n11:21\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0vmassol  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if you do you'll find yourself in http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=13191 ;)  \n11:21\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0vmasool thx , did not see that back then, on jira or in the svn commits?

 \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or maybe it was even before that  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep seems to be that, I have the rtf before your new menu  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0closing as duplicate  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to ensure it was done on purpose though  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it was voted before the change anyway  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok and we did'nt have any jira issue for removing the RTF export?  \n11:28\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: indeed: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=gXBHGbxJ  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: that's the point, as I said we still have XWIKI-9972 open  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I will close it as duplicate of the new menu issue  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I'm just surprised that we didn't create any jira for removing the RTF export  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw have we removed it in the code too?  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I don't understand, that' what XWIKI-9972 is about, remoing rtf support  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes osrry misread  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you created it when the vote passed  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's not been done  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not fully  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless the code has been modified too  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems it was done cool  \n11:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue was mostly about the UI, I don't really see the point in breaking the API just to break it  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm wait  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no point in keepign the RTF code if we decided to drop it  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no RTF code  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the same code as PDF, you just indicate the type  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I thought there was some little stuff about RTF but I'm wrong it seems  \n11:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe something to convert the URL parameter to FOP parameter but I doubt there is much more  \n11:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0note that it is the same code for colibri: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/47be2697f54e4b2036aa1e6b8f76e9d85933a6b2/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/templates/contentmenu.vm#L59-59  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vfzevaze: what would be awesome is if you could use the following format for commit messages: \"<JIRA ID>: <description of issue here>\" and then any details you wish on the next line  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that allows to link the commits in JIRA automatically too btw  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW if you're interested in the JIRA best practices we follow: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DevelopmentPractices#HJIRABestPractices  \n11:40\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0vmassol well i did mention the jira id on the commit messages, but you mean to practice a standard format right? sure why not  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's what I meant  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0makes it easier to collaborate all together I think  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(a bit like coding standards)  \n11:40\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0there should be a checklist for developers developing and contributing to xwiki  \n11:41\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0you guys are very well organized  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you don't need the full URL  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that if we change the location of JIRA it'll still work ;)  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh we have that :)  \n11:41\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0:D  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all our rules/practices are defined on this wiki: http://dev.xwiki.org  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we don't enforce conrtib projects to follow them  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we recommend that they do as much as possible  \n11:42\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0i know that page, but is there a \\_checklist\\_ from a-z before releasing?  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0those rules/practices are mandatory for committing in the xwiki github orgnization though  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vfzevaze: not really, except the page we've written at http://contrib.xwiki.org/  \n11:43\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0well i am far from that, but i want to keep up on the standard while contributing  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's a good idea to do that  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if you have suggestion for improving our practices they're mostl welcom e;)  \n11:44\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0thumbs up  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<vfzevaze1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:32\u00a0<vfzevaze1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:33\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:21\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:39\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: if you consider it critical for 6.4.x then you also need to consider it critical for the 7.0 branch \u00a0(forgot this if you were already planning to merge it on 7.0 ;))  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahah  \n13:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0they are not very critical, but they are bugs \u2026.  \n13:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I know they won't break anything  \n13:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and if I don't put them now\u2026 I will forget later  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good for you! :) because otherwise you'll need to re-release 6.4.x and 7.0.x :)  \n13:49\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hunting for my next bug to fix\u2026 ;)  \n14:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing activeinstalls build now  \n14:47\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:06\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys I'd like to close http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11078# as won't fix.

 \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) it should be hidden  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03) the author is wrong  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a04) how do we configure the space where ratings go?  \n16:53\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0@vmassol as tmortagne said, those pages within the ExtensionMetadata contain the ratings for the extensions in the repository app  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a04) is documented in http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Ratings+Application I think  \n16:54\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0the default implementation of the rating module prior to integration into platform was to create a page for every single vote with a rating object attached to it  \n16:54\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0this has not been changed and needs to be improved  \n16:55\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a04) configuration is done through a RatingsConfig object located in the application's WebPreferences page  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a05) what is this R2 suffix ?  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you already fixed 2) and 3)?  \n16:56\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0for the repo app it would be Extensions.WebPreferences  \n16:56\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0R2 == rating #2  \n16:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr  \n16:57\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0it's incremented with each user that votes on a page  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so someone can rate as many times as they want?
