If you declare a parameter as required and specify a default value for it then you get an exception when you insert that macro with the wysiwyg because the parameter has no value (the editor doesn't send the default value) (I know, if it has a default value then it shouldn't be required, but if we consider the default value to be used to help the user input a value for the parameter, this i  \nanamarias - (14:43): however $context.macro.params.get($paramName)) does not return the default value  \ntmortagne - (14:44): mflorea: as you said, if user doe snotprovide a value for a required parameter i don't see why i should work  \ntmortagne - (14:45): the fact that the specified default value is useless as nothing to do with that  \nmflorea - (14:45): well, the user leaves the input as it is, fulled with the default value, but the editor doesn't send the default value  \ntmortagne - (14:45): i think in this case the WYSIWYG should send the default value  \ntmortagne - (14:46): mflorea: sure but as the user understand it he just did not want to change the value that is already here, the bug is at WYSIWYG level  \nmflorea - (14:46): tmortagne: that's bad because this way when you edit a macro all the default value will be added to the wiki syntax  \nmflorea - (14:46): I don't like it  \ntmortagne - (14:46): that should support properly reuired parameter  \ntmortagne - (14:46): mflorea: no  \ntmortagne - (14:46): you don't understabnd  \ntmortagne - (14:46): if not all default value  \ntmortagne - (14:47): i'm saying WYSIWYG should properly support requred values  \ntmortagne - (14:47): the WYSIWYG has this infromation  \nmflorea - (14:47): it does, wdym?  \ntmortagne - (14:47): so fir resuired value it should always send the value  \nmflorea - (14:47): ok, I see  \ntmortagne - (14:47): mflorea: it's part of the parameter descriptor api  \ntmortagne - (14:47): i don't know if you send it to teh WYSIWYG but i guess you do  \nmflorea - (14:47): got it, it's a bug  \nmflorea - (14:48): anamarias: can you open a bug on the wysiwyg editor?  \nanamarias - (14:49): mflorea sure  \nmflorea - (14:49): thanks  \nanamarias - (14:49): so the parameter should be sent, even when the default value is left as it was  \nmflorea - (14:49): if the parameter is required  \nmflorea - (14:50): otherwise no  \nanamarias - (14:50): ok  \nmflorea - (14:50): now, about the case when the parameter is not requried  \nanamarias - (14:50): one other thing,  \nanamarias - (14:50): $context.macro.params.parameterNames returns an empty list  \nmflorea - (14:50): should the rendering fill the parameter value with the default value?  \nanamarias - (14:51): if no value was provided for the parameters  \nanamarias - (14:51): not even the ones with default values  \nmflorea - (14:51): strange, looks like a bug  \ntmortagne - (14:51): mflorea: that's a wiki macro only issue actiually  \ntmortagne - (14:52): since java macros use java bean you already have this  \nmflorea - (14:52): ok, then anamarias can provide a fix for it :)  \ntmortagne - (14:52): the defutl value you get in the descriptor is generated by creating anew instance of the java bean and calling the getter for the parameter  \ntmortagne - (14:53): so the rendering does not need to do anything  \nmflorea - (14:53): I see  \nanamarias - (14:53): mflorea: yup, so getValue should return the default value if value set is null  \nmflorea - (14:53): anamarias: yes  \nanamarias - (14:53): wiki macro descriptor do no use the bean  \nanamarias - (14:53): \\*descriptors  \ntmortagne - (14:53): anamarias: that's why i said it's a wiki macro issue only and not rendering  \nanamarias - (14:54): but SHOULD the wiki macros use java beans too?  \ntmortagne - (14:54): anamarias: yes it will but it's not possible yet  \ntmortagne - (14:55): because you need dynamic bean descriptor  \ntmortagne - (14:55): taht need to be added to xwiki-properties  \ntmortagne - (14:55): i have a jira issue for it  \ntmortagne - (14:55): but it's not trivial  \nanamarias - (14:55): hmm i see  \ntmortagne - (14:55): so for now not needed just for the default value support  \ntmortagne - (14:56): it will be needed for parameter types support  \nanamarias - (14:56): we need parameter types support next  \ntmortagne - (14:56): see http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-4666  \nanamarias - (14:57): the gadget macros need types badly  \ntmortagne - (14:57): is it really than much critical ?  \ntmortagne - (14:58): it's a nice to have for wiki macro IMO  \nanamarias - (14:58): well, they really need the enum type  \nanamarias - (14:58): to display a select for them  \ntmortagne - (14:58): for example if you do yourmacro in groovy and other scripting language like jython i thinkyou don't really care about the varibles type, they are automatically converted when needed  \ntmortagne - (14:59): anamarias: ok  \nanamarias - (14:59): you can't expect the user to guess the required set of values  \ntmortagne - (14:59): note that a complex macro made by us should always be in JAVA IMO  \ntmortagne - (14:59): wiki macros are user tools  \nanamarias - (15:00): i need to generate(import) macros from gadgets  \nmflorea - (15:00): the problem is that you can't import gadget as java macros  \nanamarias - (15:00): in the interface you provide a gadget XML and a XWiki macro should be the result  \nmflorea - (15:01): you need to save them as objects, ie to persist them  \nanamarias - (15:01): is it possible to create a java macro like that? dinamically?  \ntmortagne - (15:01): ok but in this case enum will not help much  \ntmortagne - (15:01): it's not what you need  \ntmortagne - (15:01): enum are statics  \nanamarias - (15:01): i know :(  \nanamarias - (15:02): you can't create them dinamically  \ntmortagne - (15:02): what you need is http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/Propertiesdisplayers  \ntmortagne - (15:02): which is not yet even supported by java macros  \nanamarias - (15:02): i found some hacks though, but i don't think that's the way to do it :P  \nmflorea - (15:02): anamarias: you can use a special class which extends list and is know by the editor  \ntmortagne - (15:03): yes that's the only way to do it we have now  \nmflorea - (15:03): so the editor handles it as an enum  \ntmortagne - (15:03): but it can be endless for the editor  \nanamarias - (15:03): what class is that?  \nmflorea - (15:04): a class you make  \ntmortagne - (15:04): anamarias: it does not exist, you have to define a java class for your use case and it has to be supported by the WYSIWYG  \nmflorea - (15:04): exactly  \ntmortagne - (15:04): in other words there is no generic way like described in http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/Propertiesdisplayers\\*  \nmflorea - (15:05): the editor looks for the parameter type and if it detects this class then it handles it as an enum  \nanamarias - (15:05): i see  \nmflorea - (15:07): although the editor needs to access the allowed values in a static way, hmm  \ntmortagne - (15:07): mflorea: yes that's why it's endless you have to define one different class by usecase  \ntmortagne - (15:08): and it's impossible to use that for \"dynamic use cases\"  \nmflorea - (15:08): but i could use reflection  \ntmortagne - (15:08): mflorea: you only have the class  \ntmortagne - (15:08): sure you can use reflecion on the class but it's still all static datas  \nmflorea - (15:09): can I access a static field using only the class?  \ntmortagne - (15:09): mflorea: yes but well it's static :)  \nmflorea - (15:09): yes, but we can agree to use a know name for the field, like \"allowedValues\"  \nmflorea - (15:09): ah  \nmflorea - (15:09): :)  \nmflorea - (15:10): then anamarias can't fill the list :)  \ntmortagne - (15:10): yep  \nanamarias - (15:10): mflorea: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-4946  \ntmortagne - (15:10): it's kind of ok for java macro even a little hacky but there is nothing you can do for anamarias use case  \nanamarias - (15:11): nooo :(  \nsematicweboholic joined #xwiki at 15:11  \ntmortagne - (15:12): in a general way macro/parameter descriptor manipulation should never depends on reflection or it's not generic enough  \nmflorea - (15:13): yes  \ntmortagne - (15:14): we should not even have MacroDescriptor#getParametersBeanClass(), i need to refactor that but it's not critical for now  \nbblfish - (15:15): hello  \nvmassol - (15:16): bblfish: I'm going to be otp in a few seconds.

But I can't use a template because there is no way for users without edit right to save a document (to add the comment).  \nbblfish - (16:39): the header of this irc chat should have a link to the logs  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:40): The only option I can think of is add an application which has programming rights. Which would mean modify XWiki.getCommentsClass to add code to XWiki.CommentsClass document and set author to XWiki.Admin  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:41): And that's pretty ugly.  \nsdumitriu - (17:02): Better have a dependency in the core  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:05): I was just thinking that.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:06): I will make sure to put a big \"just until we have modular actions\" comment.
