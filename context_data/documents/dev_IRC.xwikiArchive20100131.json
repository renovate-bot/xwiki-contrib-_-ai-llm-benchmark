When do we move trunk to 2.3?  \nsdumitriu - (20:59): 2. Do you have an open issue for the bad display of some panels in the panel wizard?  \nvmassol - (20:59): re 1, I think it's a good idea to wait till 2.2 is released in final version  \nvmassol - (20:59): the reason is that this forces everyone  \nsdumitriu - (21:00): 3. Do you think it's safe to allow non-ASCII chars in attachment names, since the old WYSIWYG is deprecated?  \nvmassol - (21:00): to help on the stabilization/finish of XE 2.2  \nvmassol - (21:00): (otherwise some of us, me included would start working on the next things)  \nvmassol - (21:00): Re 2, you mean the pb with the toucan skin? If so, no I haven't created an issue  \nsdumitriu - (21:01): Yes, that one  \nvmassol - (21:01): re attachment names, the new rendering should work just fine (if that's the question). I don't know about other older parts of the code though  \nsdumitriu - (21:02): The blocker was the WYSIWYG editor  \nsdumitriu - (21:02): That's why we disabled them in the first place  \nvmassol - (21:02): so for 3. I \u00a0don't know for sure, it would need to be tested. I any case I'm +1 to allow this (maybe in 2.3 not to introduce any risk right now in 2.2 though)  \nsdumitriu - (21:03): XWIKI-2090 and XWIKI-2087  \nvmassol - (21:03): s/I any/In any/  \nsdumitriu - (21:03): Hm, the bot only looks at the first issue  \nsdumitriu - (21:03): XWIKI-2087  \nvmassol - (21:03): yes it does  \nvmassol - (21:03): I haven't coded the rule for several jira issues ;)  \nvmassol - (21:04): sdumitriu: a big +1 from me to allow any char in attachment names  \nsdumitriu - (21:04): Actually I'll have to check 2087, since it's not about the WYSIWYG  \nvmassol - (21:05): yep and I \u00a0don't like jv's proposal too much  \nvmassol - (21:05): re encodeURI(String) decodeURI(String) in api.Util  \nvmassol - (21:05): I don't understand why we'd need that  \nvmassol - (21:05): btw I've started working a bit on the URL module again this week end  \nvmassol - (21:05): will send a little proposal in a few hours  \nflorinciu left at 22:12 (Ping timeout: 248 seconds  \nvmassol left at 23:03 (Quit: vmassol  \n\n"}
