Look at the top left or right of your screen. Can you see the  **Edit** button?\n\n![EditButtonFlamingo.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/EditingAPage/EditButtonFlamingo.png?rev=1.6)\n\n* If you cannot see the \"Edit\" button, please log in\n\t+ Click on the drawer located at the top right of the page, then click \"Log-in\"\n\t+ Enter your username and password and click on \"Log-in\"\n\t+ If you still cannot see the \"Edit\" button, you may not have the right to edit that page. Sorry! You will need to ask your wiki admin for permissions.\n* If you can see the \"Edit\" button, this means you are allowed to make changes to this page. Let's go!\n\t+ Click the \"Edit\" button\n\t+ XWiki 12.3+\u00a0\u00a0In-place editing will allow you to edit the title and the content of the wiki page while remaining in view mode, with the added advantage of not losing the context. The in-place section editing will help you edit a section without having to scroll the page.\n\t+ If a new page opens in your browser, you\u2019re probably using an older version of XWiki where you can only edit pages in standalone mode. The content of the page is displayed in a rich text editor (sometimes called a WYSIWYG editor, meaning \"What You See Is What You Get\") or a source editor using [XWiki syntax](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/). You can switch back and forth between the two modes.\n\t+ Use the editor to modify content. If you're not sure what to change, find a typo or grammatical error and fix it ;-)\n\t+ Once you're done with your modifications, you can enter a note under \"Add Summary...\" explaining what you changed. Then choose a button at the bottom to \"Save & Continue\" (save your work as a new version but keep editing), \"Save & View\" or \"Preview\" (only in standalone mode).\n* After you save the page, the new version featuring your edit will be online right away! Well done :-)\n\nYou can use a wiki for [a wide range of purposes](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/WhatCanAWikiBeUsedFor). They offer a great way to put content online and share it with others.\u00a0\n\nGet started right now! Hunt the typo hidden in this page in order to edit and correct it!\n\n# The importance of links\n\nOne of the main strengths of a wiki is that you can easily create links between pages. Easy link creation lets you create a structure within your wiki and cross-reference pages. Links make content easier to browse and find. This is why it is important to create links between your pages. To create new inter-wiki links when editing a page:\n\n* In rich text editing mode (WYSIWYG), highlight the word(s) you want to link, click on the \"link\" button, then click on the \u201cPage\u201d button and choose the page you want to link to from the tree, click \u201cSelect\u201d, then click \u201cOK\u201d\n* In source editing mode, use one of the options explained in the [XWiki syntax guide](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/)\n\n**Next: [Step 3 Page History](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/PageHistory)**\n\n\n"}
