Silly message  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:04): It didn't appear the first time I tried so whatever broke it was before that.  \nbblfish - (21:04): I suppose we'll see with time what that was  \nbblfish - (21:04): So clearly I am sure there's a lot of different places one could place the cert creation button  \nbblfish - (21:05): but the certs have to be displayed on that page  \nKermitTheFragger left at 21:06 (Quit: Leaving  \nbblfish - (21:06): One should also add a cert delation form for those who don't want to delete the objects in their home page  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:06): I was just looking at the key in firefox, it says it's good for signing.  \nbblfish - (21:06): yes, I suppose it is. Is that a problem  \nbblfish - (21:07): ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:07): That's good IMO.  \nbblfish - (21:07): :-)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:08): When an application is imported, the importer gets their name put on it.  \nbblfish - (21:08): Now the nice thing about that cert, is that you could use it on any site that accepts foaf+ssl - if it was not a localhost server  \nbblfish - (21:09): you should find the subject alternative name be your WebId  \nbblfish - (21:09): in the cert  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:10): I followed the address in the user profile, I didn't see a link to a test page.  \nbblfish - (21:10): ah yes, we should add that  \nbblfish - (21:10): I just wrote a page up for that today....  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:11): cool.  \nbblfish - (21:11): http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf%2Bssl/RelyingParties  \nbblfish - (21:11): so not sure where best to put that link  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:12): Yes it works!  \nbblfish - (21:12): IT works?  \nbblfish - (21:12): it should not  \nbblfish - (21:12): :-)  \nbblfish - (21:12): since your WebId is localhost...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:12): Well it said the name of the key I gave it.  \nbblfish - (21:13): ah ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:13): It did say my webid was 127.0.0.1  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:13): Was I looking at an error message?  \nbblfish - (21:13): what service did you use?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:14): https://foaf.me/simpleLogin.php  \nbblfish - (21:14): ok  \nbblfish - (21:14): yes, it will show you your web id in your cert  \nbblfish - (21:14): and the server won't be able to fetch your profile page  \nbblfish - (21:14): so it won't be able to authenticate you  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:14): Oh yea, not logged in.  \nbblfish - (21:15): but if you put it outside on the xwiki public server it should work  \nbblfish - (21:15): you'll need to create a new profile  \nbblfish - (21:15): the profile contains RDFa html markup  \nbblfish - (21:15): that describes your public key  \nbblfish - (21:16): and you  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:16): I see.  \nbblfish - (21:17): so the next thing I'll write when it's out there is a login component for xwiki, so people can create accounts in one click on your server  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:17): So website a trusts website b and lets in their users.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:17): ?  \nbblfish - (21:18): you get someone's WebId and info they tell you about them  \nbblfish - (21:18): at their webid  \nbblfish - (21:18): now from there you can do fund things  \nbblfish - (21:18): like have a foaf:Group on the web that lists all its members  \nbblfish - (21:19): and then give write access control to parts of the Wiki to all members of that group  \nbblfish - (21:19): (so they may never have used Xwiki, but whent they arrive they immediately get access  \nbblfish - (21:19): )  \nbblfish - (21:20): or you could say, all friends of my friends can write comments on my blogs without my checking  \nbblfish - (21:20): and your server would just check your foaf file for friend info, and crawl your friends for their webid  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:20): I like that part.  \nbblfish - (21:21): s/for their webid/for their friends webid/  \nbblfish - (21:21): so it's really wide open space to explore  \nbblfish - (21:22): that's why Tim Berners Lee mentioned it today \u00a0http://www.w3.org/2010/Talks/0303-socialcloud-tbl/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:22): Can it be used for starting encrypted connections without exchanging public keys?  \nbblfish - (21:23): I think so: you can say I trust someone identified by a WebId  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:24): ie: make new connections inherit strength from old connections.  \nbblfish - (21:24): the public keys are fetched  \nbblfish - (21:24): from the webid in the cert  \nbblfish - (21:24): I'll have to think about that  \nbblfish - (21:25): so https does a key exchange, and your cert contains a public key  \nbblfish - (21:25): so there is a public key exchange going on  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:25): But if the public key is fetched using an older foaf+ssl connection, then we get strength inheritance.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:26): Are the public keys stored locally?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:26): (By the server)  \nbblfish - (21:26): the cert is in your browser  \nbblfish - (21:26): and the public key in your profile  \nbblfish - (21:26): if you look at the object view you will see a public key there  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:27): If the server caches all of the public keys it downloads then we have strength inheritance.  \nbblfish - (21:27): which server? There may be a few ...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:28): The server which fetches the public key from the profile when connecting to the user.  \nbblfish - (21:28): the reason for having muliple keys on your profile is so that you can have a cert per browser  \nbblfish - (21:28): ah ok  \nbblfish - (21:29): well if it cached the association of the public key to your webid  \nbblfish - (21:29): then that will make it faster for it to recognise you the next time you logon  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:30): True, and the servers can have their own foaf keys and use the encryption when fetching keys for users.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:30): Then there is no place for a man in the middle attack.  \nbblfish - (21:30): exactly. the server can also have its webid  \nbblfish - (21:30): yes, really the home page should be behind https  \nbblfish - (21:31): but, I would not have got a lot of bonus points from vmassol if I had asked him to put xwiki behind ssl  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:32): :) I tried to get in through https, you get the wiki farm manager, figured I shouldn't be there.  \nbblfish - (21:33): ? that's difficult to parse  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:33): which part?  \nbblfish - (21:33): the whole sentence  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:33): I tried https://xwiki.org  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:33): and I was routed to a page for global administration.  \nbblfish - (21:34): oh it is behind https  \nbblfish - (21:34): or there is aredirect  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:35): no redirect.  \nbblfish - (21:35): no the page I land on is http:  \nbblfish - (21:35): precisely http://www.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Home/WebHome  \nbblfish - (21:36): but the https server does not have a CA signed certificate I think  \nbblfish - (21:36): because my browser asked me for something  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:36): Expired.  \nbblfish - (21:36): ah ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:36): In the old days everyone just self signed.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:37): (except banks)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:37): Now browsers make a fuss.  \nbblfish - (21:37): yes, if that gets fixed we could give people https:// web ids  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:37): Would it work for the webid to be a redirect?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:37): So you can move your webid.  \nbblfish - (21:38): that would work, and would be a godo way to test implementations  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:38): Or port to https  \nbblfish - (21:39): port what to https?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:39): The server which supplies the public keys.  \nbblfish - (21:39): the redirect would be a good way of starting out  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:40): Those are 2048 bit keys?  \nbblfish - (21:40): I think you can choose ur strngth  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:40): I picked \"high\"  \nbblfish - (21:41): is that what it says? If so that's probably what it is  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:42): I was thinking maybe a better name would by \"High Security - RSA-2048\" to tell crypto nerds what it is.  \nbblfish - (21:42): you can't change what the browser says there  \nbblfish - (21:42): I think  \nbblfish - (21:42): html5 has made it official now the <keygen> element  \nbblfish - (21:43): in opera you get a huge choice  \nbblfish - (21:43): of strengths  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:43): I see, I thought you made that form up yourself.  \nbblfish - (21:43): Safari client side certs are broken  \nbblfish - (21:43): no it's part of the browser  \nbblfish - (21:43): well the keystrnegh bit  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:43): so is safari java applet loading :)  \nbblfish - (21:44): Safari makes the keys ok  \nbblfish - (21:45): but it forces the requestor to ask for the client certificate in a mode so that if the client does not have a cert, the server has to refuse access  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:45): I see.  \nbblfish - (21:45): that's becuae they have put the ssl stack in the OS  \nbblfish - (21:45): I am told  \nbblfish - (21:46): and are having trouble getting hold of it from the app  \nbblfish - (21:46): It's a big mess as far as the UI goes  \nbblfish - (21:46): sadly  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:46): re applet loading: http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=2577 \u00a0(short story is arbitrary code execution at root level)  \nbblfish - (21:46): so it's openid for them until they fix it  \nbblfish - (21:47): oh thianks  \nbblfish - (21:48): Oh that's old I thought it was a new patch  \nbblfish - (21:48): CalebJamesDeLisl -- So you think that's good enough to put on incubator?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:49): I think so.  \nbblfish - (21:49): cool  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:49): There was a vote email and I think it passed.  \nbblfish - (21:49): yes, but that was before peopel saw it  \nbblfish - (21:49): this is better  \nbblfish - (21:49): :-)  \nbblfish - (21:50): ok, going to go have dinner  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:50): See ya later.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:50): Nice code.  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 21:55  \nvmassol left at 23:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmflorea left at 23:30 (Quit: Leaving.  \nanamarias left at 23:50 (Quit: anamarias  \n\n"}
