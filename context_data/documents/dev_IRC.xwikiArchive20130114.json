I merged my work ( http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8687 ) in 4.4.1 but tmortagne thinks \u00a0the rest of the fix is a bit dangerous for 4.4.1 .  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well sburjan` marked 4.4 as not recommended because of XWIKI-8252  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we need to release a 4.4.1  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if we want 4.4.1 to be recommended I guess we would need it  \n10:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I personally think the life time of 4.4.1 will be short anyway  \n10:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll leave my commit then. We'll see after tmortagne fixes XWIKI-8252 is the fix is good for 4.4.1  \n10:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0It's not like XWIKI-8252 was a regression so IMO it's far from blocker for 4.4.1 and what's required to finish XWIKI-8252 it too dangerous for 4.4.1 IMO (need to jingle with previous and next XAR pages as a whole so it's a big change for the XAR install)  \n11:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0what I did for XWIKI-8687 helps a bit (reduces the number of merge conflicts) if the upgrade is from a recent version. But the number of merge conflicts is greater as the version is older (I tested with 2.7.2 and I got many merge conflicts. 3.x is probably better)  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: blocker means that because of this DM cannot be used in production  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not because of a regression)  \n11:09\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:52\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0Should we include XWIKI-8686 (which fixes XE-539) in 4.4.1?  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: I don't think it's needed for 4.4.1, I don't know your fix well enough yet to judge the risk  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any risk?  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reason I don't think it's needed is because 4.5 is going to be out real soon  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now if there's no risk we might as well add it but it's a call to make  \n12:00\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0vmassol: I would say there is no risk with this patch.  \n12:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0good morning everybody  \n12:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I have 2 questions about the VM creation (I want to commit today ir tomorrow) I will resurrect the thread on the devlist and I'll ask my questions there  \n12:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n12:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0no, I see that since the repo is created with the name xwiki-enterprise-vagrant, I don't have those questions anymore.
