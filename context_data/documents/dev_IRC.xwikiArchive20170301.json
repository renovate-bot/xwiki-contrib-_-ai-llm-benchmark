Today, I install a new xwiki behind a naughty proxy/FW (with white list). Could you tell me web site I must allow to go through my proxy to install/upgrade xwiki/extensions?

That's the simplest  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Option 2: Add a DocumentSheetBinding xobject to your profile page and then edit in wiki mode the content and it'll be displayed.

 \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's an extension that is supposed to support the LTS which is 8.4.4 currently  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok using ck 1.12  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and 1.0.1 for templates  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I hope we haven't added any more deps....  \n14:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you means more contrib extensions as dependencies to XE ?  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not XE  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<artifactId>xwiki-platform-distribution-flavor</artifactId>  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand, xwiki-platform-distribution-flavor does not depend on any contrib extension  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those come with XE  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: \u00a0see https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/flavor-xwikiorg/blob/master/flavor-xwikiorg-subwiki/pom.xml  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we add stuff to the platform distribution  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie to the base flavor)  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we add == the xwiki.org flavor adds  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I know that but what I said is that those are XE dependencies, not platform dependencies  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then we're talking about the same things probably  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't want the full XE deps though  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex we don't include tour  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or blog)  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok taking the risk, going to release now  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO this xwiki.org flavor is too painful to maintain, it would really be much simpler to just use XE and make sure it can be configuredfor our need (make the search go to main wiki instead of current wiki, etc)  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes for sure  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO this xwiki.org flavor is too painful to maintain, it would really be much simpler to just use XE and make sure it can be configuredfor our needs (make the search go to main wiki instead of current wiki, etc)  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0without blog, etc  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we already decide to move blog as contrib extension AFAIK  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm xwikipreferences is hard, let's hope it hasn't changed  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it'll be in the KB flavor  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same as tour  \n15:03\u00a0<flyingpot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<flyingpot>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oooops  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry guys  \n18:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0party :)  \n19:11\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:13\u00a0<flyingpot>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:31\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<sumedhN>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<flyingpot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<Pedro12909\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:11\u00a0<Pedro12909\\_>\u00a0Hello!  \n20:12\u00a0<Pedro12909\\_>\u00a0I just saw your organization on the GSoC website and I thought It seems an interesting organization to colaborate with  \n20:12\u00a0<Pedro12909\\_>\u00a0However, I don't know If I'm qualified/ready to start helping.
