It's working in Konqueror and Internet Explorer.  \njvdrean - (26/06/2008 12:02): try ctrl + shift + r on the import page  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (26/06/2008 12:02): jvdrean: Works. Thanks.  \nvmassol - (26/06/2008 12:02): jvdrean: another thing to mention in the release notes?  \njvdrean - (26/06/2008 12:03): actually you have to clear your cache to see the new logo too  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (26/06/2008 12:03): looks good. Now it is working. Will play a little.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (26/06/2008 12:04): One thing: \"Show the available categories\" is underlined (the text on the button). On other buttons, this is not the case...  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (26/06/2008 12:06): Nice work. Seems more user-friendly than the old one.  \nvmassol - (26/06/2008 12:06): jvdrean: on the home page of XE we have a link to http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Panels/PanelWizard?forceLeftPanels=1&forceRightPanels=1 but it doesn't display very nicely (look at the title for ex)  \nvmassol - (26/06/2008 12:07): I guess we have the same link on the Panels.webHome page too  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (26/06/2008 12:07): If I click on a new category after displaying them with \"Show the available categories\", the new page gets loaded and the categories are not shown anymore. Is this an expected behaviour?  \nvmassol - (26/06/2008 12:07): jvdrean: on Panels.WebHome it's a link to http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/admin/Panels/PanelWizard which doesn't go to the panel wizard page  \nvmassol - (26/06/2008 12:07): \\_steffen\\_: yes  \nvmassol - (26/06/2008 12:08): you don't like it? it's to have the full space for displaying the category data  \n\n"}
