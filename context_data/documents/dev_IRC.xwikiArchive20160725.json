 \n16:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Mr tmortagne, do you happen to know what happens if you call parseContent() and oldRendering is not currently installed ?  \n16:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0does it return to you what you gave it or does it throw ?  \n16:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm asking because of this: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/objects/classes/DBListClass.java#L316  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/internal/render/DefaultOldRendering.java#L185  \n16:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok so just shove everything through velocity and call it a day  \n16:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0btw there was a performance optimization done in OldRendering by Lukasz which scanned for $ and # and it skipped velocity execution if they were not there  \n16:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0he implemented it because he did some profiling and found that (for whatever reason) oldRendering was hot  \n16:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0might be a good idea to reimplement it here since there are all these weird calls to parseContent() in places one does not expect  \n16:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0IIRC he proved that his patch improved perf because we didn't believe that scanning for # and $ is faster than letting velocity do it  \n16:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if there is call to parseContent remaining they should be replaced  \n16:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Also not to waste your time but what was the logic of returning \"\" on error rather than the original content ?  \n16:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0velocity usually has a garbage-in-garbage-out approach to bad syntax and this will make query debugging a bit more annoying  \n16:57\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0is now known as <evalica>  \n16:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: I can't tell you that, this logic is older than my time  \n16:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok got it  \n17:03\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n17:11\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hi, a silly question: in my velocity code I have a hashMap like this:  \n17:11\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0{\"MyKey\":\"Value\",\"AnotherOne\":\"ValueTwo\"} and I didn't manage to sort it  \n17:11\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I tested #set ($MySortedMap = $collectionstool.getSortedMap() ) without success  \n17:11\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Any idea?  \n17:11\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0(I build my hashMap)  \n17:12\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I don't get why you would want to sort a map?  \n17:12\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Maybe what you want is only sort the keys?  \n17:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0hey hi woshilapin :) how's life?  \n17:12\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0to reorder a glossary  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n17:12\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Hi vmassol :-)  \n17:13\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I thought Map was a kind of structure unsort by nature  \n17:13\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I read some entries in a doc, put them in a hashmap to reorder them  \n17:13\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0But then, I'll probably need to read a bit more if there is SortedMap :-)  \n17:14\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ScriptingDocumentation/?url=http:%2F%2Fnexus.xwiki.org%2Fnexus%2Fservice%2Flocal%2Frepositories%2Fpublic%2Farchive%2Forg%2Fxwiki%2Fcommons%2Fxwiki-commons-velocity%2F7.4.2%2Fxwiki-commons-velocity-7.4.2-javadoc.jar%2F!%2Forg%2Fxwiki%2Fvelocity%2Ftools%2FCollectionsTool.html%23getSortedMap%28%29  \n17:15\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yep, I'm discovering that  \n17:15\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Thanks  \n17:15\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I didn't manage to use http://velocity.apache.org/tools/devel/apidocs/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/SortTool.html neither  \n17:16\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0because it seems that sorttools didn't sorting by keay name  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: see http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SortedMap/  \n17:17\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0wow the bot is angry becasue my question  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/Main/SortedMap/WebHome?editor=wiki  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SortedMap/?viewer=code  \n17:18\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0thxs Vincent  \n17:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Indeed, was not straightforward how to use it  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0really?  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0getSortedMap returns a sorted map instance  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't sort  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since you don't pass anything to it, it cannot sort anywyay ;))  \n17:20\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0It seem it is what I did  \n17:20\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yep, that's usually not what I expect from a method called getSortedMap(), more from a newSortedMap()  \n17:20\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0but if I put some entries, it must be sorted  \n17:20\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0But maybe it's only me :-)  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah \"get\" is not the best term  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that it has the advantage that you can write:  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$collectiontools.sortedMap  \n17:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Ah yes, Velocity!  \n17:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0IMO maps should preserve order that things were added - which stands to reason you should be able to sort them like lists  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's LinkedHashMap cjd  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but not HashMap)  \n17:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if you don't make that guarantee then you have indeterminent execution if you expose to the developer any kind of API like iterate over keys or keySet()  \n17:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n17:31\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Thxs both it seem it's working (I did a research all day to simply sort this hash map) \u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SortedMap/test2  \n17:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:51\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0Hello: Has anyone noticed an issue with 8.2 and CKEditor? Using the jetty zipfile, it's not possible to edit any pages: I get a spinning ball forever.  \n19:52\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0The raw wiki syntax editor does work.  \n19:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0mbuschman: can you try clearing your browser cache?  \n19:52\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0Good idea.  \n19:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(force clear)  \n19:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n19:56\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0Yep, caching problem. I went to another browser. Just set up 8.2, Cache from 8.1 was causing the issue.

I've got about...  \n19:59\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0....600 lines of python...  \n19:59\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0hahah :)  \n19:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/MediaWiki/MediaWiki+XML/  \n19:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n19:59\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0Wow, this is REALLY good timing.  \n20:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's quite new so we're eager to get feedback about it  \n20:00\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0I put in 14 hours yesterday getting the last bits of the syntax conversion right, uploading attachments...  \n20:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops sorry :)  \n20:00\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0I mean, the timing is funny, but I'm glad that it's not just me and my crazy python code.  \n20:00\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0Frankly, the timing is amazing; I'm glad CKEditor is now available in a stable release.  \n20:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup that should please our users  \n20:01\u00a0<mbuschman>\u00a0Very much so; the copy/paste feature is awesome. I've got a few users who want to copy/paste images for documenting workflows, so that's incredibly useful.  \n20:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be great if you can provide feedback on the list after you play with it more.
