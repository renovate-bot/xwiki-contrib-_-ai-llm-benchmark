In the mean time you should download XWiki Enterprise, play with it and then setup your work environment, see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome  \n07:36\u00a0<+florinciu>\u00a0just to make sure, you need to have two mails in your inbox. one titled \"confirm <code>\" and another one titled 'Welcome to the \"devs\" mailing list'  \n07:36\u00a0<+florinciu>\u00a0if you have both of them it means your side of the registration is fine. otherwise something else is wrong and you shoudk check with vmassol  \n07:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: I remembered why it's advanced install and not advanced search  \n07:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0because it goes directly to install confirmation?  \n07:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since it's supposed to be able to resolve an extension in a repository that's not searchable  \n07:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You can't search yet in maven.xwiki.org  \n07:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So this is the only way of getting hold of, say, the php rendering macro  \n07:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, but we can trick the user into thinking that is an advanced search  \n07:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I want to ajaxify the install, so want to have the same display for extension coming both from searchable repos and non-searchable repos  \n07:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sure, I agree  \n07:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0do we need the confirmation for install?  \n07:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Just that you'll have to be sure you call resolve when it's an \"advanced\" search  \n07:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n07:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'd say yes, since at this step XWiki tries at least to check that all the pieces are in place  \n07:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Otherwise you'll just get an error later on  \n07:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n07:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Most package managers do this  \n07:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0\"here's what I'm about to install, continue?\"  \n07:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n07:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Going to bed now, bye  \n07:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0just a sec  \n07:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n07:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0K  \n07:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0now, I'll have to implement the progress bar. ofc, the easiest is to pull the server for the job status at short time intervals. Is there any js lib that offers server push?  \n07:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0WDYM by \"js lib offers server push\"?  \n07:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The server pushes  \n07:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. like you establish a \"connection\" and whenever the job status changes the server pushes the new status to the client (js)  \n07:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I've been pondering about adding support for server push, continuous connections, comentd and the like  \n07:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But that's not something easy to do right now  \n07:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n07:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since that's servlet 3.0  \n07:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0in this case I'll do the easy way  \n07:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And the initial feeling was that we should postpone that for 5.x  \n07:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n07:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Anything else?  \n07:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0nop, thanks and good night :)  \n07:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Thanks  \n07:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Good luck  \n07:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0;)  \n07:55\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n07:58\u00a0<deepanshum>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:19\u00a0<vikus>\u00a0has quit  \n08:49\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like there is an issue with Design space  \n08:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0they all display blank content  \n08:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I guess someone associated an empty sheet with the class or something like that  \n08:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0was working well just two days ago  \n08:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you broke pretty much all design pages  \n08:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the problem is that the content of thoses design pages is not in a object but right after the include, the sheet is just displaying the informations  \n08:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so now it's all that is displayed...  \n08:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0removing the ClassSheetBinding for now  \n08:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good morning  \n08:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: what did I do?

 \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cache extension == do the same as maven does with the index zip I mean  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we start to have lots of people using the EM it might be a good thing to do  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would provide immediate list of avail extensions  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and a scheduler job could refresh that list regulary (once a day) or we could have a sync button for the user to force a sync  \n10:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well having local index of extensions to search in was my plan at first since that could support anything, has better perf, and allow doing cross server search, but I have been told it was not good for the server statistics...  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n10:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0( https://github.com/tmortagne/xwiki-platform-extension-indexer )  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0users who install stuff would still go to the server  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we would still have stats  \n10:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: ludo wanted search stats  \n10:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no install stats  \n10:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not  \n10:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0know what people are searching  \n10:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/know/knowing/  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but 1) he's not the one deciding for the xwiki.org project alone ;) and 2) we need to tell him what it costs  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think it matters what peple search for  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if they find something they like they'll install it  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that has higher value  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could also have a feedback form  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when they search something locally and don't find it  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we propose to filla textarea to explain what they're looking for and cannot find  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this will give the xwiki.org project information about stuff users want but can't find  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whatever is filled could be posted direclty in a Wanted Extension wiki page on e.x.o  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll ping ludovic  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok I chatted with ludovic  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and he's ok  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all he'd like is to have install stats  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he's ok to not have search stats  \n10:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n10:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: btw it's strange that the search is so slow, it should be fast (e.x.o is doing ok and a REST call without the UI should be super fast), something to investigate when you get some time...  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'm done with the documentation of the new IRC Bot: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/IRC+Bot+Application  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0enjoy :)  \n10:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0do we have the new bot here ? or we have to wait until upgrade ?  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need 4.0M2  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u2026 unfortunately....  \n10:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0gonna be soon then :)  \n10:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I also fixed the Windows issue we had with our tests (I'm sure you saw the commit)  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n10:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so last step is to start excluding tests on IE8  \n10:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'll run test locally until I manage to excude all tests that fail so our build passes on IE8  \n10:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and then I will create a pull request  \n10:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and ofc, create \u00a0a jira issue for this  \n10:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0for the IE8 exclude  \n10:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0only problem I might run into might be the way Selenium reports IE8's version.. if it also takes in consideration the minor versions that might be a problem. Because then I'll have to specify the exact version, which might not be good since other users can have another version of IE8.  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is exactly why I suggested to you to use a regex  \n10:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0exactly :)  \n10:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0If i run into this problem, I'll have to add the regex part. but I need to learn it before, because I never used it before  \n11:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I will use compound annotations because I'll do the same for IE9 and Chrome (when the time comes).. and I'm sure we'll have tests which will have more than one ignored browsers. wdyt ?
