I seem to have schema's in my postgres database after I delete wiki's and I'm on 5.4.4  \n08:57\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0sorry my mistake, the search function still thinks these schema's exist and try to return documents from deleted wiki's  \n09:05\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:06\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n09:06\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:18\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:29\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n09:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:04\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n10:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:56\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n10:59\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n10:59\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:13\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n11:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n11:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0anyone knows why the build is broken?  \n11:56\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:18\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:20\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0Hi all, if I have a groovy class to render a document (getRenderedContent), what's the way to set variables for the rendering? E.g the page to get the content for contains ${name} and the groovy script should set it before rendering  \n12:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:31\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0what I can think of is using xcontext.put(\"name\", value) before rendering and then use \u00a0$xcontext.get(\"name) instead of ${name} ... assuming it is in a velocity macro in the content of the document.
