But the code is already changed in xe 1.4, do we need fix it now?  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 18:06): It will be in 1.5, and maybe 1.4.1 if there will be one  \ndaning - (20/05/2008 18:15): In xe, every blog post have a title, and the doc contain this post have a $title too. Do you think this two title should synchronize?  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 18:17): They should, but it can only be done using an event listener  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 18:17): (done in a proper way)  \ndaning - (20/05/2008 18:21): Can't we just set the doc title as the blog title when user save the blog in inline mode?  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 18:24): Where should that set be?  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 18:24): Becaue I can't find a nice place to put it  \ndaning - (20/05/2008 18:28): I thought $doc.setTitle(\"title\") should work, but I found this shouldn't affect unless add $doc.save() by admin to this page.  \ndaning - (20/05/2008 18:59): hi. How does xwiki export page to pdf? use pof?  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 18:59): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 18:59): fop  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 19:00): See http://xepecnet.environmentalchange.net/xwiki/bin/download/ICT/Export/XWikiExport200805192259.png  \nvmassol\\_ - (20/05/2008 19:01): hehe  \nvmassol\\_ - (20/05/2008 19:01): was going to paste the same ;)  \ndaning - (20/05/2008 19:02): xwiki can't handle chinese when export pdf because fop don't support chinese?  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 19:02): No, it's the font that can't handle chinese  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 19:02): We should bundle a complete font  \ndaning - (20/05/2008 19:03): system font can displayer chinese well. Can we use the system fonts?  \ndaning - (20/05/2008 19:03): Will a complete font \u00a0be too large for xwiki release?  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 19:04): No, we can't use system fonts directly  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 19:05): fop needs to do some custom processing  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 19:05): We could have some code to do that processing when the platform starts, but it would be very platform specific  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 19:06): And the system font usually is MS Arial, which we can absolutely not redistribute  \nsdumitriu - (20/05/2008 19:06): I'm waiting for the final stixfonts release  \ndaning - (20/05/2008 19:11): have to go to sleep. see you tomorrow:)  \n\n"}
