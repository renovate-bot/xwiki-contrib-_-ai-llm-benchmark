 \n14:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: no idea, was it a commit I did ?  \n14:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0does not remember anything like this  \n14:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't remember, nevermind, I'll keep searching  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: that has 2 issues. 1) we still have the script service in rendering which can be accessed and 2) it's costly to parse all references to filter them  \n14:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: search is supposed to be case sensitive from what I know unless you did not properly configured MySQL database  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one solution I can think of would be to have a system to inject the structure  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ideally we'd need the resources module  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(i think)  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I don't say the solution is to filter in that page I'm asking where the multiwiki concept is really required  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: IMO each wiki should only list the links for itself and the main wiki should list all links  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you mean duplicate them ?  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I tough you were talking about link storage  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the same link is broken in several places yes  \n14:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you could do what I do in extension manager  \n14:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is nowhere the notion of wiki in extension manager, I use a generic \"namespace\"  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only problem that remains is the parsing of the links found but we could use a generic resolver and have platform bring another one  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to extract the namespace)  \n14:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another soltuion is to introduce a Reference with a type  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then have a PageReference in platform  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the livetable page would check the type and cast to PageReference  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in PageReference you'd have a getWiki()  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i think this is our ResourceReference idea  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not exactly  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in ResourceReference you have information about the target  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you want information about the source where the link is  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. you want to know where the broken link is  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0source where the link is is itself a ResourceRefrence  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not yet  \n14:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's just a string identifier in the XDOM currently I think  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes in Rendering ResourceReference has a reference field and it's a string  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we would need to have EntityReference a subclass of a more primitive type  \n14:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or implementing thing in platform  \n14:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/thing/this/  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this = ?

 \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0NamespaceResolver or something like that  \n15:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I never had the need to extract the namespace from a string  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be implemented at the level of the rendering api  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in LinkBlock  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mean LinkBlock could return an object having the namespace already extracted  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie in ResourceReference  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure if it's useful or not  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it would mean 2 parsing\u2026.  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one for the namespace and another one when we fully resolve the link reference  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when we render)  \n15:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not sure, I would prefer doing something for linkchecker for now I think  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0too many stuff in the pipe to think carefuly about introducing something like that  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to think more about it in general  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm the script service will not be able to return only links for the currnet namespace anyway since there's no notion of current namespace there....  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the script service would need to move to platform for that  \n15:09\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* ref69f8d\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-extension/xwiki-platform-extension-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/AddExtensions.xml :\u000f Fix HTML markup. - http://git.io/JrcCTQ  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless I invent a NamespaceValidator interface...  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(implemented in platform)  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0NamespaceFilter rather than validator  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the default impl would consider everything ok)  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all this is pretty complex....  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only alternative is to move it all to platform  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but then people using our rendering only cannot benefit from it\u2026 it's a choice....  \n15:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0moving all this to platform sounds the easiest for now, we can always move back later when all is ready, we have this more generic than that in platform  \n15:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/this/things/  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah I'm still hesitating  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it also means removing something that we made available in 3.3)  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the good point is that the linkchecker is optional  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not active by default  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so only the sysadmin can decide to activate it  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(almost)  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least someone with PR  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll add a warning in the RN  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could require farm admin rights to display the \"external links\" tab for now  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'm not going to work on this now but I've created an issue http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XRENDERING-170  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r2207718\u000f \u000f/ (2 files):\u000f Fix access mode. - http://git.io/UWpYRA  \n16:03\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* rc550165\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-rest/src/test/it/org/xwiki/test/rest/WikisResourceTest.java :\u000f XE-1069: Skin and ColorTheme improvements: new colors, gradients, shadows, etc. ...  \n16:19\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* ra3cfaa4\u000f \u000f/ (4 files in 2 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7348: Provide UI to import and syncronise an external extension in the repository - http://git.io/4ZFluw  \n16:33\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I think we should be able to close http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-605 wdyt?
