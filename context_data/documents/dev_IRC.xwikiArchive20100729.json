If I were in charge I would split up core on hudson even though each submodule isn't technically a top level project.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:37): Although it isn't used, hudson is capable of running multiple jobs simultaneously.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:37): Maven3 can do that too for that matter.  \nsylviarusu left at 12:37 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nabusenius - (12:37): yea, would be better I guess, but would it not overload the pc?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:38): Overload?  \nabusenius - (12:38): if you run 4 builds in parallel  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:38): Run out of ram?  \nabusenius - (12:38): it will not be much faster if you just have 1 cpu  \nabusenius - (12:39): this too  \nabusenius - (12:39): and i/o could become a bottleneck too  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:40): Usually adding threads smooths over bottlenecks because the processor can just do something else.  \nabusenius - (12:40): it might help if it would compile and run tests at the same time  \nabusenius - (12:40): tests are more i/o bound and compiling is more cpu bound  \nabusenius - (12:41): but i don't know on what hardware hudson is running  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:41): My system is showing full cpu load and no io while running your test.  \nabusenius - (12:42): well, networking over localhost :)  \nabusenius - (12:43): all data is in cache, so it is only about running velocity and converting strings  \nabusenius - (12:44): junit4 can run tests in parallel  \nabusenius - (12:44): but it is still experimental afaik  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:44): Same with hudson.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:45): all of the load is cpu from java according to top.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:46): Another matter is if it's running in parallel, other jobs can start and finish while this job is running.  \nabusenius - (12:46): right, short tests could execute morre often  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:47): hm Total time: 28 minutes 51 seconds \u00a0\u00a0on a brand new pentium 4.  \nabusenius - (12:47): single core?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:49): yup. Brand new in 2003.  \nabusenius - (12:50): I have core duo, it takes 15 minutes or so  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:50): Pentium 4 is an interesting processor, the arithmetic unit runs at twice clock speed (5.16Ghz) which is why they explode if you overclock them.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:54): If I designed a processor I'd have 2 cores and double clock the registers and have them flip flop between the left core and the right so it appears as a single core at twice the clock speed.  \nsylviarusu1 joined #xwiki at 12:59  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 13:04  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 13:08  \nvmassol left at 13:13 (Client Quit  \nEnygma` left at 13:43 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 13:48  \nDSpair joined #xwiki at 13:59  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 14:04  \nvmassol left at 14:08 (Client Quit  \nDSpair - (14:33): Where do I find the most current JavaDocs for XWiki please?  \narkub joined #xwiki at 14:36  \nabusenius - (14:45): DSpair: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/API  \ntemporalfox joined #xwiki at 15:52  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:08): I think passwd is done \\o/  \nsylviarusu1 left at 16:15 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsylviarusu joined #xwiki at 16:16  \nDSpair left at 16:28 (Quit: Page closed  \nabusenius - (16:30): cool :)  \nabusenius - (16:31): btw, with my local modifications, groovy macro only works if it is signed  \nabusenius - (16:32): but changing the privileged API to require signed content seems to be complicated  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:46): Great. I'm looking at adding x509 encryption.  \nsburjan - (16:48): is there a way to make the xwiki-startup.bat to had a certificate so windows won't see it as a potential threat ?  \nsburjan - (16:49): this would be a good thing (not so important though)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:49): Also thinking I might rename x509 to cms.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:49): sburjan, windows vista saying the code isn't signed?  \nsburjan - (16:50): windows 7  \nsburjan - (16:50): dunno about vista  \nsburjan - (16:50): i'll investigate and come tomorrow with something more documented  \nabusenius - (16:51): imo in windows it is only possible to sign executables  \nabusenius - (16:52): maybe also jars  \nsburjan - (16:52): CalebJamesDeLisl, ; AFAIK athlon and duron were the last CPU's that actually blew up  \nabusenius - (16:52): but definitely not .bat  \nsburjan - (16:53): hmm.. I see  \nsburjan - (16:53): so this is why i get the warning when I try to start xwiki on 7  \nabusenius - (16:53): it probably shows a warning for everything it doesnt know  \nsburjan - (16:53): yeah..  \nsburjan - (16:54): it's the user control access stupidity they put in vista/7  \nabusenius - (16:54): UAC = user annoyance control :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:54): I saw something about signed bat files on google.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:55): Looks like it's hidden in the ntfs metadata because somebody suggested copy to fat32 and back.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:57): re pentium blowing up \"This became known as Sudden Northwood Death Syndrome (SNDS)\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium\\_4#Northwood  \nsylviarusu left at 16:58 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan - (17:05): but why don't we produce an exe file instead of bat ?  \nsburjan - (17:06): yeah, but the cpu fails in time, doesnt blow up  \nsburjan - (17:06): explode  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:12): An exe is a windows specific executable which would have to be written in some language like C++ and compiled, a bat file can just be written and if it ever needs editing it can easily be changed.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:13): That said it might be possible to make a .jar file which launches XWiki. It would also be operating system independent.  \nabusenius - (17:15): in any case, this will not solve win7 warnings unless we actually sign stuff  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:15): athlon chips were actually physically exploding?  \nsburjan - (17:15): yepp  \nsburjan - (17:15): search it on youtube :)  \nsburjan - (17:15): let me see if I can find one  \nabusenius - (17:16): I only saw a video where it burns :)  \nsburjan - (17:17): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG0sGugsv28&feature=related  \nsburjan - (17:17): this one blow up  \nsburjan - (17:17): in the most real meaning of the word :)  \nsburjan - (17:18): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf0VuRG7MN4&feature=related  \nsburjan - (17:18): this one is actually the epic one  \nsylviarusu joined #xwiki at 17:18  \nsylviarusu left at 17:18 (Client Quit  \nsburjan - (17:19): showing how heat can slow down cpu'z  \nabusenius - (17:20): ah, come on, its a fake  \nsburjan - (17:20): dont think so  \nabusenius - (17:20): (the first one)  \nsburjan - (17:20): at \u00a0that time, the mobos didnt have thermal protection  \nsburjan - (17:20): like new ones.. that shut down  \nabusenius - (17:20): its a fire craker under the cpu  \nabusenius - (17:21): it flies away  \nabusenius - (17:21): silicon does not explode  \nabusenius - (17:21): it just burns  \nsburjan - (17:21): yeah, but the CPU isnt made from cermaic stuff ?  \nsburjan - (17:21): and I guess that explodes  \nabusenius - (17:21): no way  \nabusenius - (17:22): it would blow a hole in the mobo then  \nabusenius - (17:22): look at the socket  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:22): The second vid looks real enough, the first one is a joke.  \nabusenius - (17:23): yea, the second one is tomshardware  \nsburjan - (17:23): well...  \nsburjan - (17:23): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG0sGugsv28&feature=related  \nsburjan - (17:23): i;m going :P  \nsburjan - (17:24): there is one you can see mobo blown  \nsburjan - (17:24): you can get your finger through the socket  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:27): This was an interesting story when it broke http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1137478/celeron-overclocked-1ghz  \nlpereira left at 17:28 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:28): 8.20Ghz I seem to recall they had to up the voltage on the motherboard with a potentiometer to get enough juice into it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:29): But since hardware is relatively cheap (compared to refrigeration cooling equipment), overclocking is usually pointless.  \nsylviarusu joined #xwiki at 17:30  \nsylviarusu left at 17:42 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu left at 18:00 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nmflorea left at 18:05 (Quit: Leaving.  \nEnygma` left at 18:08 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nsburjan left at 18:09 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nSvenDowideit left at 18:22 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 18:27  \narkub left at 18:31 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \nSvenDowideit left at 18:36 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 18:41  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 19:43  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:43 (Quit: Leaving  \nasrfel joined #xwiki at 19:51  \nasrfel1 joined #xwiki at 19:56  \nasrfel left at 19:56 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nflorinciu left at 20:00 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nasrfel1 left at 20:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 22:35  \nSvenDowideit left at 22:53 (Excess Flood  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 22:54  \n\n"}
