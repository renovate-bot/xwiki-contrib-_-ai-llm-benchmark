FYI in my work for allowing adding new resource types for URLs, I'm modifying the webjar module and the URL format. Starting today, I'll start implementing your proposal since I need to rewrite the full URL part of the webjar modue  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*module  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK nobody was against it  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and FTR I have progressed well on the feature of registering new resource types, I hope I 'll be able to commit something in not too long  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(now I am at Devoxx starting tomorrow till EOW)  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so probably not before next week  \n11:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: cool!  \n11:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0also, as you`ve probably noticed from the mail, I managed to find a hacky workaround in order to not get blocked on my side until you get to commit :)  \n11:43\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n11:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep seen that, but still...  \n12:29\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:31\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:33\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n12:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: the build is in a really bad shape for about 1 week now. http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-faq-test-tests/1168/testReport/junit/org.xwiki.faq.test.ui/FAQTest/testFAQ/  \n12:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Caused by: org.xwiki.component.manager.ComponentLookupException: Can't find descriptor for the component [role = [interface org.xwiki.rendering.renderer.BlockRenderer] hint = [html/5.0]]  \n12:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I see thanks for the info  \n12:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I tried to do a quick fix it on friday but it was not really effective  \n12:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the failure was also hidden by a different issue the first half of last week, so it was not obvious to notice  \n12:39\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it seems the html5 renderer is not bundle by the packager plugin when we create a minimal test wiki  \n12:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I know I have added it to XE, but that's all  \n12:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0that could explain the problem  \n12:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: this is what I`ve tried on Friday https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/c1c1833eb0e2e109b32c7c1223ae0f4a50970262  \n12:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and since packager depends on flamingo, I was expecting it to get pulled  \n12:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0that was my idea too  \n12:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I'm looking how the xhtml syntax is bundled  \n12:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it is actually used as dependency of many modules  \n12:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0including oldcore  \n12:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't know if it is a good idea to make oldcore depends on html5...  \n12:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0or maybe we only put that dependency in the packager plugin  \n12:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0re dependency to XE, I for one don`t see why we should have it there instead of coming transitively from the flamingo skin  \n12:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0does it work, even if flamingo is not a \"jar\" ?

 \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is 3 pages but the display should either indicate you explicitely the different language or filter the one you see in the current language  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n14:11\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0please report this, I'm just testing and don't know how/where to report  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this wiki doesn't have multilingual enabled  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why you don't see the multiple translations in the UI :)  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I meant in http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?do=viewTag&tag=category01  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally you shouldn't even know there are translations  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt enabling multilingual is going to change anything to this UI  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1: if you wish to report it's on http://jira.xwiki.org. Thanks for letting us know  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@tmortagne with multilingual you should see the 3 flags normally  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in the page itself  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I was answering to xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1 :)  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not in http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?do=viewTag&tag=category01  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was answering to \"okay... \u00a0^^ \u00a0where do I see those translations?\"  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes on the page itself  \n14:13\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0please do somebody of you report it  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1: ok, just forget the problem on your side and know it's a bug  \n14:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0thanks :)  \n14:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0with those settings right now is it possible for me to create a new page and translate it too?  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm that's a good point actually  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you're right and we should enable multilingual on playground  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to showcase translations  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt tmortagne?  \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0probably  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok enabling them now  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should also put a few languages in \"supported languages\"  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed that's a pain  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we cannot say \"all languages\" ;)  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you an copy paste the list from l10n wiki  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is there a way to get the list in a formatted way? :)  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is a formatted way ?  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/inline/Commons/WebHome for example  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0copy/pasting this directly should work  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice that's what I meant  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1: done  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0check http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Sandbox/ now for example  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll see the language list in the top level menu on the right  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when you edit you can chose which transaltion to edit  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm seems there's a bug :(  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can't go back to the default language by using the language menu gdelhumeau/evalica  \n14:21\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0thanks! \u00a0so with multilingual support activated... \u00a0can I click on one of the links in the tag overview and see the corresponding translation?  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau/evalica: this is what i see https://www.evernote.com/shard/s119/sh/0cb807ac-faad-4954-8fc9-7a6abcc3fa27/a750e7537a7ee654988fdfb6a13e8e57  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1: no because that tag page is buggy and the links don't point to the translations  \n14:23\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0okay  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but once it's fixed either you'll see only the current language or all languages (we'll need to decide what's best)  \n14:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Enygma`: either we make the packager plugin install the dependencies of the skins (which is not consistent with the WAR plugin), or either we add the html5 renderer to ther list of mandatory jars of the packager plugin  \n14:24\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0I can't go back to english, only switching between french and german \u00a0(as you said some moments ago)  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes just realized this too ...  \n14:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another bug :)  \n14:24\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0only a dead bug is a good bug :)  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can put language=en in the URL though  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to force it  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n14:25\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0okay :)  \n14:25\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0thanks  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: FTR I've changed the playgroundtemplate but haven't resaved the mysql dump  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(no time right now)  \n14:37\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0probably not a real bug, just a glitch: \u00a0dashboard / activity stream: I click on the area there and I see in detail multiple changes for one page. \u00a0When clicking on the link to that page the details also are shown for a short moment before the page loads. \u00a0it only irritates :)  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1: would be great if you could create an account on jira.xwiki.org to register and then create jira issue so that we don't forget them! :)  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in that way you can be sure the'll be handled and fixed in the future  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would help us a lot!  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you would contribute to the project! :)  \n14:40\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0hehehe.... \u00a0\u00a0only testing right now with some spare time.... \u00a0I was here last week or so, asking for download/wrong link to sandbox and \"register new account\"... \u00a0\u00a0I won't be a regular user  \n14:41\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0but yeah... \u00a0\u00a0heard alot of Jira and always wanted to use that tool \u00a0- so that's seducing ;)  \n14:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: were you previously referring to XWIKI-10881 ?  \n14:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: this issue is about adding a webjars type  \n14:42\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not about a new webjar URL format  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1: hehe :)  \n14:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Enygma`: FYI http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11994  \n14:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: isn`t it implied, as the description explicitly exemplifies?  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes i know there's an example but I think they're 2 separate issues  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least from an impl POV they're completelyt separate  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can do one without the other  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't mind if we change the issue title to say both  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll do both at once anyway  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I thought it would be more clear  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to have 2 issues  \n14:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: aha, so the skin was handled specially (using a default if none specified) but then it was ignored when resolving transitive dependencies  \n14:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: ok  \n14:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Enygma`: not really.

\n15:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I mean it is not a public API  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0two things here cjd, first accessing directly config without going through a Configuration component is not our best practice (but this is oldcore\u2026) and second calling split(\u2026) in velocity code is not nice at all  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(yells some missing api)  \n15:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm, for me the use of getXWikiPreference('languages') is somewhat annoying because 'languages' is a magic word which represents hidden API...  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't like that we expose directly the config to scripting  \n15:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the split thing.. well everyone's gotta learn regex sooner or later :P  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean everyone's got to get bitten by regex sooner or later  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0...  \n15:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you can write bugs in any language  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure and regex is \u00a0know to be the best language for writing stuff  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*known  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0best as in the language you make the least errors in...  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's good to have everyone try their luck whenever they need tthe list of languages  \n15:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0regex can allow you to write hilariously brittle code if you are not careful... but that's not reason to shun it, it's a pretty powerful tool  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you're out of scope here  \n15:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0scope? this is velocity  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the discussion is not about whether people need to learn regex or not  \n15:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok <trollface> (it's mandatory here)  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's about providing an api to get the list of supported languages  \n15:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, providing a list would be nice  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that whenever you need that list you don't have to compute it by hand  \n15:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but given the API they had, I'd say the author did the right thing  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would have been fine for a contributor yes  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0less fine for a core dev  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well it's kind of a \"perfect be the enemy of the good\" / \"pick your battles\" dicsussion  \n15:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you can't always have the API which matches your need, sometimes the API is downright broken  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no it's the kind of a perfect way to write code on the log run, you need refactoring  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thats what refactoring is for cjd  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/log/long  \n15:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, I faced the issue, every feature I wanted to implement eventually required \"rewrite oldcore\"  \n15:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0aka \"nothing can get done\"  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh I forgot you were a binary person, sorry :)  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's either all or nothing with you  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and sure it's downright impossible to provide this api without rewriting the whole oldcore  \n15:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm not making a personal attack, also not up for strawmaning, just that I've written a pretty good amount of code with my nose plugged because the feature needed to ship  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's fine we all have to ship under pressure and no time  \n15:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0XWIKI-11997  \n15:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I usually try to encircle the bad code and cut it off from everything else a little at a time, then one day I can sneek up on it and kill it :)  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but here we 're building for the long run so at least 1) you create a jira issue, 2) you discuss it, 3) you write a comment in the code to show others you know something is not right, 4) you tell yourself you're going to add that api whenever you next have some time  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0etc  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I'm not making an attack on guillaume  \n15:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a03) is hard, people write what they see and when they're learning it's difficult to blame them  \n15:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0s/people/contributors/  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm just saying we should fix this and we shouldn't rpomote this as the right now  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/now/way  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you see split() in velocity code you know there's an api issue :)  \n15:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0note though that your sequence is missing a 5)  \n15:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's old, it was in colibri too: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/templates/global.vm#L62-62  \n16:15\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:17\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0hi, would it be possible to link in a page to a local ressource (hard disc, local network drive)  \n16:17\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi, yes  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4: you can use a file:/// URL or a UNC URL  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax#HLinks and especially the section below named \"XWiki Syntax 2.1 Link Specification  \n16:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0thank you!  \n16:24\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0hmm, the link seems to look fine, but it's not working... \u00a0\u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Sandbox/TestPage1 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0clicking on it does nothing  \n16:24\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0using \u00a0file:///T:/ \u00a0\u00a0directly in my browser works fine though  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well that's lucky!  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0imagine if you could access what's on the playground.xwiki.org server!  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my bad  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is executed in your browser  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now since this is a security issue you need to tell your browser to allow it  \n16:29\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0well, typing it in my browser works fine, clicking it does nothing, not even opening a new tab \u00a0(Firefox 37.0.1 here)  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can google it  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to allow it  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again this is a security concern  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's normal the browser will not execute content \u00a0coming from the internet on your local machine  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0without you telling it explicitely :)  \n16:30\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0okay.... \u00a0reading at mozillas site now... thanks for pointing this out  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: new webjar URL scheme implemented, now need to finish the rest...  \n16:32\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0thx
