By looking at the build manager roster I'd say it is Sergiu's or Jerome's turn, unless someone else volunteers  \n10:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0both of them are offline though  \n10:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0would be nice if it was Sergiu since he broke some validation tests ;)  \n10:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n10:43\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0otherwise, from those online, jvdrean has never been the build manager (he might be busy though?)  \n10:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Sergiu was earlier on Skype but now it's offline there too  \n10:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not a good sign for today :)  \n10:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0we might have to wait for him until afternoon (european time)  \n11:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I have an issue with the sheet management module I'm working on. I have a component that gives me the list of sheets \"registered\" for a document or a class. The component methods take document references as input, and so they \"query\" the saved document, i.e. the one from the database/cache. I also changed edit.vm template to check if there is a sheet available (using the component I just mentioned). It works file.  \n11:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0The problem is only when I try to create a document, i.e. a blog post. Because the document is not saved my component doesn't detect the BlogPostClass object and so it fails to find a sheet.  \n11:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the only acceptable solution I have so far is to explicitly add the sheet to the edit url (for the create form). I can get the sheet from the same component, giving the BlogPostClass doc reference  \n11:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so instead of just:  \n11:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0/edit/Blog/MyNewBlogPost?template=Blog.BlogPostTemplate  \n11:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0we'll have to use:  \n11:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0/edit/Blog/MyNewBlogPost?template=Blog.BlogPostTemplate&sheet=Blog.BlogPostSheet  \n11:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm IMO the issue if that your component does not support provided document  \n11:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n11:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that would be the cleanest IMO  \n11:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0couldn't you have also a method that takes a document ? added to the one that takes a reference  \n11:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but until we have the new model in place.. I can't use XWikiDocument as param of a component interface  \n11:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can use it's bridge representation  \n11:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm  \n11:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0XWikiDocument implements some interface just for that, don't remember \u00a0its exact name  \n11:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not super clean but better that depending on old core  \n11:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0DocumentModelBridge I think  \n11:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0now the issue if that it's not that simple to acces the XWikiDocument object in a template  \n11:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, that's the best option for the moment  \n11:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since that requires PR  \n11:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ah  \n11:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I would need to get a DocumentModelBridge from a api.Document  \n11:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but  \n11:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0an idea would be to make Document implements DocumentModelBridge maybe  \n11:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm  \n11:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0what about passing api.Document to the script service, which gets the XWikiDocument and passed DocumentModelBridge to the real sheet management component?  \n11:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anything that manipulate Document has the same PR issue, the only way for the script service would be to access it using reflexion  \n11:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(but it's doable)  \n11:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0right  \n11:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0at least it's quicker than making Document implements DocumentModelBridge  \n11:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n11:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0at least it's the right directly I think (directly providing the document instead of the reference), you could to the reflexion solution as a first version maybe and lets decide later if we want to improve it  \n11:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you are in platform anyway so it's not like its was dangerous to use reflexion  \n11:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, the other solution is, as I said, to explicitly specify the sheet in the URL, but it's a bit too much to ask from the app devs  \n11:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea the less the better  \n11:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we have the information it's just a matter of API, would be a shame to force to duplicate it in the URL  \n11:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep, the information is already in the attached object, but I can't access it because I'm looking at the unsaved document  \n11:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0s/unsaved/saved  \n11:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'll use api.Document in script service  \n11:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0thanks Thomas  \n11:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but that's because you are looking at the database but you do have the information in the context so from external POV you have everything you need  \n11:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0np  \n11:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n11:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'll write a mail on devs though, in case someone has a better idea  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: yep always better  \n13:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:26\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n13:26\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:31\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:34\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0in the 3.1 XE standard, the QuickLinks panel comes up with tags bounding it as a velocity macro. In the XEM, there are no such tags. AIUI Velocity is the default where programming rights aren't required. I'm observing different behavior in the two versions. Why is that?  \n13:35\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0i.e. editing the QuickLinks panel  \n13:35\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0(XEM SA 3.1)  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0JuanDaugherty: XEM or XEM 3.1 should be exactly the same for tags. Only difference between both are: application and wiki manager plugins and some pages  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah one thing to know though  \n13:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in XEM a user needs to have programming rights at the farm level to have programming rights on a given wiki  \n13:40\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0ah.
