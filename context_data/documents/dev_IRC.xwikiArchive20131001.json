I remember discussing this on this irc channel  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I was told that the right way was not to do pull but merge  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying it now  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I mean doing pull on master, then checkout your branch and merge master  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case \"git merge master\" merge your local master branch with your current branch  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so if you did not fetched or pulled before then yes you did not merged the last version of master  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed, I think i did a pull on master but not sure  \n17:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my master is usually quite up to date but if this change was very recent it's possible I didn't have it  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess you can do things like \"git merge origin/master\" (bu still need a fetch I think)  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've just done this on the branch;  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0git pull origin master  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it crated a new commit but it seems empty  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure directly doing a pull on a branch is very clean  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0better be safe and pull only corresponding branches I think  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow this is a mess, just done a git checkout master and now I have tons of changes on my master...  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha platform build fail on packager plugin, since it moved to 5.3-SNAPSHOT probably as usual  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: looks like your last commit on feature-resource-and-wiki-modules is a merge or several commits from master in one  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, but you made changes to master in the meantime, so I don't know exactly what happened. I'm rebuilding, i'll see how it goes  \n17:26\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:57\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:03\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:25\u00a0<Slash\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:27\u00a0<Slash\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:09\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:01\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:08\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:42\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n23:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:43\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:56\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit\n"}
