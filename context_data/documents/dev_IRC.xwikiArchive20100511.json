I'm getting java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space with a large xar. Maven has -Xmx1024m  \nsdumitriu - (15:16): Better look at the plugin documentation  \nsdumitriu - (15:16): Ah, it's our plugin  \nmflorea - (15:16): yep :)  \nsdumitriu - (15:17): So there's no documentation  \nmflorea - (15:17): I'd have to look through the code  \ntmortagne - (15:20): the best would probably be to improve the plugin to not load the entire package before saving it  \nmflorea - (15:21): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-tools/trunk/xwiki-packager-plugin/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/tool/backup/ImportMojo.java nothing useful in the mojo. But, is the packager plugin executed in a forked process or in the same process as maven?  \ntmortagne - (15:21): should be the same process as maven  \nmflorea - (15:22): then it should inherit the -Xmx from maven process  \ntmortagne - (15:22): yes i think it should  \nmflorea - (15:22): the xar has 6.5MB  \nmflorea - (15:22): 1024MB should be enough..  \nmflorea - (15:23): -Xmx1024m  \ntmortagne - (15:23): Iyes it should probablt be enough  \ntmortagne - (15:23): try 2048 just to see if that change anything but it sound too much to me  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:33): you could run top and look at the java process to see if it's really running up to 1024m before bombing out.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:33): My gesss is it's not.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:33): guess  \nmflorea - (15:35): the system has 2048MB RAM..
