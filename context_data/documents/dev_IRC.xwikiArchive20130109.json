XWIKI-8274  \n17:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Hello everybody. I have found an issue when building my XAR project. This could be some issue on platform since 4.1.4. Here you have my pom.xml \u00a0http://pastebin.com/67VeDkNy from my maven project. If I use 4.1.4 it works, but if I use 4.2 or 4.3 it fails. Maybe an artefact wasn't deployed on maven repo ?  \n17:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I have the maven-enforcer plugin failing with the message [WARNING] Rule 0: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.RequirePluginVersions failed with message:  \n17:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Some plugins are missing valid versions:(SNAPSHOT are not allowed )  \n17:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Best Practice is to always define plugin versions!. But as you can see, I am using hardcoded version without any SNAPSHOT in my pom.xml  \n17:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has anybody any idea about this ? I can build it ok with 4.1.4, so this does not block me. But this might be important to be known  \n17:28\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: I'll look at it  \n17:47\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:00\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: thanks  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:55\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:22\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:18\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:25\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:57\u00a0<Nam1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:57\u00a0<Nam1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n23:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
