I guess that is a known issue ....  \n11:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm doesn't ring a bell  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ClemensR)  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: yes I think it's because watchlist hasn't been installed on some subwikis  \n11:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I better test locally, but e.g. Icannot place http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DocGuide on my watchlist .... ah, thats why  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because of the not perfect custom XAR extension used in xwiki.org  \n11:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, that explains it ...  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I fixed it in some wikis, all it need is installing watchlist extension usually  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking dev  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should be ok on dev now  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you have the issue on other wikis just install watchlist ui 6.2.2  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0working on fixing InvitationTets now  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok foudn the problem  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0err not yet ;)  \n11:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, works now, thanks :)  \n11:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n14:08\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<Rick\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:20\u00a0<Rick\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\_cjd: hi  \n14:25\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0good afternoon  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any idea why in InvitationConfig we have a SMTP config instead of using the wiki config?  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I added some config options to the general smtp config  \n14:26\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0we probably had a desire to allow invitations to be sent through a different smtpd  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0really?  \n14:26\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0anyway it falls back on the default iirc  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm by default it's filled with some values  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe there's a flag to tell it to use it or not  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rying to find the code that sends email  \n14:27\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0in retrospect it seems like silly over-design, but one never knows in advance what will  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0InvitationCommon probably, checking  \n14:27\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0either that or WebHome  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0inded I see that in webhome: #sendMail($messages, $config, $emailContainer)  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the macro is defined inwbehome too  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I've seen the logic  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so since there are default values  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the general ones won't be used  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for server and port  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway, I think it needs to be removed in the future and we should use the new mail sender api  \n14:31\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0sounds logical  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i'd rather add the ability to define several mail configurations in the generic mail config  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and provide an id for the various configs  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rather than have extensions redefine all the params  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if we need several configs)  \n14:32\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0I don't think it's realistic to have multiple servers, it was just something that \"sounded important\" in the heat of the moment  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which I didn't take into accout as a use case when I did the new mail sender api  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0created XWIKI-11577 to rememerb it  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found the problem, fixing  \n14:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: tests should be fixed now  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry for not noticing earlier  \n15:05\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys several the jobs for 6.3 are fialing on ci, should we just remove the 6.3 branch?  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same question for 6.2.x branch  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if we don't plan to release another 6.2.x  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt we want to release 6.3.1 (even if there is a few blockers fixed)  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a06.2.x we should probably keep as a safety till we release 6.4 and till 6.4 is proven stable  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but 6.3.x I think we could remove it now  \n15:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n15:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0just started a build of xwiki-platform, since due to the jenkins instability that was just fixed, the latest 2 commits on platform were not built  \n16:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0can I commit?  \n16:04\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Enygma`?  \n16:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m planning to release.
