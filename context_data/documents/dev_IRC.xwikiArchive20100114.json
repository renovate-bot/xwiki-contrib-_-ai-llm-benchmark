I don't have the format in head. Thomas has though.  \narkub left at 09:10 (Read error: 113 (No route to host)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:11): [Vincent Massol] reading and trying to understand  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:11): [mflorea] the last comment in not necessarily about the format but about whether we using the cannonical class name for enum constants or the rendering.macro... prefix  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:12): [Vincent Massol] I don't understand what this means  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:12): [Vincent Massol] what enum constant?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:12): [mflorea] a macro parameter type can be an enum  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:12): [mflorea] and the enum constant must be translated on the UI  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:12): [Vincent Massol] ah ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:13): [Vincent Massol] I don't understand the first alternative  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:14): [Vincent Massol] the first alternative would mean not following the rule defined right?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:14): [mflorea] well, if an enum is used for multiple macro parameters (maybe for different macros) then it would be better to translated just once, using the full class name as traslation key prefix.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:15): [mflorea] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:15): [Vincent Massol] sure but it would still be macro parmaeter related  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:15): [mflorea] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:15): [Vincent Massol] so I don't understand why you wouldn't have the agreed prefix  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:16): [Vincent Massol] ie rendering.macro...  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:16): [Vincent Massol] something like  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:17): [Vincent Massol] rendering.macro.parameter.<enum somehow>  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:17): [Vincent Massol] anyway I haven't thought enough about this and this is really thomas' domain  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:17): [mflorea] yes, but the question is more general, for the new localization component, shouldn't we have a strategy for localizing enums. Or each application uses its own keys for enums  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:17): [Vincent Massol] so I prefer to have his opninion  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:17): [Vincent Massol] I do agree on one point  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:17): [Vincent Massol] that we shouldn't retranslate the same key over and over  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [Vincent Massol] but I don't know enough about macro enum  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [Vincent Massol] are they defined and used only for a given macro?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [Vincent Massol] or for several macros?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [mflorea] I don't know :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [Vincent Massol] do we have examples of macroe nums?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:19): [mflorea] I'll ping thomas when he logs in  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [mflorea] yes, for include macro  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [mflorea] for the context parameter  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [Vincent Massol] ok so indeed it's specific to the macro in this example  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [mflorea] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [Vincent Massol] so I guess it's true for all macro enums in general  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:20): [Vincent Massol] so I'd be for your second option  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] the likelihood that a given macro enum is reused is low and in this case we can retranslate  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] actually  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] if you remember  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [mflorea] ok, I'll go on with the second option. I'll ask thomas his opinion when he logs in  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] we have propsed a solution for this  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] a generic solution  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] with translation symbolic links  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] I don't recall the details but thomas would remember  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] something like  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:21): [Vincent Massol] my.key = @refferencetoanotherkey  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:22): [mflorea] that would be cool, that's no possible with standard Java message resources, right?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:22): [Vincent Massol] right  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:22): [Vincent Massol] (at least I'm not aware of it)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:23): [mflorea] ok, thanks a lot, I'll go on with my implementation  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:24): I'm going to be adding a few pieces of text for the captcha implementation, how should I go about making them translatable?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:25): I had heard that the ApplicationResources.properties system was going to be replaced.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:25): [Vincent Massol] Caleb: not quite  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:25): [Vincent Massol] it's supposed to be for core translations only  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [Vincent Massol] and all applications should have their own translations  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [Vincent Massol] (to be separated from the core)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [Vincent Massol] but I don't recall any discussion to remove it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:26): So it works like the components.txt file?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [Vincent Massol] we do have a new module to handle transaltion though (but it's not ready yet)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [Vincent Massol] it's in xwiki-localization/  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:26): [Vincent Massol] caleb: no  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] well, what do you mean by \"it\"?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] it = for applications?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] it = for core code?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] for applications it's called documenrt resource bundles  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:27): it = ApplicationResources.properties  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] this one works like properties file  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] java properties file  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] loaded by a java Resource Bundle  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:27): [Vincent Massol] currently by MessageTool  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:28): [Vincent Massol] in the future by the xwiki-localization/ module  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:28): Ok, all of the translations are in the xar side so it sounds like document resource bundles will work fine.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:28): [Vincent Massol] XWikiMessageTool \u00a0that is  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:28): [Vincent Massol] caleb: only for applications  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [Vincent Massol] for core stuff it would remain properties file  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [Vincent Massol] document resource bundle already exist  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [Vincent Massol] it's even documented here:  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [Vincent Massol] http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/InternationalizingApplications  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [Vincent Massol] the only problem currently is that  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [Vincent Massol] it requires modifying XWikiPreferences to register a new translation page  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:29): [Vincent Massol] we want to change that  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:30): [Vincent Massol] to make it work exactly like wiki macros  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:30): I wrote the captcha implementation so that getting the image, the html and the submit form is an application.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:30): [Vincent Massol] ie with some Translation object  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:30): [Vincent Massol] and when such an object is added to a doc  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:30): It sounds like it will work fine.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:30): [Cindy Mitchell] eesh. Jabber, quit changing my damn name.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:30): [Cindy Mitchell] lol  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:30): [Vincent Massol] then this doc is automatically registered as a doc resource bundle  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:30): [Vincent Massol] applciation?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:31): [Cindy Mitchell] Vincent Massol: do I change nicknames every so often? lol.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:31): [Vincent Massol] well yes app is correct. I was just wondering how do you plug it in  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Vincent Massol] so that it gets used in comments, registration, etc  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Vincent Massol] since we don't have IX yet  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Vincent Massol] hardcoded?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Vincent Massol] with some if to test if the app is present?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:32): I was thinking of getting hold of the application using includeForm  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [Vincent Massol] note that this is what we do for now  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [Vincent Massol] (till we have IX)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [Vincent Massol] what we do = hardcode the call with an if  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [Vincent Massol] ie if the app is installed then it's not used and if it's installed it becomes used  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [Vincent Massol] (in other words it must not fail if the app isn't there)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:33): I see.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:34): Thanks, I have some reading to do :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [Vincent Massol] so we need to release today  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [Vincent Massol] the import is still failing though  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [Vincent Massol] checking hudson  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Vincent Massol] hmm X11 server missing on hudson  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [Vincent Massol] Caleb: are you using jcaptcha 2?.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:44): No, I can't find it in any maven repo.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [Vincent Massol] hmmm  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [Vincent Massol] we had done some tests with jcatpcha1 and decided not to use it because the quality of the captchas were not good enough  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [Vincent Massol] basically in our tests 50% of people failed to recognize the captchas :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Vincent Massol] something like this (from the top of my head)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:45): I signed up to their list so I'll ask if they know of one.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Vincent Massol] but the images generated by jcaptcha2 were good I think  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Vincent Massol] fyi the author of jcaptcha is a good friend of mine  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Vincent Massol] if you need info or help let me now  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Vincent Massol] I'll ask him on twitter ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:45): You can pull strings to get us access to the secret maven repo :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:46): [Vincent Massol] caleb: do you have the binary?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:46): [Vincent Massol] because we can easily put it in our own repo if we don't find a public one  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:47): I didn't bother getting it because I couldn't find a repository.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Vincent Massol] twitted  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Vincent Massol] I don't see it on http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcaptcha/files/  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:48): [Vincent Massol] looks pretty dead, I'll talk to him  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:51): [Vincent Massol] just sent an email with you in copy  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:54): [Vincent Massol] mflorea: http://www.google.fr/search?hl=en&q=\"java.lang.NoSuchFieldError:+fFeatures\"&btnG=Search&aq=f&oq=  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:55): [mflorea] thanks, so it's about jar conflict  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:55): [Vincent Massol] I don't know  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:55): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:55): [mflorea] I think so, between our jars and the web container jars  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 10:06  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 10:56  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:00): [Oana] guys, what's the difference between the hooks: <!-- com.xpn.xwiki.plugin.skinx.JsSkinFileExtensionPlugin -->  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:00): [Oana] \u00a0and <!-- com.xpn.xwiki.plugin.skinx.JsSkinExtensionPlugin -->  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:00): [Oana] ?
