Create a page with just a velocity macro and put only an empty html macro inside. SaveAndContinue works and the page can be viewed. SaveAndView throws a velocity macro error which won't go away when refreshing the page.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:33): http://tinypaste.com/907a9  \nsdumitriu - (01:34): Strange  \nsdumitriu - (01:35): Works for me  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:39): That is strange. I'm testing on a selenium test which I stalled. I'll try on my postgres installation.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:42): Yup, works (no bug) on the postgres installation which is a little older. I'll upgrade and test again.  \nsdumitriu - (01:43): Testing on 2.2 final  \nsdumitriu - (01:43): WIth HSQL  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (01:46): 2.3 rev 27150 HQSL (selenium)  \nbblfish left at 03:03 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 03:07  \noxi - (04:27): I fail to compile a \"watch\" snapshot  \noxi - (04:27): is there a compiled snapshot download available?  \nsdumitriu - (04:27): Let me check  \noxi - (04:28): I followed the instructions  \nsdumitriu - (04:28): http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-distribution-hsqldb/  \noxi - (04:28): however, I don't want to dig deeper into this right now  \noxi - (04:28): thanks a lot!  \noxi - (04:28): this should work with the current Enterprise Version?  \nsdumitriu - (04:30): Yes  \noxi - (04:30): perfect  \noxi - (04:30): this is confusing me: xwiki-watch-distribution-hsqldb-2.2-.......  \noxi - (04:30): I'm using Apache Derby, not HSQLDB  \nsdumitriu - (04:31): Never mind that  \noxi - (04:31): good  \nsdumitriu - (04:31): This is a full watch \u00a0build  \nsdumitriu - (04:31): You'll have to extract the required jars from it and move them to your running Enterprise  \noxi - (04:35): sdumitriu: only extract wabapps/xwiki from the zip?  \noxi - (04:35): and it doesn't matter that it came with jetty and I'm using tomcat?  \nsdumitriu - (04:35): Not the whole webapps/xwiki  \nsdumitriu - (04:36): Just the jars required by Watch, from webapps/xwiki/WEB-INF/libs  \noxi - (04:36): there is no xar file available, right?  \noxi - (04:36): how do I know which ones are required?  \nsdumitriu - (04:37): http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-wikis-watch/  \nsdumitriu - (04:37): Sorry, I'm sleepy, lucaa will be able to help you more once she wakes up  \noxi - (04:39): ...  \noxi - (04:41): so I guess lib/xwiki-watch-gwt-client-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar; lib/xwiki-watch-gwt-server-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar; gwt-servlet-1.5.3.jar  \nsdumitriu - (04:42): gwt-servlet should be there already  \nsdumitriu - (04:42): A more recent version  \noxi - (04:42): true, gwt-servlet-2.0.0.jar  \noxi - (04:44): which xar file can I use?  \noxi - (04:44): there's no xar file in http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-wikis-watch/  \nsdumitriu - (04:46): Yes there is  \nsdumitriu - (04:47): http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-watch-wikis-watch/1.1-SNAPSHOT/xwiki-watch-wikis-watch-1.1-20090923.093231-2.xar  \noxi - (04:51): thanks  \noxi - (04:52): I copied xwiki-watch-gwt-client-1.1-20090923.09321-2.jar and xwiki-watch-gwt-server-1.1-20090923.09321-2.jar to my WEB-INF/lib  \noxi - (04:53): Do I also need gwt-user.jar and gwt-dev.jar from gwt-2.0.2.zip?  \noxi - (04:54): I guess I can safely replace gwt-servlet.2.0.0.jar with gwt-servlet.2.0.2.jar  \noxi - (04:56): what do you think about gwt-user-2.0.2.jar and gwt-dev-2.0.2.jar  \noxi - (04:56): do I need them?  \noxi - (04:58): should I delete the gwt-user-2.0.2.jar/javax/servlet classpath to prevent a collision with tomcat's servlet api?  \noxi - (05:07): should I import the xar using \"import package\" in xwiki enterprise?

I'd have no time to implement it for a while though.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:09): correction: to suppress htmlheader the line would be #set($display = {startpage : {htmlheader : false}})  \nsdumitriu - (22:10): Hm...  \nsdumitriu - (22:10): That is an interesting idea  \nsdumitriu - (22:10): But hard to introduce now  \nsdumitriu - (22:11): Since all the skins and templates depend on the current flow  \nsdumitriu - (22:11): And this is not a problem for the official skins, but for all the customized instances  \nsdumitriu - (22:11): Thus, it would make upgrades harder  \nsdumitriu - (22:12): But yes, we need a way to exclude some elements from the rendered page  \nvmassol left at 22:14 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:14): Good point about messing up custom skins.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 22:26  \nmflorea left at 22:26 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol left at 22:36 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 23:04  \nflaviusolaru1 left at 23:06 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 23:31  \njvdrean left at 23:50 (Quit: Leaving.  \n\n"}
