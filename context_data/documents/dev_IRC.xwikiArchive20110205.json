I think I succeed to install it correctly but I'm stuck at the last stop : how to link the xwiki tomcat instance with apache ? In fact I would really want to be able to access localhost:8088/xwiki through http://wiki.mydomain.com but I didn't find any help to configure the apache virtualhost and I'm really not used to Java webapp :/ . Any he  \n12:00\u00a0<trivol>\u00a0would be very appreciate :) Thanks  \n12:49\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:51\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0for those of the open / free software fans that cannot attend the fosdem (where some of us are right now), it seems some of the talks are streamed: http://fosdem.org/2011/demand-streaming enjoy!  \n13:21\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:21\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0trivol: I understand correctly that you are trying to get apache to forward to xwiki?  \n14:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think this might be what you are looking for: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-4.1-doc/proxy-howto.html  \n14:20\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:26\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:29\u00a0<trivol>\u00a0exactly :) thx a lot  \n14:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n14:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:35\u00a0<trivol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:30\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:54\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:10\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n19:13\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:21\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n21:16\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Is there an ETA on return of maven.xwiki.org?  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tomorrow  \n21:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0thanks  \n21:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tomorrow morning  \n21:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0What happened to it? It looks pretty bad since it doesn't ping.  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we're transferring it to another machine (but it wasn't announced which is strange - I need to tell the guy doing it)  \n21:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I see.  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0apparently a machine is down  \n21:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Got a patch to remove jcrstore xwiki-core -= 2700 lines :D  \n21:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n21:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Was cleaner than I expected too.  \n21:51\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a02700 lines for a module we never used ?  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was supposed to be used!  \n21:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Not really a module but yes.  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but artem stopped participating in the xwiki project  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0before we completely finished it  \n21:52\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I imagined it only whould involve removing some classes from CORE  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wasn't far from finishing  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nobody continued his work unfortunately  \n21:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0porting xwiki to jcr == pushing an elephent up the stairs.  \n21:53\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0and will the final package be smaller ? Or some perf improvements ?  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0perf?  \n21:53\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0performance  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know what perf is  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n21:54\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0\"\\_  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but why would it be more performant  \n21:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I imagine it will cut 50-100kb off the size of the .war file.  \n21:54\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but I guess if that code wasn't never used ... it's irreleent  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not going to change the overall size  \n21:54\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0irrelevant  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not significantly)  \n21:54\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I thought it would make xwiki faster in some way :P  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what changes the overall size is the size of the deps we use  \n21:55\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0that's good also  \n21:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Actually, the classes were loaded so it will save a few nanoseconds of class loading time.  \n21:55\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0also this :)  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: that said we can maybe remove some hjackrabbit jars?  \n21:55\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0make sure we remove all deps from pom files :)  \n21:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The query plugin makes a lot of use of jackrabbit unfortunately.  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but I think there were a few deps only for this but I may be wrong  \n21:56\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I still can't figure how our product has almost 100MB .. it's huge  \n21:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0AFAICT it's also using jcr classes for hibernate queries.  \n21:57\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0lots of deps jars  \n21:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but that's wayyyy better than having to rewrite and support our own code  \n21:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0How long should we keep the query plugin around?  \n21:57\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0is there any way to see if we have deps we don't use in our xwiki ?  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: not long IMO  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we had a thread on it on the list  \n21:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't remember the exact outcome though  \n21:58\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Great :) That's holding up a lot of cleaning in xwiki-core.  \n21:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It is exposed through some c.x.x.api.\\* calls which will have to go through the deprecation parade.  \n21:59\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wow we need to remove the warnings from the console, lots of them now  \n22:00\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0hello, anyone know why a new install of xwiki 2.7 would only allow xwiki 1.0 syntax from wiki editor?  \n22:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0caused by sergiu's com.xpn.xwiki.api.XWiki.getXMLEncoded deprecation  \n22:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grantk: is this an upgrade?  \n22:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's a pure new install with provided config files and provided XAR there's no reason  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's an upgrade you need to upgrade the XAR and especially the document information panel  \n22:01\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0vmassol: It has been a few weeks since I installed, just got working with ModJK today so was looking again, hold on and let me check  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can also check the xwiki.cfg file  \n22:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the supported syntax listed there  \n22:02\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0vmassol, I did not do an upgrade, fresh install, I did have some config changes to make for db, ldap and glassfish so I will check it out there.  \n22:03\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0grantk: did you switched to 2.0 or 2.1 syntax on the right pane ?  \n22:04\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0sburjan: I was trying to do that because I was getting some funky results with a {{code}} tag and saw that 1.0 was the only option listed  \n22:04\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes, then you must do what vmassol said  \n22:04\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0xwiki.cfg file  \n22:05\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0\u00a0xwiki.rendering.syntaxes = xwiki/1.0, xwiki/2.0  \n22:05\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0looks like 2.0 is enabled to me  \n22:05\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0see if you can enable 2.0 from WYSIWYG editor  \n22:06\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0sburjan: Not available from wysiwig either  \n22:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grantk: then the only potential isssue is that you're using an old Document Information Panel  \n22:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0try import the default XAR again, you can try just to import Panel.DocumentInformation  \n22:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/import/importing/  \n22:07\u00a0<grantk>\u00a0vmassol: ok I will give that a shot.  \n22:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Perhaps the .xar file is not the newest version?
