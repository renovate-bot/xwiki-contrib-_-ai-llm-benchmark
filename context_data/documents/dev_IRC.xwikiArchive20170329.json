 \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reports  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that should work fine  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing  \n10:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in meeting)  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should work  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in \u00a0a submodule it generates  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<url>http://extensions.xwiki.org?id=org.xwiki.contrib.blog:application-blog-ui:9.4-SNAPSHOT:::/application-blog-ui</url>  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I had the following in the root pom:  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<url>http://extensions.xwiki.org?id=${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}:::</url>  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we could make a page on xwiki.org somewher to do the source redirect  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt tmortagne ? worh it?  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt tmortagne ? worth it?  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another option is to define a <property> in Maven  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{extensionrepository}.  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and have the <scm> part in the parent pom in a generic way, using this property  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's really much simpler to just use master branch URL  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure except nobody does and we have plenty of broken sources everywhere  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really, many extension have the right URL  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really, many extensions have the right URL  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you think there's nothing to improve  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fine  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you agree with the <scm> approach above though?  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's simple)  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand your example  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hold on  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the URL you used is the URL that lead to the extension page  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not github  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not so easy to find the github URL from the extension id  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://gist.github.com/vmassol/38684a939bcf5484a718cc76872b6cfb  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I've updated it)  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually xwiki.scm could be replaced by xwiki.repo.name  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or xwiki.scm.name  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure you can provide property for scm if you want  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki.github.repoName  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes the property should contain github in its name IMO  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki.repoName  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since it's specific to github  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless we want to be independent of github  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would also work with a differnet scm type  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the github id so it cannot really be independent from it  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the top location of the sources  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would work with cvs, subversion, etc  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but fine it's a detail  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're quite linked to github anyway  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not so sure the release plugin will like to have the <scm> in the parent pom  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since it modify it  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good point  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would prbably not work  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0need to be checked  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think that's why I did not do it like I did for jira last time  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't think I tested  \n11:26\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:51\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, we've moved our xwiki install from tomcat to jetty, I've copied over the pernament dir too but now the DW shows up after login \u00a0?  \n11:53\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0hi \u00a0tmortagne do you have an idea ?  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: appart from the permanent dir not being where you think it should be no  \n11:54\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, agree  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0by \"jetty\" you mean you setup jetty yourself or you use the jett/hsqldb XWiki package ?  \n11:55\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0jetty by itself  \n11:55\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0standlaone  \n11:56\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I think I understand  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then you should double check the permanent dir setup in xwiki.properties I guess  \n12:01\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0thanks tmortagne , \" I've copied over the pernament dir too\" => I was wrong.  \n12:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n12:02\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0just created an empty dir instead.....  \n12:12\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0we'll see if it fixes that session stealing issue ...  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems we have a blocker: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14134 (not very important but still bloker since it's likely a regression)  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm already on another blocker so if someone could have a look that would be rgeat  \n13:00\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Hi vmassol , Can Angularjs be used while developing the glossary application? I think it is easy to use and more advanced than plain javascript.  \n13:05\u00a0<simfir>\u00a0has quit  \n13:05\u00a0<simfir>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sgc072: we use jquery in XWiki so it would be nicer to use that if you need to write javascript  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0angularjs is also nice when you have full UIs  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but here it won't be the case  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm planning to implement the ESCAPE thing using a Query Filter. I'm adding the capability to \"filter\" query parameters to QueryFilter. We can then decide later if we want to have this filter on by default or not. Sounds good to you?  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure, QueryFilter should probably be given a chance to filter the whole Query  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed, I'm adding default Map<String, Object> filterNamedParameters(Map<String, Object> namedParameters) \u00a0and Map<Integer, Object> filterPositionalParameters(Map<Integer, Object> positionalParameters) but I guess I could introduce instead a more generic: default Query filter(Query query)... And in this case we could deprecate filterStatement() too  \n14:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0need a big more that that since there is no setStatement in Query  \n14:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0need a bit more that that since there is no setStatement in Query  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's ok  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could construct a new DefaultQuery() or some other class  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or some WrappingQuery  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that we would introdsuce  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that we would introduce  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that only the part that you wish can be overridden  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0new WrappingQuery(...)  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wrappingQuery.setStatement(...)  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WrappingQuery would act as a helper  \n15:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:21\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n15:21\u00a0<acotiuga1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:25\u00a0<SotoX3[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<SotoX3[m]>\u00a0Hello, Is there a way to make the navigation panel visible to an unregistered user?  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0SotoX3: that's the default  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the nav panel shows the doc that the user has permissions to see  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/doc/docs  \n15:48\u00a0<SotoX3[m]>\u00a0Okay, so maybe I just haven't defined which docs unregistered users can see yet?  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes probably  \n15:50\u00a0<SotoX3[m]>\u00a0Great, I checked in the rights section and made the fix.
