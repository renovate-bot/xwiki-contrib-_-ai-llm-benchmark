(cache files cannot be loaded -> for example /xwiki/resources/js/xwiki/wysiwyg/xwe/5325D2FACA7E85486F7CD221A0800472.cache.html is missing)  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good morning everyone  \n10:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, when can we plan the 5.4.4 release?  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see there's one issue open: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10225  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be nice to plan the 5.4.4 sometime this week  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: would be avail to release it?  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/would/would you/  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we could do the release tomorrow?  \n10:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0as soon as there is no issues  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: seems that http://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/Bug+Fixing+Day+58 is not published yet  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed, I wrote it and wanted to wait until noon and forgot about it  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0done thanks  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: when you closed all the lucene-related issues, did you make sure that they were not valid for SOLR too? Becuase if they are we should move them to the SOLR search instead of closing them IMO  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they were not valid for SOLR  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway I need to open then back since we can't get rid of Lucence plugin right now  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think you need to reopen them, we can still mark the lucene plugin as deprecated/retired  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(even if it's not moved yet)  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you checked how complex it is to rewrite the rest part that uses lucene?  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that we don't have any search api  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I guess we need to tie it to an impl ...  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not just that, we don't have any way to access the SOLR search through REST right now so we need that also before getting rid of Lucene one  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no internal API?  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for searching)  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0java calls  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(instead of REST)  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we are talking about a REST API here  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue is that nobody can do a SOLR search through REST API in XWiki  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes ok but that's something else  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the fact that ther is a java API does not change much  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's different from the Server REST API I guess  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since that one is implemented  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it proxies to the underlying search  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no?  \n11:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm talking about default SOLR module which is using embedded SOLR  \n11:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we can't just answer \"no REST unless you use separated SOLR server\"  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought the search REST API was in the rest-server module  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0rest-server does not depend on SOLR so I doubt that and that would be very bad anyway, rest-server should not depend on the whole word. We need a separated module which come with the REST API for SOLR  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the mistake has been done for Lucene and now it's a pain to get rid of it...  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok it's in WikiSearchQueryResourceImpl  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which calls searchQuery  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which verifies which impl is in use  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DB, LUCENE, etc  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucene, xwql, hql actually  \n11:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see it that hard to add an swtich for the SOLR query manager dialect  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/dialect/query language  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc this means creating some aspect to \"unplug\" the lucene support  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because we have to stop doing this crap... also SOLR already define a REsT API and we should expose that instead  \n11:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so your idea is to remove the Search feature from the rest-server module  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and intsead have each search module (solr, etc) offer its Search REST API  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which seems logical)  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes, you have to know already what module you are using anyway because you indicate it as parameter...  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I agree  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now changing this is not a small feat if we don't want to break backward compat  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is there a default if not parameter is passed?  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess it's lucene  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we can deprecated it, it's not that hard but what is important is to not continue that for SOLR  \n11:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no default  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you don't pass a parameter you don't get anything  \n11:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you get empty result and not an error which is probably pretty wrong too since you have the feeling the search worked  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually seems there's no default  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and no search is done is no param is passed  \n11:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what I said yes :)  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops gtg, fridge being delivered\u2026 bb in 1 hour\u2026  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0:)  \n11:37\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:24\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:44\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n23:48\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
