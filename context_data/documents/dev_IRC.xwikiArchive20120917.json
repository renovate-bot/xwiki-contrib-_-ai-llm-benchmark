I am getting the XWiki Enterprise - Web details  \n18:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since that's the actually action you are asked to do  \n18:28\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0UI details worked quite well  \n18:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0actually both work well but what I explain in the comment is that XWiki needs to access remote repository to get proper details about the WAR and that it does not do it right away (since technically it's useless and should not block the XWiki startup)  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: it's still wrong to display ${platform.version}  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: the generic code does not really know more at this point without accessing remote repository  \n18:31\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, that is the second screenshot fr. maybe I should have highlighted that, making it easier to see  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I mean is that we need to do somerhing about this  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either hide the button  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we cannot have something wrong  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I did not closed the issue...  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok good  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n18:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I'm just explaining what's happening  \n18:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I was imagining that since I have platform on my local hard drive, I should also be able to see the version  \n18:33\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'm the dumb user here  \n18:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: it's not exactly like that, what the module gets is the pom.xml of the WAR extension but nowere you have the parent of this pom locally so it can't resolve the variable  \n18:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so we need to find a way to get those informations locally  \n18:34\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0didn't knew that  \n18:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the UI is resolved from a remote repository so you get proper informations  \n18:35\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yepp.  \n18:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we should probably not try to display all the informations of the distribution WAR for now, the name/version is enough for the need  \n18:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0exactly what I was thinking now  \n18:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0now I've hit the issue about the merge conflict of XWiki.XWikiPreferences. Which option should I choose to proceed for having a clean install ?  \n18:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0take the new version  \n18:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you get that because XWikiPreference is generated at init  \n18:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you will get the same for several classes  \n18:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all the standards classes basically  \n18:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we know about it but it's a bit tricky to take care of this cleanly so we tough it was ok for M3  \n18:39\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I see  \n18:39\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0thanks for explaining. sorry for being a pita  \n18:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0basically we need to find a way to make Extension Manager aware of theses generated documents  \n18:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: nothing to be sorry of, that's your job  \n18:40\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0what are the side effects of removing the generation from init ?  \n18:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we are not going to do that :)  \n18:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0actually our goal is to make Extension Manager know the standard documents so that it can use them as previous version in a 3 ways merge  \n18:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but this require a bit of refactoring  \n18:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and probably introduce a way for any component to provide this kind of autotically generated document so that both XWiki init and Extension Manager can get the information  \n18:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0makes sense  \n18:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i was imagining that these documents come with the xar import.
