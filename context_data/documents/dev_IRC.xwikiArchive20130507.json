I played a bit with wiki manager and granting all privileges on xwiki user (db) seems strange as it allows this user to access all databases of the server (case of mysql at least). Any good practice on the subject ? (maybe something instead of grant all privileges on \\*.\\* ?)  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bouquetf: hi  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just need to give enough privileges for the xwiki user to be able to create a schema  \n10:13\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0delete may be needed too for deleting a subwiki ?  \n10:13\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0or by default a user who create a database can delete it ?  \n10:14\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0I'll check in mysql documentation but thanks for the info  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes deleting a schema is needed too if you wish to delete a subwiki  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0bouquetf: note that wikimanager also support reusing a database you would create by hand (not not give XWiki too much rights)  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/not not/to not/  \n10:20\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0I did not see this option, I'll check again thx  \n10:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0bouquetf: it's not an option, when you indicate the name of the wiki wikimanager tell you that database already exist and you can force using it  \n10:30\u00a0<huhongbo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: can I create a new wiki on myxwiki.org  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(before you bring it down)  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing it  \n10:33\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0thx tmortagne, it worked as expected  \n10:35\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:35\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0An other question, I've not found a french documentation, I missed it ? Or is there a project I can contribute to ? (I like translating documentations when I learn a new product :))  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bouquetf: no there's no French documentation  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because there are not enough translators to maintain a translation  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can barely maintain the English version already :)  \n10:45\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0I think a french translation of the user documentation may add some business value, maybe as a community project ?  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's not a good idea to create a new wiki on myxwiki.org  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the template wiki hasn't been upgraded  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: it's for sorin testing  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm copying another wiki  \n10:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tdelafosse: where did you came up with Ana Blandiana name ? :)  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: btw I tried to copy the incubator wiki and it failed on some attachment copying  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now trying with another wiki  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some NPE which we need to investigate  \n10:48\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0sburjan : It was Sergiu that wrote that :) Does it have a special meaning ? :)  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: fyi https://gist.github.com/vmassol/5531207  \n10:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tdelafosse, it's a romanian writer :)  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bouquetf: I'm personally not fond of translations because I think they do a disservice to the project  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: looks like empty attachment content or somehting  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or broken attachment  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bouquetf: unless you have a large enough translation community  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that people will arrive on the translation and they will be incomplete and not up to date all the time, giving a bad quality to the project  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be done but it needs to be well done and clear what should be the expectations for someone who arrive there with some big banners, etc :)  \n10:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: generally the solution for that is different community websites  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0instead of various translations on the same website  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, if the sites are different and handled externally it's probably better but you still need to be sure people don't mistake it for the main doc site  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's clean on the community website home page and the adress is not the same (like xwiki.fr) that should not be mistaken  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/clean/clear/  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the community web site will need to have a visible banner to point to the main doc site  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes I agree that's a solution  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so bouquetf if you want to start a French web site for xwiki, you have everyone's blessings :)  \n11:04\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0vmassol: I agree with you for the translations, as we work with xwiki, it may be possible to integrate a clear workflow for translations with change management and so on. May be a nice project for a rampup on xwiki ;)  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[WARN] starting the 5.0.1 in 10 minutes  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*release  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a05.0.1 release started  \n11:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, what was the previous version of myxwiki.org prior to 5.0 final ?

\u00a0I'm following the guide here(http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/BSD\\_Install) and there's an instruction to edit the WEB-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml and I'm still wondering if that's needed.  \n20:55\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0The guide here does NOT mention this: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationPostgreSQL  \n21:00\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0altker128: Yes, it's needed  \n21:01\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0sdumitriu1: Got it, thanks. \u00a0I re-read both pages and I see that the FBSD guide is more detailed but the file needs to be modified anyhow  \n21:02\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0sdumitriu1: The default config is hsqldb , is there any issue using that?  \n21:02\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0If you want to use Postgres, then you can't use HSQLDB  \n21:02\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0HSQLDB is decent, it's actually pretty fast  \n21:02\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0Much faster than all the other  \n21:02\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0s  \n21:03\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0But the default configuration is to store everything in memory  \n21:03\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0So it won't scale well if you plan to put a lot of content in the wiki  \n21:03\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0sdumitriu1: The default config of HSQLDB? \u00a0I'm not beholden to Postgres, but I am setting this up on FBSD  \n21:04\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0You can stick with HSQLDB  \n21:04\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0But then there are a few questions you have to ask yourself:  \n21:05\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0- How big is your data going to be?  \n21:05\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0- How much redundancy do you want to have? There are dedicated tools and lots of guides for setting up backups for mysql and postgresql, but not so much for HSQLDB  \n21:06\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0I'm not saying it's not possible to use HSQLDB for a large or safe database, just that it's harder to find guides for setting that up  \n21:08\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0Gotcha. \u00a0This is for personal use, I don't think the datasets will be huge but I've already done 90% of the setup for PSQL...so might as well just use it  \n23:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
