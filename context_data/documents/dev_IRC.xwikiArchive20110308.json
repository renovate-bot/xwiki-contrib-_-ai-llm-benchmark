 \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's \u00a0failing in web-standard even on hudson  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I've done is that i've enabled the creation of the license files  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only for projects having a src/ directory  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is not perfect but that to prevent it from being executed on the top level pom  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/that/that was/  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my guess is that when run in the reactor in 2.2.1 the directory that is checked  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is the current dir  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not the dir of the module being built  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to find a better way  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but now that we've released license tool  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can fix the top level pom easily  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's not a very good solution  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway it's better than my hack so I'll do that now  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be ok now  \n11:40\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:53\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n12:01\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I see you fixed the build.

 \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0jstoldt: cool that you started looking in the code!  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0very soon you'll be able to contribute patches! :)  \n14:05\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0has quit  \n14:05\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that or i'll spot a neat bullet hole on one side of my head and another messy one on the other ;)  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0nah can't be that bad!  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0re your question  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0was thinking about something related a few hours ago  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I'm started the new rendering web site  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0http://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/  \n14:06\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, for me it is... i am not used to this kind of programming...  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0and we'll need to document the syntaxes on that site I think  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0so we have 2 needs:  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0- document syntaxes there  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0- document syntaxes in XE's help page  \n14:07\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay. so do you just want a bit of copy-pasta going on between the both  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0well the challenge is to not do copy paste  \n14:07\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0or do you have different target groups in mind?  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0ie have a clean spec coming from the rendering/ top level project  \n14:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like help pages, stick to the essential syntax bits  \n14:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and rendering get more technical  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0then augmented by other things coming from the specific rendering part coming from platform/  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0and this notion of image params and server side resizing is platform/ specific  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0it's not in the rendering/ code  \n14:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true...  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0so at some point (now? later?) we'll need to figure out how we document all this  \n14:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah...  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0IMO it's easier for now if we don't go too deep in the details  \n14:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so no server-side resizing for the time being?  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0and start by focusing on the implementation of the new syntax \u00a0design  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0well  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0we could have a special tab on that new design page  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0containing extra stuff  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0the other tabs for paragraphs, tables, images, etc would document only what is in rendering/  \n14:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0new design page? like in rendering.xwiki.org or like in XADMINISTRATION based syntax pages?  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0and that extra tab would contain additional information  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0new design page = the new design proposed by evalica  \n14:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ok, thought so  \n14:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so i'll spare this one for now and complete writing the current specs  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I don't know if that tab idea would fly or not yet. Otherwise we need an extension mechanism  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0which is also possibe  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0possible  \n14:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0after that i'll see if i can make a prototype of the new design  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0to add stuff at the bottom of each section  \n14:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yep  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0mflorea: try doing a dry run  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0\u2014dry-run AFAIR  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0it does the same as real but without the commits  \n14:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm build the entire platform now, I'll try dry run afterwards  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0ok  \n14:32\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0is it okay for me to refer to http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag\\_IMG.asp  \n14:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0?  \n14:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the page is pretty comprehensive but it's also plastered with adds...  \n14:37\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0jstoldt: -1  \n14:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't like w3schools at all  \n14:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0do you have a good alternative?  \n14:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0at hand  \n14:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0preferably one that also includes the standard attributes  \n14:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep  \n14:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0This is the very terse one: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/abstract\\_modules.html#s\\_imagemodule  \n14:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0This is the one with explanations as well: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#h-13.2  \n14:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, the second link looks good  \n14:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0thanks  \n14:43\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: any hints about http://pastebin.com/2gu5be03 ?  \n14:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I've had that locally for a while  \n14:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But it got fixed when updating some parents  \n14:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0My guess is: wrong parent pom  \n14:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0what's strange it that the build works.

We can fix the pom fro 3.0RC1  \n16:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: You mentioned a missing translation, where was it?  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I committed it  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see XE-770  \n16:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0K, didn't get that for on the mails  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I picked the wrong issue to commit probably  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's committed in platform/core  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I attached a screenshot to that issue  \n16:09\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: should we put the macros in a different groupid for group them together nicely: http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/rendering/macros/ for ex?  \n16:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: could be a good idea indeed  \n16:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mflorea: this is what i had in mind: http://paste.codebasehq.com/pastes/351  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm document and the best I can do is: In addition if you plan to use macros you need to [[get the JARs for the macros you want to use>>http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/rendering/]]  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which shows all modules....  \n16:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0WDYT?  \n16:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0another way is to reference extension.xwiki.org instead but it's maybe not always up to date  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I'd need to list them all  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll create a page for that btw  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but this is for the classpath  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n16:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jstoldt: I understoodm but it's not right. As I said these are not generic parameters. Also, quality affects currently only jpeg images. IMO the solution is to pass them in the image URL query string.  \n16:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0how would i do that using xwiki syntax? [[image:my.png?keepAspectRatio=true&quality=0.2||width=\"40\" height=\"30\"]] ?  \n16:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because from a user point of view this is just confusing  \n16:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt: actually there is a parameter for query string  \n16:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, that's right, because the user shouldn't know about these parameters. The fact that the image is resized on the server side is an optimization, which can be disabled. What would say the user if he uses then and they don't work  \n16:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but in 2.1 only i think  \n16:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0tmortagne: does that also work for images?  \n16:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and yeah, if so only in 2.1  \n16:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0pretty sure it's working with images yes  \n16:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mflorea: my point is not if it works for all file types or is disabled or anything like that. my point is that if the need arises users will have to go with either velocity + html macro or parameters in two different notations and although the information obviously becomes redundant if it is parsed as a parameter (is it possible to remove them before creating the XHTML?) it would be benefitial  \n16:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0to have it the same way everywhere within the syntax  \n16:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0besides, i don't really agree with \"users shouldn't know about this or that\"... if a feature is implemented there is a use case scenario and withholding information is not benefiting anyone, imo  \n16:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jstoldt: and my point is that these parameters are not public in the sense that users shouldn't need them. Making them public makes things worse because then users will complain they don't work for (1) external images, (2) images other than jped (3) when the server side image resize plugin is not enabled (4) when image resize is disabled in the xwiki.properties  \n16:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt: about redundant you can't provide query string directly in the reference using 2.1 syntax  \n16:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not for documents at least  \n16:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mflorea: this is where i'd resort to a bit of warning advice but you're the boss  \n16:28\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm not the boss, I just expressed my pov. you can raise this on the mailing list and if people vote for it I'll implement it, but right now I'm -0, close to -1  \n16:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0tmortagne: i know, i meant it would create redundant HTML attributes in the image tag if you'd add ||quality=\"0.7\" to the image syntax  \n16:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0alright, mflorea  \n16:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt: let mflorea finish his release then you can debate with him ;)  \n16:30\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hahaha, okay... i kinda lost track of release procedures now that i don't actually run any XWiki instance any more ;)  \n16:34\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0guys, I get the same result with maven release plugin 2.0 ...  \n16:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0this time it fails even with -DdryRun=true (fortunately, so I don't have to revert again)  \n16:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: In core, right?  \n16:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, platform/core  \n16:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'll give it a look  \n16:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mvn clean install works fine, mvn release: prepare fails  \n16:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Any specific module?  \n16:53\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0does 2.1 syntax allow element attributes starting with \"on\"?  \n16:54\u00a0<gsauthier>\u00a0has quit  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: wdym?  \n16:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0element attributes == (% var=\"value\" %) ?  \n16:55\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0onload, onmouseover, on\\*  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0var can be anything  \n16:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the syntax does not define what are the parameters  \n16:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: no specific module, it fails at the end of release: prepare, when preparing the POMs for the next development iteration  \n16:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it just given as it is to the renderer  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the future, ie syntax 2.1 I'd like to introduce namespaces  \n16:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n16:56\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Might be a good idea to block things starting with \"on\" since they all are used to run script.  \n16:57\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0( disclamer: this was discovered by abusenius )  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oneDay=\"value\"  \n16:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: thats not rendering job, you can always do that with html macros  \n16:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: this is the last part of the console log http://pastebin.com/sD698gMR  \n16:57\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Sure but you can also block html macros (or at least we would like to eventually)  \n16:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you really want to filter that it should be after rendering probably on the produced XHTML  \n16:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it stops at xwiki-core-model but its POM is not different than others  \n16:58\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I suggested post filtering the html output about 6 months ago and got a -1.  \n16:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since you have to parse html anyway because of html macro easier doing it for the whole thing at once  \n16:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: i doubt that  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: when we have namespaces, we'll need to decide if we do a whitelist of allowed params or just blakclist. but in any case it would be easy to block: html:on\\*  \n16:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0depends what you proposed in implementation details  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: we can imagine a configurable blacklist  \n16:59\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0My proposal was a filter which ran after the entire rendering engine with a configurable blacklist.  \n16:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: was talking to cjdelisleactually  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we can do it after fine but it maye be costly  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since you'd need to parse again  \n17:00\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Sed is pretty fast.

I suggested blocking on\\* but then the idea of a post processor was reintroduced (which I like better anyway)  \n17:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/macro/html macro/  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see the need for postprocess in general  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can see the need for html macro post processing  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's related to the macro code  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0html macro code  \n17:06\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0The problem with that approach is you have how many lines of code in the rendering engine? 20k 30k? >30k  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I'd be ok to introduce post processor components fo rthe html macro  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex to prevent <script> to be used, etc  \n17:07\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0And you're certifying that each and every line is secure.  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: I still don't see how you can make that fast  \n17:08\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0how \\_I\\_ would make it fast? Write it in C ;)  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too slow  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0assembly maybe  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:09\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0The reason asm is fast is because it's careful about memory lookups, that is possible in any lowish level language.  \n17:09\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0But seriously... A postprocessor can do just about 11MB/s in java and it could run in it's own thread.  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to count in %  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0% you add on top of the rendering time  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one feature of the rendering is that it has to be fast  \n17:12\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0A postprocessor would also be rendering1.0 compatable.  \n17:14\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Same basic idea as a gzip stream filter. Just that it looks for '<' then 's' or ' ' then 'c' or 'o' etc.  \n17:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0cjdelisle: what does this mean? in the administration application:  \n17:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0This configuration cannot be displayed because it was last edited by Marta who doesn't have permission to edit this page.  \n17:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0?  \n17:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean in the administration panel, in a section which is added though a Configurable  \n17:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(I mean do you know anything about this check?)  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: it's more complex than that  \n17:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Is it on a 3.0 build?  \n17:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0lucaa:  \n17:15\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0The user Marta doesn't have permission to edit XWikiPreferences.  \n17:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sdumitriu: \u00a0it's on incubator  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what if I have <\u2026 onMouse in a code block for ex  \n17:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Then it means that we need to upgrade it  \n17:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0cjdelisle: then how did she edit it and why can't I, as a user that has the right to, edit?  \n17:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0anyway, if it's because of versions incompat, it doesn't matter  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm forget that  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but still you'd need to exclude CDATA sections  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(assuming we generate XHTML)  \n17:17\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Because that configuration page is not the same as XWikiPreferences, you can edit that page and add nasties to it which would be executed in the context of XWikiPreferences.  \n17:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0lucaa: It's caused by the Velo1.7 upgrade  \n17:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's a broken macro  \n17:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sdumitriu: aaaah, delicious  \n17:18\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Oh, right. Not updated.  \n17:19\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0From a set of blacklist and whitelist entries it would be a very simple unidirectional regex engine.  \n17:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0cjdelisle: right. But can't we execute the administration stuff in the context of themselves? Because this is a little odd for me as an admin, to see that I cannot edit some settings because another user, who doesn't have as many rights as me, has edit it before  \n17:20\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean, there are settings, I just want to change the settings  \n17:20\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0as a user I really don't know why changing some settings changed before by another user would be a problem  \n17:20\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe  \n17:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Seriously, state machines are nice  \n17:22\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0This was asked before, the question boiled down to: Do you want each and every user to be allowed to add a section to admin just by creating a Configurable object?  \n17:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but the message I get is in the administration section itself  \n17:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0not in the panel  \n17:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it's about the annotations config  \n17:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I can see the icon in the administration panel, but when I click on it I get that error message  \n17:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I don't see how this prevents adding an administration section  \n17:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0because the section is actually there  \n17:24\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0There should be a mention in the main administration section that it is considered unsafe to show that section.  \n17:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I just cannot do anything in it, although \\_I\\_ am the user with rights  \n17:24\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Was that note removed? sdumitriu ?  \n17:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but if there's a warning and the section is still there, it doesn't fix anything  \n17:25\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean it doesn't help keeping the administration section clean and not messing it up  \n17:25\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Well if we blackhole a section with no warning then it looks like something went horribly wrong and pages are not loading.  \n17:25\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and why is that bad? the fact that any user can create a configurable object  \n17:26\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ah, I think I know  \n17:27\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0If it were changed so that pages executed in their own context (the url is not /XWiki/XWikiPreferences ) when in a section, then it would be safe as the only attack would be to create millions upon millions of configuration sections.  \n17:28\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0ALso there's the $doc.save() trap but that is everywhere.  \n17:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yeah, I get it now  \n17:29\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I suppose it would be a nice addition to add a link to the page and tell the user that if it is safe then it should be saved by a permitted user (them) in order to be displayed.  \n17:30\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Another nice addition is to have a \"default configuration\" document which is loaded when the configuration document is not available thus allowing upgradability.  \n17:30\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure where to put XWiki Rendering on xwiki.org in the ecosystem panel....  \n17:46\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:54\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:05\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0guys, what's the status of the release?

I left it empty, let me check again  \n19:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The number of repos is not a problem  \n19:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I was on platform-web right now, and I was wondering if I should split it  \n19:06\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0http://commons.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object&force=1  \n19:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since the modules are not that bound together  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: why not have one repo per java source file then?  \n19:07\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0XWikiGlobalRights 1: XWiki.XWikiAllGroup,  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at some point you need to group things together  \n19:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually it would be a good idea to separate the wysiwyg modules from web/standalone  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me repo is about logical partitioning  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it needs to be in sycn with how we organize our code  \n19:07\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yes for the wysiwyg it could be interesting  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case all this requires discussions on the list unless it's jsut for your personal fun you're doing it  \n19:08\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0vmassol you are too rationale, as always;)  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we haven't even voted about using git  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelociter: is that bad?  \n19:08\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0\"wysiwyg modules from web/standalone\" I like. It is conceivable that someone would want a wiki with smaller .war and does not want wysiwyg.  \n19:08\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0no  \n19:09\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0that's a fact :)  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because I thought development was about being rational\u2026 :)  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0standalone wysiyg is \u00a0a plan but it's not there yet  \n19:09\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yeah the world need some rationality... sometimes :)  \n19:09\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0should I try clearing the view permission and see if thst fixes it since I'm right on the page?  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0marius still has work to do for this to become a reality  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: hold on  \n19:10\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0sure  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see any field checked on commons.xwiki.org for the view column  \n19:10\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0http://commons.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object&force=1  \n19:10\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0XWikiGlobalRights 1: XWiki.XWikiAllGroup,  \n19:11\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we have a bug?  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but global rights is going to impact other subwikis right?  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why does it work for say enterpreise.xwiki.org  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm sorry forget that  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's xobjects in that wiki  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so something is amiss  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I imported from the default XAR  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it seems there's a bug in the default xar  \n19:13\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0All I can say for sure about enterprise.x.o is that noone is explicitly granted view access.  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and possibly in our UI  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works now thanks  \n19:13\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Does an explicit grant of authority to Alice deny it to Bob?  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still we need to fix something  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n19:14\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm I don't know if that is written down anywhere.  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the code  \n19:15\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm.
