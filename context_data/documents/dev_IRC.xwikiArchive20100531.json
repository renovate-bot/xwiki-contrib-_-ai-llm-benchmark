My experience was that it works fine for loading and saving but sometimes using shorter queries fails because the mappings were not injected.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:53): Ahh, I guess you saw it seeing as you edited it.  \nkibahop left at 13:02 (Remote host closed the connection  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:05): Committing more test framework changes...  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 13:11  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 13:13  \nanna\\_ joined #xwiki at 13:22  \nvmassol1 - (13:22): CalebJamesDeLisl: hi, yes I've found it. I didn't know about it but saw it while googling :)  \nvmassol1 - (13:23): CalebJamesDeLisl: btw did you get dynamic custom mapping to work?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:23): Yes it works fine, IMO it is a very cool feature.  \nvmassol1 - (13:23): I was under the impression that ludovic told me in the past that it wasn't finished.working  \nvmassol1 - (13:23): ah ok  \nvmassol1 - (13:23): in your tutorial there are a few places where you've put warnings that it doesn't work  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:24): My experience comes from writing the loader which had to implement these things.  \nvmassol1 - (13:24): what loader?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:24): Implemented HibernateStore.loadXWikiDoc  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:25): I seem to recall 1000 times the speed on documents with >1000 objects attached.  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 13:26  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:26): Not committed because it's so hard to prove there would be no surprises.  \nvmassol1 - (13:26): sorry my memory is hazy. You reimplemented loadXWikiDoc to handle objects in a bette way is that it?  \nvmassol1 - (13:26): ok  \nvmassol1 - (13:26): ok so indeed you had to understand this  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:27): Instead of getting the document then getting each object, it gets the document then queries for objects attaches to the doc.  \nvmassol1 - (13:27): ok  \nvmassol1 - (13:27): ludovic just told me that the pb with the dynamic custom mapping is that it's way less performant than static custom mapping  \nvmassol1 - (13:28): because it forces the system to reinit the hibernate mapping  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:28): Then queries for props by object, something like \"where prop.id in [big list of object ids]\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:28): Yes that is what I saw. It injects new mappings on each document load.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:29): This is also why sometimes the queries don't work, the mapping hasn't been injected yet.  \nvmassol1 - (13:31): k  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:32): Re tests: I couldn't make the framework work without page.gotoPage() pages in a lightbox have no URL so they can't be URL reachable.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:32): + pages which only show after a post.  \nvmassol1 - (13:32): that's ok we don't need taht  \nvmassol1 - (13:33): these tests can navigate  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:33): Also getCurrentPage is a big headache because every navigation would have to update it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:34): I have put estUtils  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:34): T  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:34): \\*TestUtils back but it's not all static anymore.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:35): I'm not sure if TestUtils should have access to the driver or should just return URLs which the test then feeds to driver.get  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:36): It holds a reference to the context and so has access to the driver for now.

You can do a single query if you're looking for specific objects I guess  \nlucaa1 - (15:06): and how do I get objects with props inside?  \nlucaa1 - (15:07): because xwiki.search(\"select o from BaseObject o <etc>\") does the same, fetches without props  \nvmassol - (15:07): props are in other tables  \nvmassol - (15:07): see xwiki.hbm.xml  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:07): Unless they are custom mapped, you can't.  \nlucaa1 - (15:07): yes I know, I was just wondering if we have a function with a param or some sort of something  \nlucaa1 - (15:07): I know why I can't get them with a simple search  \narkub left at 15:08 (Quit: Leaving  \nanna\\_ left at 15:08 (Quit: anna\\_  \nvmassol - (15:11): CalebJamesDeLisl: is it not possible with a join between XWikiDocument, BaseObject and PropertyClass?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:12): Maybe. I think there will be issues with some of the property types which the tables are not known beforehand.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 15:12  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:13): EG: you don't know where a list will reside, maybe in LargeStrings, maybe in ListItems.  \nvmassol - (15:14): this is deterministic no? Depending on the data type you use you know where it's located no?  \nlucaa1 - (15:14): vmassol: I think you might need to go through com.xpn.xwiki.store.XWikiHibernateStore.loadXWikiDoc(XWikiDocument, XWikiContext) in order to get all objs et all, which I doubt it happens when you just select objects with hibernate  \nvmassol - (15:14): lucaa1: as I said it depends what you want to do  \nvmassol - (15:14): if you want to load all objects sure it's easier  \nvmassol - (15:14): but if you only want to find values for some of them  \nvmassol - (15:14): without loading them all  \nvmassol - (15:14): then you need a direct query  \nlucaa1 - (15:14): I want to load  \nlucaa1 - (15:15): if you want props is simple you can just query for prop  \nlucaa1 - (15:15): I want to make a regular hibernate request that returns instances (of XWikiDocument) in this case, but fully loaded  \nlucaa1 - (15:15): fully loaded == with all objects & props inside  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:16): Re \"this is deterministic\": It depends on a property set in the class. A solution is to look for both.  \nmflorea1 - (15:16): vmassol: is there a component in JIRA for enterprise tests?

I thought of adding a method to ViewPage to get the CreateNewPagePanel which extends BaseElement. WDYT? AFAICS there are no selenium 2 tests that involve the panels yet.  \nvmassol - (15:58): abusenius: so all coommitters + you sounds good enough for now I think  \nvmassol - (15:58): also this list should be listed in the MailingLists pagfe  \nvmassol - (15:59): s/pagfe/page/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:59): mflorea1: That sounds correct.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:59): Interesting reading: http://www.apache.org/security/committers.html  \nvmassol - (15:59): mflorea1: not sure I understand  \nabusenius - (15:59): vmassol, \u00a0how about Raffaello Pelagalli and Andreas Jonsson  \nabusenius - (15:59): ?  \nvmassol - (15:59): \"create new page panel\" would add a panel on the right?  \nvmassol - (16:00): abusenius: +1 for raffaello, he's stilla \u00a0committer afaik  \nmflorea1 - (16:00): vmassol: no, suppose the panel is there, we need a method to access it  \nabusenius - (16:01): vmassol, he is not in the list of committers  \nmflorea1 - (16:01): editPage = viewPage.getCreateNewPagePanel().createNewPage(spaceName, pageName)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:01): Maybe return a \"right panels\" object?  \nabusenius - (16:01): well, thats why I asked for candidatures?  \nabusenius - (16:01): s/?//  \nvmassol - (16:01): abusenius: Raffaello is ok IMO  \nvmassol - (16:02): re Andreas, I don't know, others should know better, I haven't followed too closely his implication wrt security in xwiki  \nabusenius - (16:02): anybody else who you wouldn't be -1 for?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:02): It seems to me that people who want access and don't appear suspicious should have it, we're not a secret society.  \nvmassol - (16:03): CalebJamesDeLisl: how do you qualify \"suspicious\"?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:03): Shows up one day, asks for access.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:04): Anyone who has interacted in the community and has done some work on the code is obviously (to me) not a spy.  \nvmassol - (16:04): it's not about spy  \nvmassol - (16:04): it's about the person understanding security and not blogging about it, etc  \nabusenius - (16:04): giving access to security mailing list to anyone who asks is not very secure :)  \nvmassol - (16:04): otherwise there's no point in having such a list IMO  \nvmassol - (16:05): but maybe you're righ  \nvmassol - (16:05): right  \nvmassol - (16:05): and maybe it's enough to:  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:05): Well the dev list gets sent far and wide over the internet. I think it should be okay to give a lecture \"what you see here, what you hear here...\"  \nvmassol - (16:06): - not provide archives for it  \nvmassol - (16:06): - you need to be registered to receive mails for that list  \nvmassol - (16:06): we'd still need to not make registration automatic probably  \nvmassol - (16:07): otherwise tools like nabble or gmane can susbscribe to it\u2026 ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:07): Yes. Another issue is if we make the address public, we're going to be hearing from the British lottery.  \nxipe - (16:08): Actually I could be interested in being part of the sec. ML, but it's your choice, if you think that's not a good thing, it's ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:08): But there needs to be a public address for this stuff. +1 xipe.  \nvmassol - (16:08): xipe: I think it's a good idea that you are subscribed to it  \nvmassol - (16:08): +1 for public address  \nvmassol - (16:08): we just ignore mails sent to it for non registered users  \nvmassol - (16:09): s/for/from/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:09): Actually we could filter mail with bad headers. I do that locally.  \nvmassol - (16:09): xipe: wdyt about the rule: anyone can get access to it, you just need to send a mail to the dev list to ask access to it?  \nvmassol - (16:10): (this means the person will need to be subscribed to the devs list first which is already a good barrier)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:10): And if you look shady we reserve the right to do a vote?  \nabusenius - (16:11): IMO since there will not be that many interested people, we can put everyone through a vote  \nvmassol - (16:12): I don't really see the point of a vote to be honest  \nvmassol - (16:12): but why not  \nvmassol - (16:12): I'm not sure how I would vote  \nabusenius - (16:12): at least there should be some people who say \"ok\" and time for others to say \"I know him, he is bad\"  \nvmassol - (16:13): abusenius: that can always happen, no need for a vote for that  \nxipe - (16:13): I think it's a good rule vmassol. The only thing is that if we do not do \"full disclosure\" (As in saying we fixed a sec bug when we fixed it, not only saying \"some bugfixes\"), it can be counter productive.  \nvmassol - (16:13): xipe: I think we agree about full disclosure after we fixed a bug  \nxipe - (16:13): ok  \nvmassol - (16:13): although I don't recall a vote for that so we should make it official  \nvmassol - (16:14): abusenius: you want to handle that?  \nvmassol - (16:14): (make a proposal for the security strategy on the devs list)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:15): re full disclosure: A gentleman replied to my disclosure of the sql issue asking if there could be a disclosure mailing list.  \nabusenius - (16:15): xipe, this list is only meant to be used for discussion about how to fix security bugs  \nvmassol - (16:15): (and then put it in writing on dev.xwiki.org)  \nvmassol - (16:15): (same as what apache tomcat does)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:16): MediaWiki has a disclosure mailing list, maybe we should think about that as well.  \nabusenius - (16:16): vmassol, I think voting in almost the same way as for software  \nvmassol - (16:16): http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html and http://tomcat.apache.org/security-5.html  \nvmassol - (16:16): abusenius: sure, it's just that I need to know the rule for accepting somewhere and I need to know that person, otherwise I'll just vote +0  \nxipe - (16:16): abusenius: yes, but if we discuss it on a not so public, but accepting members ML, it's like disclosing  \nabusenius - (16:17): xipe, not much disclosing, those people usually allready know about it  \nvmassol - (16:18): abusenius: depends\u2026 with our rule of just having to ask anyone could be there  \nxipe - (16:18): yes, but my point was that's it open to public even if not public ... anyway, we already agreed so it's ok :)  \nvmassol - (16:18): if I'm installing XE for my company, I'd subscribe to that list  \nvmassol - (16:18): just to monitor sec issues  \nabusenius - (16:19): mm, no this is not an announcment list  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:19): I was about to say that (re admins.)  \nabusenius - (16:20): it is for discussions, thats why its private  \nvmassol - (16:20): abusenius: so the rule we defined doesn't work  \nvmassol - (16:20): we need a different rule  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:20): I'd like to see an announcement list for admins since we seem to agree on disclosure of fixed bugs.  \nabusenius - (16:20): we should also have an announcement mailing list, but later imo  \nvmassol - (16:20): re ann mailing list  \nvmassol - (16:21): yes good idea, we can also put known issues on the site for now  \nvmassol - (16:21): so what is the rule abusenius for being allowed to be on that sec mailing list?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:21): If sysops ask for access to the sec discussion list we should have some place to direct them.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 16:21  \nvmassol - (16:21): I feel a vote doesn't answer that  \nvmassol - (16:22): since as a committer I need to know the rule before Ic an vote  \nvmassol - (16:22): !!  \nabusenius - (16:22): vmassol, being trusted by committers not to spread information about security vulnerabilities before they are fixed  \nxipe - (16:22): vmassol: I think the rules still works, as admins could have important opinions about how to fix sec bugs  \nvmassol - (16:22): xipe: personally I'd be to open it to everyone who ask on the dev list  \nvmassol - (16:22): but abusenius seems to think it's not ok  \nvmassol - (16:23): abusenius: that's your position right?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:23): Interesting point (xipe) maybe it would be a problem that one admin sees it, emails it to another, pretty soon the whole world knows.  \nabusenius - (16:23): yes, if we allow anyone there, whats the point of having it?  \nvmassol - (16:23): it's a filter  \nvmassol - (16:23): a first level filter  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:23): It will always be better than dev because dev is archived all over the internet.  \nabusenius - (16:24): a very weak one, anyone could easily pretend interest and produce exploits for every fresh vulnerability  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:25): Easier than reading the templates? ;)  \nxipe - (16:25): :)  \nvmassol - (16:25): abusenius: indeed  \nabusenius - (16:25): it is a list on which we should be able to safely explain in great details how to break into xwiki.org  \nabusenius - (16:25): without being hacked :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:26): How much do you trust the mail servers, dns etc.  \nvmassol - (16:26): ok then only committers + vote sounds good  \nvmassol - (16:26): re the vote we need to explain some conditions  \nxipe - (16:26): anyway if you want to write an exploit it's easy : just compare SVN with jira and you get all the patches for security related bugs  \nvmassol - (16:26): - active contributor could be one such condition  \nxipe - (16:26): that's just as easy as being known on dev@ and ask for being on the sec ML  \nvmassol - (16:26): xipe: shhhhhhhhh  \nabusenius - (16:26): CalebJamesDeLisl, well lets not be paranoid  \nvmassol - (16:26): don't say it here  \nabusenius - (16:27): xipe, true, but a committ allready fixes the bug  \nxipe - (16:27): yes, sorry vmassol  \nxipe - (16:27): abusenius: ok but commit != release  \nxipe - (16:27): so no one upgrade on each commit  \nabusenius - (16:28): yes, but still less time, and a release should happen quickly abter  \nabusenius - (16:28): \\*after  \nxipe - (16:28): I don't think it's a big diffence anyway  \nabusenius - (16:28): well, it is, might be weeks or more  \nxipe - (16:29): ok, but might be weeks to between commit and release  \nabusenius - (16:29): 2x less time ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:29): Also before we get too worried about spies infiltrating the list we have to consider the number of other insecure webapps, you don't have to outrun the tiger, just the other guy.  \nabusenius - (16:30): indeed  \nxipe - (16:30): I really think we are being too paranoid on something that doesn't worth it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:31): IMO anyone who has submitted at least one patch or reported at least one new security issue deserves to be on the list if they want.  \nxipe - (16:31): anyway between the bugfix, the release and the upgrade there will be monthes  \nabusenius - (16:31): xipe, this actually is a common practice  \nxipe - (16:31): No, it's a common practice to be paranoid if it's worth it :)  \nxipe - (16:32): I think the dev@ + vote filter is enough  \nxipe - (16:32): it's so easy to get infos on vuln before release anyway  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:33): MS is the most security paranoid company in existence, they don't publish any source, they don't ever admit security bugs and still they get broken constantly.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:34): My main concern about paranoia is that we hurt the community be separating the \"in crowd\" from the \"out crowd\".  \nabusenius - (16:35): we dont, we separate honest people from script kiddies  \nxipe - (16:35): I think that the more \"concerned\" people on the list, the better it is, as they could come up with interesting ideas too.  \njvdrean - (16:36): @all: test failures in XE2.3 are reproductible http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests-2.3/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/75/testReport/ does anyone have an idea about what is the issue ?  \nxipe - (16:36): and script kiddies just use exploits and do not tries to infiltrate to kind of \"second level\" mls imo  \nabusenius - (16:36): xipe, I agree, as long as they dont publish exploits :)  \nabusenius - (16:36): s/script kiddies/unexpirienced hackers/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:36): I always thought the term \"script kiddy\" meant someone who downloads a script with a gui and presses \"fire\".  \nxipe - (16:37): well, someone taking time infiltrating MLs etc ... will not just write expoits for free  \nabusenius - (16:37): well, taking an example from bug description doesnt need much knowlege  \nxipe - (16:37): and you will never know if someone in the committers wil not sell exploits  \nabusenius - (16:38): they have svn committ access  \nabusenius - (16:38): we cant protect from them anyway :)  \nxipe - (16:38): that's a good start for selling exploit ;)  \nabusenius - (16:38): definitely, but the filter to start is good too :)  \nxipe - (16:39): I don't know, I think we can argue for years on this :)  \nabusenius - (16:39): anyway, we didn't even have started using security list, but allready have so long discussion, lets stop it :)  \nxipe - (16:40): do we need to be transparent or not, or just translucide, or give exploits bundle with the soft at each release  \nabusenius - (16:41): so, rule: anyone who is interested can ask on dev list for access to security-list  \nabusenius - (16:41): if committers agree hell get it  \nxipe - (16:41): ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:42): Maybe even make it like a proposal: if nobody stops it then it goes through.  \nabusenius - (16:42): maybe, there is no need to distinguish between 0 and 1  \nabusenius - (16:42): like \"will help\" or not  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:43): If we were as big as PHP then we would have big worries. And when we are there will be a much larger community and we can be more selective.  \nabusenius - (16:43): ok, I'll write it to the dev list  \nabusenius - (16:44): btw, good to read: http://producingoss.com/en/publicity.html#security  \nabusenius - (16:44): (the whole book too)  \nmflorea1 - (16:50): CalebJamesDeLisl: ViewPage#administorWiki looks like a typo to me, am I right? (same with administorWikiMenuLink)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:50): looking...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:52): You're right.  \nmflorea1 - (16:52): ok, I'll fix it, I have other things to commit in ui-tests  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:53): IMO the menus should be getWikiMenu().administerWiki()  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:53): Also IMO ViewPage should extend PageWithActionMenu \u00a0but these things can be done later.  \nvmassol - (16:54): mflorea1: re the create page panel  \nvmassol - (16:54): I think you should go to that panel page for creating a new page  \nvmassol - (16:54): instead of looking for it in a view page  \nvmassol - (16:55): it also solves the issue that this panel is not avail by default as a side panel  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:55): I think he's testing that the panel works.  \nmflorea1 - (16:55): vmassol: hmm, indeed, it's easier this way  \nmflorea1 - (16:55): no, I'm testing the create new page panel  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:56): Ok.  \nmflorea1 - (16:56): CalebJamesDeLisl: re menu, I agree  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:57): Anyone else know why sendKeys is so horribly slow?  \nmflorea1 - (16:58): I guess it is firing key down, key up and key press for each character in the string. In selenium 1 there were two methods for setting the value of a text input, one was setting the value property and the other was firing keyboard events.  \nmflorea1 - (16:58): I'm not sure how sendkeys is implemented  \nvmassol - (16:59): btw there's a new version of selenium2 avail  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:00): Is it to final yet?  \nevalica1 left at 17:00 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmassol - (17:00): no  \nvmassol - (17:00): http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/selenium-2-0a3-released/?utm\\_source=feedburner&utm\\_medium=feed&utm\\_campaign=Feed:+Selenium+(The+Official+Selenium+Blog)  \nvmassol - (17:01): it's not in the central repo yet unfortunately  \nvmassol - (17:02): they're here for now: http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/repository/&usg=AFQjCNEpWV12Heua5ZRDsrFgg8hSrfUfEQ  \nvmassol - (17:02): http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developers/browse\\_thread/thread/064d1bff61642894  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:05): I love being able to manipulate cookies easily. I already added a piece to run a Runnable without cookies so you can do an action as guest.  \njvdrean - (17:09): There's a problem with the livetable for groups on 2.3 http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests-2.3/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/75/testReport/\u00a0  \njvdrean - (17:09): I tried locally and the problem seems to be in the livetable  \njvdrean - (17:09): after adding a user to a group I get an empty table  \njvdrean - (17:09): \"Results undefined - nan out of 2\"  \nsilviar1 left at 17:13 (Quit: Leaving.  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 17:15  \nkibahop left at 17:15 (Remote host closed the connection  \nEnygma`1 left at 17:18 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvdrean - (17:24): ok found the problem, inconsistencies have been introduced between the admin app and web standard  \nflorinciu2 left at 17:28 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 17:54  \nlucaa1 left at 18:01 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:11): Hmm, maybe people who have access to the secret jira issues should also be on the list.  \nfmancinelli left at 18:11 (Ping timeout: 248 seconds  \nvmassol - (18:11): obviously yes  \nvmassol - (18:11): :)  \nanna\\_ joined #xwiki at 18:12  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:13): As I just said in the mail, I think rules are too strict and we need to rely on the \"smell test\".  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:14): Rules show a bad guy what he needs to do to get access.  \nabusenius - (18:16): does somebody has an idea why a livetable (list of users in XWikiPreferences->Users) is not showing the data?  \nabusenius - (18:16): trunk version, tcpdump shows list of users sent  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:17): Since when?

I didn't know that could be done.  \nabusenius - (18:21): no, tests are on the default one  \nabusenius - (18:22): I mean the local build  \nabusenius - (18:23): hm, with a fresh hsqldb everything is fine  \nabusenius - (18:27): ah, ok I guess I know why, I have nasty users there, with \" in the name etc :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:31): +1 bad user names are needed.  \narkub left at 18:49 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \njvdrean left at 19:12 (Quit: Leaving.  \nabusenius left at 19:17 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nmflorea1 left at 19:23 (Quit: Leaving.  \narkub joined #xwiki at 19:26  \nanna\\_ left at 19:37 (Quit: anna\\_  \nflorinciu left at 19:37 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 19:39  \nvmassol left at 19:59 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne left at 20:10 (Quit: Leaving.  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 20:23  \narkub left at 20:44 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 20:46  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 21:12  \nflorinciu left at 21:41 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nanna\\_ joined #xwiki at 22:06  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 22:18  \nmflorea left at 22:33 (Quit: Leaving.  \nanna\\_ left at 23:05 (Quit: anna\\_  \nflorinciu left at 23:13 (Quit: Leaving.  \nfmancinelli left at 23:16 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nanamarias left at 23:48 (Quit: anamarias  \njvelo left at 23:58 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \n\n"}
