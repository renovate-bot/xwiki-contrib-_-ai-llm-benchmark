I'm trying to apply permissions to create pages in a space and all its children.

What happens if I rename the /xwiki/bin/view/Main/Welcome page? I wanna change the 'welcome message'?  \n09:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:19\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:35\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Evi\\_: you can just edit that page, I think  \n10:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you move the page, the include macro might be broken ATM, but you can edit the Dashboard to fix it  \n10:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but there is not need to rename the page, you can just change the page title  \n10:40\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0@ClemensR: Isn't renaming the page and chaning the page title the same?  \n10:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0no  \n10:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0renaming changes the page name, \u00a0that is a special action you select from the drop down  \n10:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0chaning the title is what you do in the normal editor  \n10:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and these are actually two different things, unlike e.g. MediaWiki  \n10:42\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0Changing the title of this special page doesn't work in the normal editor, cause it is named '$services.localization.render('xe.home.title')'. But it is not that important. I guess I leave everything as it is. I'm afraid to damage something.  \n10:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi\\_: a page has a field called \"title\" that you can change in edit mode. Renaming or moving a page is the operation that changes the location where the page is stored, i.e. changes the parent of a page (for move) or changes the name of the resource/document holding the page (rename).  \n10:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, it is a translation key ... well, you can just override that if you do not want the translation. this time it will not break anything, promised :)  \n10:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when creating a new page, it is by convention that the new page name is the same as the title you input, but the 2 (title and name) can be different.  \n10:47\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0thank you very much, ClemensR and Enygma. I understand a little bit better now. Maybe I override the translation then.  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:08\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0Sorry to disturb you again. I've installed the full calendar macro. It works. But how can I add events?  \n11:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0Evi\\_: you need to add a Calendar Application, not the Macro. The Apps use the Macro. Try Mocca Calendar or another Calendar app.  \n11:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have tried to reproduce the issue of the person on the mailing list who gets URL-encoded page titles, but cannot reproduce it the the jetty-hsql setup, so it seems to be something tomcat specific  \n11:24\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0ok, thx, evalica. I've installed full calendar macro and mocca calendar app. Now, I want to display the calendar macro on a special page, including the events of the mocca calendar. How can I do this?  \n11:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0:) not sure why you want to display them somewhere else and not use the Mocca Application for that. Anyway, I'll let you find the joy in figuring it out :P Make sure to read the documentation page on extensions.xwiki.org about the Full Calendar Macro.  \n11:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess one can use the {{moccacal /}} macro for that, that is just the content of the start page  \n11:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the start page of the moccacal application  \n11:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so the MoccaCalendar has its own macro, because using the full calender macro for that is possible, but not documented  \n11:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(huh, the moccacal macro is not documented either on the extension page, or is it? ...)  \n11:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0nah, I forgot to document it, sorry  \n11:32\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0Clemens, I don't think that it is documentet. May you explain me what I can do?  \n11:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have to look this up myself ...  \n11:34\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0ok, thx for your help.  \n11:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yup, if you go to the start page of the mocca calendar (e.g. via the \"Applications\" panel), the go to the wiki -edtior  \n11:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can see it contains a macro: \u00a0\u00a0{{moccacalendar filter=\"wiki\"/}}  \n11:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0this is what you need to add to display all events  \n11:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can also add it via WYSIWYG editor, but I prefer the wiki editor for that  \n11:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you do add it via WYSIWYG, the macro dialog for the \"Mocca Calendar\" should explain the different options  \n11:42\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0I see the {{moccacalendar filter=\"wiki\"/}}. But how can I use it on the page where I want to display the calendar?  \n11:42\u00a0<M-vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:42\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0has quit  \n11:42\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has quit  \n11:42\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0has quit  \n11:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, you just insert it by editing the page in the wiki editor. it is just an ordinary macro  \n11:52\u00a0\\*\u00a0ClemensR is afk now, need to run around for things  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or you come to Nantes on Friday and attend my XWiki 101 session: http://web2day.co/en/evenements/xwiki-101/ ;)  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Nantes France that is)  \n11:59\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:00\u00a0<confusedcylon>\u00a0Is there something special about the xwiki/bin/view/Main/ ? I have deny permissions for edit to a group and the user is still able to create pages :(  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you denied only for the home pge and not children?  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gtg  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:05\u00a0<confusedcylon>\u00a0it's page & children for sure  \n12:08\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has quit  \n12:14\u00a0\\*\u00a0ClemensR is back  \n12:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, when I try that, the user cannot add pages fro the start page  \n12:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0must go e.g to the sandbox to do that  \n12:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe check with Admin tools if there are other permissions lurking somwhere ?  \n12:29\u00a0<confusedcylon>\u00a0I'm digging and nothing I do works :(. Only way is if I deny edit in Global Rights  \n12:32\u00a0<confusedcylon>\u00a0Rights on space \"Main\" says this group is denied edit...  \n12:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, and the user has no \"special\" rights on the user level?  \n12:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have tested is with the XWikiAllGroup, maybe I should try another one  \n12:34\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:35\u00a0<confusedcylon>\u00a0i'd be glad to give you teamviewer to take a look as its driving me mad  \n12:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, I do have a teamviewer running here, but I am not sure if I can fix the problem. I could have a look, though  \n14:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0note: we fixed confudescylon's problem off chat, but this shows that some common use case for permissions is not longer directly supported  \n14:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have created XWIKI-13506 for that issue. I guess it is a small chnage to bring that use case back, but I like to hear opinions, especially what else could break  \n14:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0um, xwikibot no longer sends links ... here is the link http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13506  \n15:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:20\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:40\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<confusedcylon>\u00a0has quit  \n20:38\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:01\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0hi guys, its me again from yesterday. maybe today someone can help me with a fresh xwiki installation on ubuntu 14 lts.  \n21:02\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0the wiki page wont load after the deb packages are installed. everything seems to install fine. even the mysql db is installed.  \n21:03\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0or should i use a better fitting distro for xwiki?  \n21:12\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:23\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0nobody?  \n21:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:43\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0has quit  \n21:53\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0has quit  \n21:54\u00a0<emery[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:15\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:15\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n23:17\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n23:26\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
