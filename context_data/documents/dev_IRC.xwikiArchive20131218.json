(MailSenderPlugin return only 0/-1 status and i need to see stacktrace, which should occur in default log file, but it doesn't)  \n12:22\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0stack trace should be written to System.err - wherever that is. If you cannot find it, maybe add your own logback.xml \u00a0and configure a log file  \n12:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: what application server are you using ?  \n12:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0usually the log end up in your application server default log file  \n12:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in case of jetty+hsqldb distribution it ends up in the standard output only (no file)  \n12:25\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: jetty... standart output logs to default log file, err has separate file, but it does not have specified error  \n12:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n12:28\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0i see every unhandled exceptions, every logging using Logger, but no message with LogFactory (not even info)  \n12:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: not sure what LogFactory you are talking about, every Logger is created using a LogFactory  \n12:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0LoggerFactory actually in case of slf4j  \n12:31\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0well, Components (and everything current) use slf4j for logging, plugins (or maybe only MailSenderPlugin) uses apache logging (org.apache.commons.logging.Log/LogFactory)  \n12:36\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, i may be looking into bad file :) MailSenderPlugin is now part of platform, right?  \n12:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0always been part of platform  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it's using slf4j  \n12:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even if it's not a component  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0platform used to use commons-logging but that was a long time ago now  \n12:38\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep, i was looking into com.xpn.xwiki.platform.plugins, which is probably old  \n12:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the current version is https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-mailsender/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/plugin/mailsender/MailSenderPlugin.java  \n12:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0thanks  \n12:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n12:51\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n13:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n13:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:29\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Hello, I have one short question. I have a system with provides different RSS feeds. As this systems runs with HTTPS and the certificate is not set I cannot implement it over the rss feed macro.  \n14:30\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Is there a way that I can tell the macro that we \"trust\" the side in any way?  \n14:30\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Or does the macro did support https  \n14:48\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:29\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, i still cannot get plugin logging working... every small insignificant message is shown onto stdout, but error message from plugin isn't, any ideas?  \n15:41\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0(logback.xml is the same as in example)  \n15:43\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0any chance the plugin is actually not called (i.e. small typo somewhere?)  \n15:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0plugin is called... it has api that calls the plugin, api is separated (returns only 0/-1 if its ok/bad) and in plugin it should log the exception, but all i get is -1 and nothing in stdout  \n15:50\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:52\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0is the logger listed in the admin UI? e.g. http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=Logging#|t=logging&p=1&l=15&s=logger&d=asc&logger=MailSender  \n15:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:01\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep... so i set everything to trace and now it shows the error...  \n16:02\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0setting trace to mailsender only didn't work...  \n16:46\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:59\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:41\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n20:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:55\u00a0<maxr\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:56\u00a0<maxr\\_>\u00a0[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-tool-xar-plugin:5.2.2:xar (default-xar) on project xwiki-enterprise-ui-common: Error while creating XAR file: Adding text to an XML document must not be null -> [Help 1]  \n21:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:27\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:43\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n23:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
