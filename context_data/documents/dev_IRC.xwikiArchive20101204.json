I managed to do it easily with an HTML select + CSS in Firefox, but the select element has limited styling capabilities on other browsers. I tried with radio buttons but I can't hide the button (I want only the label to be visible). Scriptaculous doesn't provide a \"selectable\" class. Any hints?  \nmflorea - (14:25): Something like http://view.jquery.com/tags/ui/1.5b2/demos/ui.selectable.html (but with JS available in XWiki)  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 14:57  \nrrodriguez left at 15:05 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nsdumitriu left at 15:24 (Ping timeout: 255 seconds  \nEnygma` left at 15:35 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nvmassol left at 15:37 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 16:01  \nrstavro1 left at 16:02 (Excess Flood  \nrstavro joined #xwiki at 16:02  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 16:05  \nvmassol - (16:05): starting bot  \nvmassol - (16:07): hmmm  \nvmassol - (16:07): Caused by: org.jibble.pircbot.NickAlreadyInUseException: :anthony.freenode.net 433 \\* xwikibot :Nickname is already in use.  \nvmassol - (16:07): sburjan`: hi.
