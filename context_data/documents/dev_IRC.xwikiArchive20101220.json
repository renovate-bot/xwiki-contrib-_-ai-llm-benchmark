(so that I can check the translation file for that version)  \n10:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a02.6 final right now  \n10:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, let me check  \n10:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sure  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I can send an SMS to thomas. Just want to be sure about what he broke and whether we can fix it without him or not  \n10:34\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops, hadn't planned this one :)  \n10:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what would be the proper function to retrieve the download link to an attached file on page a if the picture is attached to page b, when the name of the file is specified like this: [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)?  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I changed a class field name  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from \"Lead\" to \"lead\"  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and all the object field content seems to have been lost  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex check: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/New+Rendering+Architecture?viewer=changes  \n10:42\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0There's an open issue for that  \n10:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's only on mysql  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch\u2026.. so what are my options now?  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's quite an important bug btw)  \n10:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Revert  \n10:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jstoldt: the container macro isn't localized. Its translation keys were not added to ApplicationResources.properties file in xwiki-core so l10n.xwiki.org doesn't display them. You should open a JIRA issue for this and link it to http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-5544 (you can also assign it to Anca Luca)  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so scripting a revert?  \n10:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Is tmortagne available today?  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: see above  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I pinged you about it  \n10:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ah  \n10:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0mflorea: will do. should i only do this for Container and Dashboard or should i add Spaces and Tag Cloud in the same ticket?  \n10:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0K, someone else should fix it  \n10:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The tests are a good pointer  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grr\u2026 so now I need to spend 1 hour to fix my class change\u2026.  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I need to find the last but one rev for each doc and then run the rollback action  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't seem to have any rollback api  \n10:50\u00a0<camaritei>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jstoldt: Indeed, neither spaces macro nor tab cloud macro are localized. I think you can open just one issue saying that \"Dashboard macros aren't localized\" and list all macros in the description. Anca will fix it.  \n10:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cool  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt, mflorea: I guess I need to add keys for the context macro too ;)  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll check how to do this  \n10:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yes indeed ;)  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: do we have a solution for keys to be in the macro module rather than in some external location?  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(probably not possible yet)  \n10:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0XWIKI-5817  \n10:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0dunno how to assign this  \n10:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: note that I added the keys for the initial Java macros, but now, whenever someone add a macro he needs to add the translation keys to ApplicationResources.properties file.  \n10:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I don't know. The keys have to be in ApplicationResources.properties file so that l10n.xwiki.org sees them. The problem right now is that the English translation is duplicated: once in the Java file as annotations and once in the ApplicationResources.properties file  \n10:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0what we can do if to write some code to automatically update ApplicationResources.properties file whenever a new Java macro is added  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I think it's this issue: ?  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2888  \n11:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:05\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0where can i find the documentation for functions available via velocity?  \n11:05\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0on a wiki page  \n11:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jstoldt: look for velocity tools and xwiki javadoc on google  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: it's not clear if we need the descriptions to start with an upercase or not  \n11:06\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0thx  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a bit of everything  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my take is that it should always be uppercase for all macro keys  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that correect?  \n11:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you're referring to the key value right?  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the WYSIWYG editor displayed them using CSS text-transform:capitalize so it doesn't matter, but since the keys are not only for the editor I think too that they should start with upper case  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: and no ending dot right?  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm actually the dot should probbaly be added since it can depend on the language I guess  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually depends how it's printed  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n11:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm, yes, I usually put the dot when I have a phrase, but maybe that's how it is in Romanian  \n11:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0imo the descriptors should be a complete sentence  \n11:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0technically the dot is a separator and if there is nothing to separate then the doc it useless  \n11:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0s/doc/dot  \n11:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0technically yes but not putting anything is a little like ending any sentence with... to me  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this needs a mail on the list  \n11:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0:)  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then documenting it on dev.xwiki.org  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as a best practice + on l10n  \n11:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, indeed, and checkstyle asks for a dot at the end of the javadoc description.  \n11:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: no  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not for params  \n11:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, only for the description  \n11:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0hello everyone :)  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: want to lead this?  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the mail proposal)  \n11:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah no, i'd rather not because i really am not into the whole maillist thingy... i just can't get myself to start bothering with this kind of thing ;)  \n11:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i'm the bulletin board and IM kind of person ;)  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: well mailing list == forum  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so just use nabble  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Forum  \n11:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, sure, but i'd rather not. i'll happily brainstorm with you but i don't know what should be content of such a proposal and best practice and whatnot... really ;)  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok too bad thought it was a chance you could help on this  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nothing will happen then  \n11:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0wow, you know how to make people do your bidding! ;)  \n11:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, will do it before i'll be responsible for pending doom  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:20\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but in exchange i'd like to know how to retrieve the another doc in a given space because apparently getDoc will only retrieve current  \n11:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, get document  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$xwiki.getDocument(...)  \n11:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that was blackmail unwisely spent :-D  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too late, it was spent!  \n11:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah...  \n11:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: I found a fix for the opacity issue in lightboxIE.css .. I had to write different rules for IE6/7/8.. wonderful, you're see. We might need a velocity macro (too bad there are no CSS macros) so that the opacity is set using valid CSS elsewhere.  \n11:23\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: Yishay Mor replied to my email. He attached a text file with the macro ..  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n11:23\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0should I forward it to you ?

(sort of)  \n14:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i usually try to avoid arrays of indefinite size in C++  \n14:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but use list implementations from the Microsoft Foundation Classes  \n14:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0C++ allows arrays of undefined size?!  \n14:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, sort of  \n14:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0you use pointers...  \n14:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I see.  \n14:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like you specify a stack and this stack can have about any size  \n14:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but if you want to delete it you use delete [];  \n14:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0But you can't just go on and expand an array.  \n14:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but some compilers do actually allow usage of dynamic arrays  \n14:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0once defines.  \n14:14\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0lol until you run into another malloc.  \n14:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0nope, not really, unless you use one of the above mentioned compilers  \n14:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah. i think gnu is one of the compilers that allows this  \n14:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0don't like it an awful lot...  \n14:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think it's messy ;)  \n14:15\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I suppose it can just do what ArrayList does but build thatinto the compiler.  \n14:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah. well MFC offers a CArray class and i think CArrayList, too  \n14:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0they got all this nice extra functionality if so desperately needed  \n14:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I've been playing with C. I like the simplicity of it. And the fact that the compiler is quick.  \n14:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0very true indeed  \n14:16\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: did you fixed the Create Page issue on IE6 ? Because I can't reproduce  \n14:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and i really like the usage of real pointers and instances of objects and anything  \n14:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Funny, I can do almost everything a class or interface offers with a struct. I just put callbacks in the struct.  \n14:17\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Everything has to be passed it's context but oh well.  \n14:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Biggest problem is throwing exceptions.  \n14:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, i think the major difference between class and struct in C++ is the constructor and destructor... friend explained it to me a while ago but then, i usually only use structs for storing pointers and variables and as soon as i do functions i use classes  \n14:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0And only structs are available in C  \n14:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah... well, i think C is really like giving somebody a stone and a stick and tell him to build the big chinese wall  \n14:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0he'll do it but it's really funny to see  \n14:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0#define TRY if(setjmp(exception\\_buf) == 0)  \n14:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0lol someone did it.  \n14:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0friend of mine once wrote on a program which had about 2 Din A4 pages in code  \n14:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and kept a 1 MWatts graphics chip busy for like 2 days before he started  \n14:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0got it down to about one day... freaky shit ;)  \n14:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0M as in Mega?  \n14:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, if i remember correctly  \n14:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0as in need a powerplant to supply your video cars?  \n14:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0\"2 Din A4 pages\" totally lost about that  \n14:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0might have been kW but i remember it was a professional card supplied by nVidea  \n14:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0for the research institute  \n14:28\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and the 2 pages... basically it was only a couple lines of code  \n14:29\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0less than a hundred and it still took shit long  \n14:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0heh codebreaking. kW is how much power it takes to run a 1 1/4 horsepower motor.  \n14:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0btw, the research institute i am talking about is about fusion energy... so when they do some serious testing they actually have to schedule that first thing with the power supplier ;)  \n14:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a01 and 1/4.  \n14:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, yeah, i think i mixed it up. anyway, basic idea is freaking hungry graphics chip  \n14:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0tokamak fail.  \n14:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Someone said the soviets gave the US the tokamak to make sure we never got anywhere.  \n14:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0lol, that is an interesting thought ;)  \n14:35\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Think I dislike about C the most is the horrific code style.  \n14:35\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0any dev here ?

Don't know what's the problem.  \n17:31\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but besides that, you devs made a great job in removing the bugs I've found  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:58\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: I think that scriptaculous doesn't work well when defered  \n18:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: I just tested with defer:false, same problem  \n18:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Then scriptaculous is broken  \n18:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Let me check something  \n18:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/27/loading-scripts-without-blocking/  \n18:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Look at the comparison table  \n18:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Script DOM Element ensures order only in FF and Opera  \n18:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0note that in order to eliminate all possible problems I (1) removed effect.js loaded in javascript.js (so that is isn't loaded twice) and also I changed scriptaculous.js to use getAttribute('src') instead of the 'src' property so tha the URL is exactly as for other scripts  \n18:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And this is what scriptaculous uses to insert its required libraries  \n18:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think it would be better to use the exact file you need (effects.js, controls.js...)  \n18:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you mean to add them to the scriptaculous query string?  \n18:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ah  \n18:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0to include them directly  \n18:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I can do that  \n18:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I mean jsfx.use(effects.js)  \n18:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: works if I include the scriptaculous modules directly.
