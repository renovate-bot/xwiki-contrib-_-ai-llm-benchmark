 \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm hesitating  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be interesting to have that info to know how many use snapshot instances too no?  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm leaning towards sending ping data for all instance versions  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we can always filter in the query to display data if we want)  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes filtering is easy if you send the version  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually tmortagne I'm currently only sending extension versions, do we also have some \"instance version\" to send?

As users are limited to one space only the search function breaks as it defaults to xwiki.  \n14:00\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0defaults to main even  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4 (would be nice to use a better nick btw ;)): yes you can, for example: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Search?text=rr&space=Main  \n14:06\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Hi, I logged in through the web and diddnt change :)  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0example on xwiki.org  \n14:06\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0So how can I limit the default search bar to a space?  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Search?&text=eee&f\\_space\\_exact=Main  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll need to pass the extra query string parameter for that or modify the search page  \n14:07\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0But the default search is still going through \"view/Main/Search\". Normal users wont be able to access main just a specific space  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the page to modify depends on the search you're using: lucene, solr, etc  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other solution is through rights  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just don't allow your user to view some spaces and they won't show in the results  \n14:09\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0That doesnt work, as if i Restrict them from viewing the main space a search result returns\" Error You are not allowed to view this document or perform this action.\"  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes of course you cannot restrict the space where the search is!  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:10\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0But I just want to search, for example \"space1\"  \n14:10\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Where most of my content is  \n14:10\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0But when Im on that space and do a space it defaults to main  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I said  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02 solutions  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see above  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but rights is the only solution that will really prevent users from viewing some spaces)  \n14:13\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0I guess workspaces might be better than \"normal spaces\" for that use case  \n14:13\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Even when I pass an extra parameter, the search is still defaulting through the \"main\" space. No natter what I do  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: indeed good idea  \n14:13\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Which is a space I dont want normal users to view.  \n14:14\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0you can give view rights on single pages, too, i.e. the Search pages  \n14:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Oh right  \n14:14\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0then users can see that single page, but not the rest of the space  \n14:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0That would be useful  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4: you didn't mention which search engine you're using  \n14:15\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Sorry vmassol, its the default one whichever that is. Im new to xwiki so again apologies  \n14:15\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but maybe checking out the workspaces app would be really better - that one creates separate wikis instead of spaces, and every wiki has its own search  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the default one depends which version of xwiki you're using :)  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0go to the admin , click on Search  \n14:16\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Lucene I think  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then the whole ui for the lucene search is in Main.LuceneSearch  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can edit that page and customize it  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to only search in a given space or change whatever else you wish  \n14:18\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Workspaces is something we will definately need to look into. We're currently just demo'ing xwiki and checking what we can/cant do. We're migrating over from moinmoin  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW I highly recommend you upgrade your version of xwiki and use SOLR as the default search engine  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's much better  \n14:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Ok, this was installed a few months ago and is just a test wiki for now  \n14:21\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Where is main.lucenesearch located?  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Main space, LuceneSearch document  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's probably hidden so you need to set your user to view hidden docs  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4: see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/PageEditing#HAdvancedMode  \n14:26\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Ok found hidden docs thanks  \n14:33\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0I have show hidden documents enabled, but I still cannot see lucene search on the main space  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0press ctrl+G anywhere  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and type \"LuceneSearch\"  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or go to the index page  \n14:33\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Thats a handy command  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(top level wiki menu, \"Document Index\")  \n14:41\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0Apologies for the constant questions but how can I set rights to an individual page (i.e the search page)  \n14:48\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0go to that page and use \"Edit\" -> Permissions\"  \n14:48\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0er ... its called \"Access rights\", not \"Permissions\" sorry  \n16:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: how will the old sub-wiki system called from now on ?  \n16:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0since both workspaces and subwiki are now called subwiki  \n16:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:13\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: wikis not subwiki :)  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they will be merged in 5.3  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTM there's workspaces and wiki-manager  \n16:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_4>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: so basically we will have one feature offering the two types ? wikis and sub-wikis \u00a0?  \n16:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: it seems the build is broken on ci.xwiki.org since \"XWIKI-8820: Introduce framework to stream wiki data from one representation to another\"  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no subwiki  \n16:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: by subwiki I mean the old style of XEM.
