Ignore the exception and assume everything is OK  \n10:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki.getVersion is supposed to be the version of the product, not the version of platform so it sounds a bit risky to me  \n10:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Or maybe C, tell users to manually exclude this migrator if they're in this particular case, upgrading from [3.3, 3.5] to 3.5.1 or 4.0  \n10:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: I agree  \n10:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why don't the database version help ?  \n10:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Because we had no migrator between 3.3 and 3.5, so the version will be the same for both cases  \n10:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That is, 15428  \n10:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n10:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is not way to write the migrator in a way that will make it pass if it's useless ?

I'm talking about this kind of info. It would be a good idea to integrate it somehow  \n14:47\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Jamie's solution to XWIKI-7748 uses FileCleaningTracker and we would need to verify that it does what we want (.deleteOnExit() doesn't so it's not as trivial as it might seem). I think the best answer given the age of most of this code is just to put the temp files in a \"delete-on-exit\" directory and delete it every time the system shuts down, that way if it's missed one time around, it will be gotten the next.  \n14:48\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0For a longer term solution, I would think a nice Provider<File> which outputs temporary files would be the answer, I'd still use the same backend since it's simple.  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: hmm we should do this in commons-environment when setting up the tmp dir I guess  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie when the app is stopped all tmp dir is cleaned - might be a bit dangerous maybe, not sure)  \n14:49\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0That's why I suggest having a subdirectory of things we \\*know\\* we want to be cleaned.  \n14:50\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0tmpdir/to-delete/file.txt  \n14:51\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0OTOH not wiping the temp dir every time is exchanging an obvious bug for a subtle one  \n14:51\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0(if there is code which depends on the tmpdir)  \n14:52\u00a0<blackbird\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:53\u00a0<blackbird\\_>\u00a0hello, how can I write custom templates to individually view my application-within-a-minute entries?  \n14:53\u00a0<blackbird\\_>\u00a0and: how can I include app items content into other pages?  \n15:06\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I think there's a problem in the release script  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you check the tags for xwiki-commons  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll see xwiki-commons-40 and xwiki-commons-41  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should be xwiki-commons-4.0 and 4.1 instead  \n15:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n15:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's old stuff  \n15:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think so  \n15:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it is  \n15:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a04.1 has never been released  \n15:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or 4.0  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so you are not going to find them  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed good point  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I wonder what those are  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because when you check them out  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki-commons-40 is old versinning of root pom  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they have the same structure  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0comming from svn  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we didn' thave xwiki-commons before  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when we were using svn  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ihttps://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/tree/xwiki-commons-40  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I see only xwiki-commons-pom  \n15:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it was for 3.0 release or something like that  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0strange  \n15:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when we were still moving but needed to release minor versions  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok\u2026.  \n15:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n15:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok thanks, mystery solved  \n15:28\u00a0<blackbird\\_>\u00a0how can I write custom templates to individually view my application-within-a-minute entries?  \n15:28\u00a0<blackbird\\_>\u00a0and: how can I include app items content into other pages?  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0blackbird\\_: I had seen your questions above but I don't understand them :)  \n15:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: can we setup this week the Jenkins IE8 slave ?  \n15:33\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Denis: I am not able to reproduce XE-1154 using 3.5.1 and latest 4.0 snapshot.
