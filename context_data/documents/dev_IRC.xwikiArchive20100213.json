A tab wouldn't work since it would hide the main content  \nsdumitriu - (18:37): Hmmm....  \nsdumitriu - (18:38): Would something like the Annotation menu be good?  \nsdumitriu - (18:38): http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Annotations/  \nsdumitriu - (18:38): Click on the Annotations entry in the menu  \nvmassol - (18:38): the pb with that is that it moves all the content down  \nvmassol - (18:39): so yes something like that but horizontal instead of vertical  \nsdumitriu - (18:39): It shouldn't, that's a quick fix for a techical problem  \nsdumitriu - (18:39): Horizontal is not good  \nvmassol - (18:39): btw in your solution you don't show panels on the right  \nvmassol - (18:39): they are there right?  \nvmassol - (18:39): (as in view mode)  \nsdumitriu - (18:39): Right now no  \nsdumitriu - (18:40): There are no panels  \nvmassol - (18:40): right now = ?  \nsdumitriu - (18:40): But sometime later there will be the view panels  \nvmassol - (18:40): ok so that proposal is to have the same as view mode right?  \nsdumitriu - (18:40): Yes  \nvmassol - (18:40): ok  \nvmassol - (18:41): I probably need to read again the arguments in the thread  \nvmassol - (18:41): because I still don't understand the value of displaying panels on the right in edit mode  \nvmassol - (18:41): (view panels I mean)  \nvmassol - (18:41): it's just lost spac  \nvmassol - (18:41): space  \nvmassol - (18:41): when I edit, I don't care about navigation  \nmarta - (18:41): for example  \nmarta - (18:43): when editinh in the wysiwyg, you should have the text with the same width as in view mode, and even in the same context; otherwise, it's not really wyg...  \nsdumitriu - (18:43): So the final goal is to have in place editing  \nsdumitriu - (18:44): Even for section editing  \nmarta - (18:44): yes, you could replace the section with the editor, in the context of the document  \nvmassol - (18:45): why \"should\"?  \nvmassol - (18:45): you don't give a reason  \nvmassol - (18:45): wysiwyg is about the content not about the rest of the UI  \nmarta - (18:45): imagine that you insert an image  \nmarta - (18:45): it fits nicely in the editor  \nmarta - (18:45): when you go to view, it doesn't  \nmarta - (18:45): it overflows  \nmarta - (18:45): same for tables  \nvmassol - (18:46): that's why we have a preview mode ;)  \nmarta - (18:46): that's extra effort  \nvmassol - (18:46): (ok you're going to say you want to remove it)  \nsdumitriu - (18:46): So you keep previewing until the image fits?  \nsdumitriu - (18:46): SInce you have no measure of the view width  \nvmassol - (18:46): yes but I don't agree with you  \nvmassol - (18:47): you're replacing something that is good for 99% of cases  \nvmassol - (18:47): with something that is good only for 1% of cases  \nvmassol - (18:47): I don't get it  \nvmassol - (18:47): I agree that there's 1% cases when you'd like to have the same as in view omde  \nsdumitriu - (18:47): No  \nvmassol - (18:48): but in 99% of the cases I don't care and I want more space for edit  \nsdumitriu - (18:48): I think that in 1% of the cases you want the same width as in view mode, and in 99% of the cases you want the whole UI of the view mode  \nvmassol - (18:48): more space or more edit options  \nvmassol - (18:49): ok maybe that's a difference between wysiwyg mode and wiki mode, I don't know  \nvmassol - (18:49): but that's certainly not true for wiki mode  \nsdumitriu - (18:50): So, the discussion is like this:  \nsdumitriu - (18:50): V: I want more edit space  \nsdumitriu - (18:50): S: Ther's full screen for that  \nsdumitriu - (18:50): V: No, that just shows that our UI is not good enough  \nsdumitriu - (18:50): S: Let's remove stuff  \nsdumitriu - (18:50): V: No, they're all important  \nsdumitriu - (18:50): S: Let's keep them then  \nsdumitriu - (18:50): V: No, they clutter. I want more edit space. GOTO start  \nvmassol - (18:51): I have never use the full screen mode  \nsdumitriu - (18:51): Too bad  \nsdumitriu - (18:51): You should  \nsdumitriu - (18:51): It's nice  \nvmassol - (18:51): It's compltely useless to me  \nmarta - (18:52): why is it useless?  \nvmassol - (18:52): I have a large screen  \nvmassol - (18:52): I don't need it  \nmarta - (18:52): ok...  \nmarta - (18:52): so...  \nvmassol - (18:52): so when I talk about max edit space  \nvmassol - (18:52): it's not for me  \nsdumitriu - (18:52): So, if it's large, how come you want more space?  \nvmassol - (18:52): it's for small screens  \nmarta - (18:52): i have a VERY small screen  \nvmassol - (18:52): I'm not commenting for me  \nvmassol - (18:53): I'm commenting for XE!  \nvmassol - (18:53): :)  \nmarta - (18:53): and that's the best layout for me  \nvmassol - (18:53): what I think is best for XE  \nvmassol - (18:53): it can't be best sergiu  \nvmassol - (18:53): since it's exactly the same as now  \nsdumitriu - (18:53): Marta has the smalles screen, I'm right after that  \nvmassol - (18:53): since you have panels on the right in view mode right now  \nsdumitriu - (18:53): And we prefer this layout  \nvmassol - (18:53): so it can't be better than know  \nvmassol - (18:53): in term of space  \nvmassol - (18:54): but in term of clutter it's worse  \nsdumitriu - (18:54): The view panels are smaller than the edit panels  \nmarta - (18:54): i really fail to see the clutter  \nsdumitriu - (18:54): And they need to be larger in edit mode because they have inputs, that can't wrap  \nvmassol - (18:54): ok didn't know that, by much? can't we make them smaller if that's the issue?  \nmarta - (18:54): i'm sorry, i have no idea where the clutter problem is  \nvmassol - (18:55): for the record, I really don't like our view mode either  \nmarta - (18:55): if i did' i'd try to fix it  \nvmassol - (18:55): toucan was better  \nvmassol - (18:55): (re clutter)  \nvmassol - (18:55): have a look at confluence  \nvmassol - (18:55): you'll see what I eman  \nvmassol - (18:55): mean  \nvmassol - (18:55): we're going the way of adding more and more clutter  \nvmassol - (18:55): to every release  \nsdumitriu - (18:55): You really like confluence?  \nmarta - (18:55): could you please give specific details?  \nsdumitriu - (18:56): Personally I find it one of the most horrible interfaces  \nvmassol - (18:56): clutter = the number of stuff present on the screen that you have to look at  \nvmassol - (18:56): let me count  \nvmassol - (18:56): 13 + buttons  \nmarta - (18:58): so in edit mode, if we remove 3 of them and put them in a side panel, it'll make it ok?  \nvmassol - (19:02): yes it's better I think  \nvmassol - (19:02): I'm not sure about parent  \nvmassol - (19:03): but I guess it's ok to make it in the main view if we think it's important  \nvmassol - (19:03): (important for the main edit use case that is)  \nsdumitriu - (19:03): So you really prefer to give up a whole chunk of horizontal space instead of one vertical line?

 \nsdumitriu - (19:37): That's a really small change that makes the menu fade into the content  \nvmassol - (19:37): sdumitriu: for starter I think a lighter, less flashy color for the second level edit bar would help  \nvmassol - (19:37): but it's not going to solve the full gap between a wiki style skin and a more webbish style skin  \nsdumitriu - (19:37): Indeed  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 19:43  \nnewXwikiFun left at 19:46 (  \nnewXwikiFun joined #xwiki at 19:50  \nvmassol - (19:53): sdumitriu: do you think my change for the DB connection issue is safe for 2.2 final?

:)  \nvmassol - (20:22): and only have major releases in the community  \nvmassol - (20:22): :)  \nvmassol - (20:23): to incitate users to install them  \nvmassol - (20:23): and not wait for the \"final\" version  \nmarta - (20:23): well, you need a way to mark stable versions...  \nsdumitriu - (20:23): marta: All versions should be stable  \nsdumitriu - (20:23): Git would help here  \nmarta - (20:24): they should' but they're not  \nsdumitriu - (20:24): newXwikiFun: You're a fresh user, care to vote?  \nvmassol - (20:25): yep they should all be stable  \nvmassol - (20:25): we need to continue raising the functional tests level  \nsdumitriu - (20:26): vmassol: The problem with one trunk is that there are two opposing forces:  \nsdumitriu - (20:26): - commit as soon as possible to get feedback  \nsdumitriu - (20:26): - don't commit stuff not Done Done  \nvmassol - (20:42): sdumitriu: we shouldn't commit anything not working, ie we need test for all commits  \nvmassol - (20:42): not done done is ok provided it works  \nvmassol - (20:42): if it's something experimental then usually it should go on a branch  \nvmassol - (20:43): for me the only blocker is that we still have too much old for which it's hard to write tests for + we don't commit enough functional tests for new features  \nvmassol - (20:44): for ex, we introduce a new importer ui but we don't have functional tests to prove it wortks  \nvmassol - (20:44): works  \nsdumitriu left at 21:03 (Ping timeout: 256 seconds  \nflorinciu left at 21:47 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 21:47  \nnewXwikiFun is now known as newXwikiFan ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nanamarias left at 22:21 (Quit: anamarias  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 22:28  \nxenon75 left at 22:28 (Quit: Leaving.  \nLukemon left at 22:31 (Quit: Make it idiot proof and someone will make a better idiot.  \nsdumitriu - (22:49): !news  \nvmassol - (22:50): it only lists news for the current wiki (ie dev wiki)  \nsdumitriu - (22:50): Hm, that sux  \nvmassol - (22:50): I haven't implemented the multi wiki algo... :)  \nvmassol - (22:50): that's why the issue is still open  \nvmassol - (22:51): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XAIRCBOT-1  \nvmassol - (22:51): and why I haven't released it yet  \nbbc581 joined #xwiki at 22:58  \nmflorea1 left at 23:44 (Quit: Leaving.  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 23:49  \n\n"}
