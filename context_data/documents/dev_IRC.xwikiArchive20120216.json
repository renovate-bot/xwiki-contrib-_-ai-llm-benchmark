The web server (jetty) is not properly shutdown and the next modules fail to build, because the port is already in use. Is this a configuration problem on agent-6 (and others maybe) or a bug in XWiki?  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: does it work on other agents?  \n10:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0for instance, this morning, exterprise-test-ldap tests passed but failed to close jetty http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ldap/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ldap/895/consoleText  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're shutting down the server for sure in our tests  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we need to find out why it's not closed  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or maybe a test is failing on agent6 and we have a bug in some conditions when we don't shut it down  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we don't see it on other agents because the test passes  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0then subsequent functional tests fail, like this http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-webdav-3.5/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-webdav/6/testReport/junit/org.xwiki.test.integration/XWikiTestSetup/junit\\_framework\\_TestSuite\\_4737371/  \n10:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0well, it seems like jetty is not closed on agent-1 neither, for instance, this ui-tests run on agent-1, and at the end http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/982/console I see that it fails to close jetty  \n10:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't have this problem locally  \n10:17\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0cjd: what about migration ?  \n10:18\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0it could be unoticed and corrupt an upgraded wiki, no ?  \n10:18\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0how would it cause corruption?  \n10:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:19\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0mistmatch between DB and FS  \n10:20\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0it doesn't trash the db when it can't find the files, the attachments just don't show up.  \n10:21\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but new attachment could be added  \n10:22\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0than the situation became not easy to merge, no ?  \n10:22\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0migration is something I'd like to work on over the next few months since I have a new fs attachments implementation in a branch, but migration is scary stuff and it requires attention to detail and lots of review.  \n10:23\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure, what I am wondering is that changing the way you determine where attachement are, is an issue  \n10:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: actually, there is a jetty hanging on agent-6 since yesterday. I though restarting agent-6 from Jenkins UI (by disconnecting it) will close the web server, but it didn't..  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:25\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0cjd: AFAIK, the default for the permanent directory is not the old working directory  \n10:26\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0IMO the risk of someone uploading new attachments with the system in (an obviously) broken state is relitively small. So we could either A) commit the patch and add a note in the release notes that attachment storage location has moved, or B) wait until we have a safe fs migrator, in which case I'd propose moving to the attachment store I have in the branch.  \n10:26\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0which really means that a not updated config will have many chance to break stuffs  \n10:27\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I'm not very happy about the idea of hunting for attachments on the filesystem and just moving files around, esp. without the admin's permission  \n10:27\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure  \n10:28\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I would be +1 for commiting the patch on 4.x  \n10:28\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0given the amount of discussion I think we need to at least run it by the list  \n10:28\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0there will very hot changes there which will require user attention to the release notes  \n10:29\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0and IMO, moving the storage folder is a work for the admin, not you  \n10:29\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I agree on that point  \n10:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I just do not want this in a late 3.5 which is stabilization and probably deserve less attention  \n10:30\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0./xwiki --upgrade-attachment-store ./storage  \n10:30\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0might be nice  \n10:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0?  \n10:31\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0for the future.. a command line method of upgrading storage  \n10:31\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not really something we have in a container  \n10:31\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n10:31\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but for the simple setup, why not  \n10:31\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0what do you do ? I d'like to have your patch asap  \n10:32\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I'll just run it by the list but I'm satisfied with commit and add to release notes.  \n10:33\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Admins who have FS attachments turned on are going to be more alert types anyway.  \n10:33\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0can I have your patch in the meantime ?
