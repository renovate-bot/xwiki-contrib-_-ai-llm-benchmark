 \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it would be prudent  \n10:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: all the rest of the API is so I guess it's the same  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since we had some discussion about the api  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no, the comment was about the SS  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I kind of agree  \n10:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: do you know if Velocity templates are cached on xwiki.org . By default only macros.vm is cached afaik, but if I modify menuview.vm on xwiki.org (ssh, in order to investigate a bug) my change doesn't have any effect.
