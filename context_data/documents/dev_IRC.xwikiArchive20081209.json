is there a way to build wysiwyg module only and copy some files to an existing XE ?  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:25): hi asiri  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:25): so, you only build your Wysiwyg module   \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:25): and then you go to:  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:26): target/xwiki-web-wysiwyg-1.7-SNAPSHOT  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:27): and you need to copy almost all that in your <install-dir>/webapps/xwiki/ as follows:  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:28): com.xpn.xwiki.wysiwyg.Wysiwyg and com.xpn.xwiki.wysiwyg.Wysiwyg-aux go directly to webapps/xwiki  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:28): .gwt-tmp too but I'm not really sure it has to  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:30): lucaa: cool, one more question, i'm pretty new to wysiwyg code base, what is the connection between tiny\\_mce editor and ours ? :)  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:30): then, you take the xwiki-web-wysiwyg-1.7-SNAPSHOT\\* jars in WEB-INF/lib in the target dir I told you and you replace the ones in the installation with these ones (in the installation they are at webapps/xwiki/WEB-INF/lib)  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:30): none  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:30): why?  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:31): inside /webapps/xwiki/ dir i see a directory named tiny\\_mce ..  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:31): may be it was removed lately ?  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:31): (lucaa)  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:31): wait  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:31): first you need to know there are 2 wysiwyg editors right now in xwki  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:31): xwiki  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:32): I actually didn't even ask which one are you asking about, I gave you the instructions for the second  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:32): one is \"older\", based on tiny\\_mce and works with xwiki syntax 1.0  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:33): and the other one is the new one, based on GWT and works with xwiki syntax 2.0  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:33): lucaa: so the default editor is our own one ? or the tiny\\_mce one ?  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:33): the new one has not been \"released\" yet, meaning that it's not yet the default one   \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:33): no, still the tiny\\_mce one  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:34): how you switch between them ? sorry, i tried several places but couldn't find how to ..  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:34): you change your page syntax to xwiki 2.0   \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:34): save and continue  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:34): and you get the new editor  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:35): since the new one is the one default for 2.0 syntax  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:35): lucaa: cool! so when i'm editing wysiwyg module's code, i need to edit pages in xwiki 2.0 syntax to see the new editor is it ?  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:35): yes  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:36): lucaa: Thanks :)  \nlucaa - (09/12/2008 08:39): for nothing, I hope it helps  \nasiri - (09/12/2008 08:51): lucaa: we it helped a lot. :)  \nasyd - (09/12/2008 09:30): \\\\_o<  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:30): are there any plans to implement this --> http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/SPAWN soon?

any good reason why?  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:38): i mean Twiki already has it  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:38): gwash: there needs to be someone doing it  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:38): agh  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:38): ya, i guess :P  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:39): latex we have somehow  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:39): ldap too  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:39): openid is there too  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:39): how do we have latex?  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:40): it's not committed in the main module but I've seen some latex code   \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:40): it's also very easy to add now  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:40): with the new rendering  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:40): since Doxia has a latex module for example  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:40): i just need to write LaTeX equations and have a graphical output that's all, no need for the other fancy stuff  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:41): you mean like a latex macro?  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:41): vmassol: yes  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:41): (and not like export the whole doc in latex format)  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:41): nope  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:41): just latex rendering  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:41): is that possible?  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:42): have you searched the mailing list archives?  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:42): http://xwiki.markmail.org/search/?q=latex&x=0&y=0  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:42): I see some latex there  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:42): hmm.. ok, i'll check it  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:42): do you know of a java-based library for interpreting latex syntax?  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:43): (with the new macro system it's easy to add new macros)  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:44): vmassol: no not really, there might be some java latex editors, but it probably uses system commands for rendering  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:44): what I can do easily is output document to latex format  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:45): howvever the latex macro is dfiferent  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:45): it needs some some latex parser  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:45): vmassol: ok, i'll google around abit  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:46): ok  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 09:46): have you checked some of the suggestions on the ML?  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:46): no I personally haven't worked on those  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:48): it would be great to get contribution for this  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:48): since none of us xwiki core developers have been using latex  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 09:48): that's probably why we haven't done it   \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:01): vmassol: well, but since you implemented charts and spreadsheets, i don't see why LaTeX should be an exception, specially that it's used heavily in academic environments.  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:02): i know implementing full a TeX environment (without relying on system tools) will be next to impossible, however pseudo LaTeX Math syntax is used everywhere, including a few wiki's and word processors, that should probably be your goal rather than full implementation  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:03): -a  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:04): check this out: http://scenari-platform.org/svn/dev-core/trunk/Jav\\_EXT/com/scenari/ext/latex/  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:04): from the ML  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:04): this more like what i'm talking about  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:06): gwash: I've checked it  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:06): it doesn't seem to have a community/supported/etc  \nasyd - (09/12/2008 10:06): ahh scenari-platform!  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:06): or does it?  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:07): asyd seems to know it  \nasyd - (09/12/2008 10:07): it's a french company founded by guys from inra or sth like that  \nasyd - (09/12/2008 10:08): there are at JDLL (opensoource event at lyon) every year  \nasyd - (09/12/2008 10:09): the concept is interesting  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:14): i don't know what these guys are using, but it's impressive: http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=8997  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:17): yes would be good to see what they yse  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:17): use  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:19): it seems they are images  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:22): vmassol: this sounds interesting: http://www.csparks.com/jeuler/index.jhtml  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:23): also produces images rather than rendered text  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:23): I'd prefer text since images will be a pain  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:23): we'd need to attach them to the document when it's rendered  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:23): well it's possible  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:23): they'd need to be cached  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:23): which makes it a bit complex  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:26): vmassol: isn't that essentially the same way charts work?  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:26): gwash: yes you're right I think  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:27): the images are stored on disk and not on pages  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:27): (looking at the code now)  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:28): yes confirmed  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:30): vmassol: cool, is it implementable?  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:31): sure, just need someone who can do it  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:31): shame, i don't know much about java :|  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:32): http://jeuclid.sourceforge.net/  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:35): jeuclid sounds good in term of license  \nvmassol - (09/12/2008 10:35): it's built with maven which is a + too  \ngwash - (09/12/2008 10:36): same as xwiki, eh?
