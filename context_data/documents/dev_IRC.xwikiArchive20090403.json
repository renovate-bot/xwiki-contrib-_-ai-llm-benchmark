I didn't know that was possible. Thanks again.  \nmikeyfreake - (03/04/2009 00:09): That worked. \u00a0Thanks for your help today sdumitriu  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:18): Lots of people going to sleep...  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:36): anthony\\_: Are you still at JB Hunt?  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:46): sdumitriu: Yes. Thanks for the remarks on the data model.  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:46): sdumitriu: I am finishing up an internship there.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:47): OK, I was just checking to see if you will indeed have the whole summer for GSoC  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:48): sdumitriu: Ah, yes. Planning on it. :P I will probably have some small leaves (family, short \"vacations\", etc.), but mainly weekend things.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:50): No problem  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:53): Is there any way I could find out more information about XWiki's Date datatype?   \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:53): It's a java Date object  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:53): (inside)  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:54): Ahhh, I see. Thanks a lot. I didn't know if it could do date and time or just date. Java's Date is milliseconds since Epoch time, right?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:54): Yes  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:54): Also, what is XWiki's Number datatype?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:55): In the database it gets stored as the database's native datetime format  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:55): Floating point and integers?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:55): Number has several types  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:56): I'm sorry. I have to go for now. I'll be back on in about 15-20 minutes, if you're still around.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:56): Depending which type you select, you get one of Integer, Long, Float or Double  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 00:56): Ok, that's very good.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:57): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/objects/classes/ is the best place to look at  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:57): Bye anthony\\_  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 00:57): I'll probably be around, with a small break (relocate)  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:37): sdumitriu: Were my UI mockups alright for now, or should I make them more detailed before the submission deadline tomorrow? I'm working on modifying the data model now.  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:37): I know the UIs were extremely simple  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 01:37): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 01:37): They are OK  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:38): Thank you  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:50): Does the XWiki TextArea datatype allow formatted text, or is it still just plaintext?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 01:51): It's full wiki text that can have any content the main content has  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 01:52): Hm, bad wroding, I must go to sleep soon  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 01:52): wording  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:53): lol -- thanks  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:53): I think I understand it.  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:53): What time is it for you?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 01:53): 1:53 AM  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:54): Wow. It's not even dinner time for me. :)  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:54): I'm going to update my Data Model tonight. However, it won't send a notification to the GSoC website (since I didn't change my GSoC application directly). Will this be okay?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 01:55): Yes  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:55): Thank you  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 01:56): I'm modifying it to use as many native datatypes as possible. Please let me know sometime if it will be alright.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 01:57): Sure  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 02:27): Would it be alright to use a Date property to store a duration? In Java, it should be alright (where the long just represents milliseconds in the duration), but would it be incompatible with any database functionality?  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 02:28): Would it make sense to use (date) - (epoch time) to hold the duration? January 2, 1970 00:00:00 would represent one day, for example.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 02:28): It would be valid, but I don't know if it would be good  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 02:29): Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 02:29): I don't need anything more specific than seconds. How about a Number field that represents the number of seconds in the duration?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 02:30): Yes, that would also work  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 02:30): I don't remember what date arithmetic functions does SQL provide  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 02:30): Do you know?  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 02:30): No, I don't  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 02:31): You can put both ideas in there, to be decided  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 02:31): It looks like a Java long would be able to hold 2.9E11 years. :)  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 02:32): Ok, I will do that.  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:05): sdumitriu: I have updated my data model. Unless I get some midnight inspiration, I believe I am finished modifying my application. Thanks for your help.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:06): OK Anthony  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:06): I will look at it now  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:06): Thank you.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:13): OK, looks good  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:13): Thank you.  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:15): What is the preferred way to store user preferences for individual applications? Can the Context class be used, or does it not hold data across sessions?  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:16): (feel free to go to sleep if you need to :P \u00a0I'm just curious)  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:16): No, it doesn't  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:16): Until now we've been adding fields to the XWiki.XWikiPreferences document (and xclass)  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:17): But I want to introduce a new class for storing application preferences  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:18): That would be nice, but the XWikiPreferences looks like it would work. I don't know how I didn't find that earlier.  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:18): The good thing about it is that we have a standard API to query for preferences  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:19): Is it similar to a hashtable's put(key,value) and get(key), or more complex?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:19): Just for get  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:19): Cool  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:19): How are preferences declared/set?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:19): K, going now  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:20): I really must sleep  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 03:20): Bye  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:20): lol - I understand.  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:20): Thanks  \nanthony\\_ - (03/04/2009 03:20): Bye  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 03:34): FAQ.ErrorwhileparsingvelocitypageXWikiWatchListMessageWrappedExceptionFailedtoevaluatecontentwithidXWikiWatchListMessage was modified by XWiki.joyfan - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/ErrorwhileparsingvelocitypageXWikiWatchListMessageWrappedExceptionFailedtoevaluatecontentwithidXWikiWatchListMessage  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 04:35): XWiki.icoker was modified by XWiki.icoker (Created user) - http://workspaces.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/icoker  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:33): XWiki.ModuleClass was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/ModuleClass  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:35): Modules.WebHome was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:36): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:40): XWiki.ModuleClass was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Added class property) - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/ModuleClass  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:40): XWiki.ModuleClass was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Updated class property) - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/ModuleClass  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:42): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Added object) - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:42): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:48): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:48): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:55): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:55): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:55): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:57): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 08:57): XWiki.Dewsetems was modified by XWiki.Dewsetems (Created user) - http://xeclipse.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Dewsetems  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 09:02): AdminGuide.Configuration was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 09:03): AdminGuide.Configuration was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 09:13): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 09:15): Modules.RenderingModule was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule  \nxwikibot - (03/04/2009 09:19): XWiki.SergeyMalinin was modified by XWiki.SergeyMalinin (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/SergeyMalinin  \nasyd - (03/04/2009 09:41): hello there  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 09:45): hi asyd  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 09:45): what's up?  \nasyd - (03/04/2009 09:46): few hours before the week end!  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 09:47): few hours before GSOC deadline ;)  \nasyd - (03/04/2009 09:47): hehe  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 09:47): and Google is not extending the application period, this time  \nasyd - (03/04/2009 09:47): so, got a lot of proposals?  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 09:48): nope, only one ;)  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 09:49): and I'm still working on it  \nasyd - (03/04/2009 09:49): ah?

 \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:14): If there's time, with no priority  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 13:15): or maybe it's better to develop something much more complex in AIR, with many features... XE on desktop?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:19): Yes, the right target for a rich client app is to have something between XEclipse and the normal browser experience  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:19): But again, I don't think that AIR is the right platform for that  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 13:22): what do you think is the right platform?  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:23): Custom Mozilla build  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:23): Maybe http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla\\_Prism  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 13:26): interesting, but I guess it's too complex for a GSOC project  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:27): For the moment, yes  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:27): I'd wait until Prism gets a bit less Beta  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:28): But otherwise, it shouldn't be complicated  \nsdumitriu - (03/04/2009 13:28): It's just a browser  \nflorinciu - (03/04/2009 13:29): it depends. What features whould you want in this rich client?  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 13:29): all the features from XE, but the feeling that you are in a desktop application?  \nflorinciu - (03/04/2009 13:34): you create that feeling by adding new features. Otherwize it's still a browser running a thin client.  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 13:42): or maybe by structuring the features in a new way, with a user interface that gives the feeling of a desktop application  \nalexmaru - (03/04/2009 13:44): sdumitriu: what do you think?  \nflorinciu - (03/04/2009 13:44): If you don't take advantage of the OS features then there is no need of creating an rich client.
