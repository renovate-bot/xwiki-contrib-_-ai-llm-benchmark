I have not really tried this in production, however, just in local testing, and that has been a while; but it worked  \n17:35\u00a0<EA>\u00a0awesome. thanks!  \n17:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:35\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:01\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:15\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:45\u00a0<mbloom>\u00a0has quit  \n21:35\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n23:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:13\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:13\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n23:31\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n23:59\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit\n"}
