 \n10:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I thought mongodb killed all of the competition  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no quite the opposite  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mongo is for poc but not for prod  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mongo is not scaling basically  \n10:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0...and nodejs has not reached 1.0... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but tell that to Walmart and linkedin  \n10:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0also happy friday  \n10:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and paypal  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm in a discussion group discussing mongo and couchbase  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and everyone seems to agree  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't have first hand experience so I can only say what I hear  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but these are people i trust  \n10:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en\\_GB&word1=mongodb&word2=couchdb  \n10:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0lol that's sad  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if I had to choose some nosql and someone suggested mongo I'd verify some stuff  \n10:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0the cheap answer is to sit it out... mysql still works  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr\u2026 aren't doing research?

Then they all died except SQL, my opinion is we're in that pre-SQL period again  \n11:10\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0SQL works well in a LOT of cases - AND we generally understand their limitations.  \n11:11\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:11\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0NoSQL works \\*GREAT\\* in some cases, but we are more easily blindsided by the areas they don't work so well in - and as many learned with MongoDB, there is much we don't know yet that can bite us  \n11:11\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I like Redis :D  \n11:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0+1 to all 3  \n11:13\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: so you still want to take care of http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6058 for 7.0 ? I will have to work in this area at some point (related to async display of panel, macros, etc.) so I might have to look at it anyway (but not now). But better break something in x.0 than later  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks msmeria  \n11:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: you're welcome :)  \n11:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: any idea when XWikiDocument#getRenderedContent started using displayer module ?  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: isn't this going to cause us some perf issue on the medium term: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/RamonaConoro?viewer=changes&amp;rev2=3.156  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n11:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I did it. let me check jira  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it cause watchlist performances issues but this field is actually quite limited because of XWIKI-7339  \n11:33\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I think it's this https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/aca51893724cb5203e5c7f5cbecdd62d91ec0a1c  \n11:34\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the commit log sounds like it indeed, no related issue ?  \n11:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would like to close an issue that was actually fixed by this change  \n11:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-6054  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was looking at it and saw that the document displayer was using XWikiDocument#getXDOM  \n11:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6971  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0thanks  \n11:45\u00a0<lyes1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:46\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n11:55\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: go ahead  \n11:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m clearly +1 for breaking it in 7.x as long as we fill the huge security problem  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n12:00\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:02\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:02\u00a0<lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:03\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:13\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:16\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:19\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n12:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:23\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0In the trend of SQL/noSQL I've read that a very good candidate is Postgres which starts to very well support both of the two worlds with its JSON and JSONB data types. About Mongo, besides the horror stories, I've read that's indeed losing wrt the competition.  \n12:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I like postgres, it does everything :)  \n12:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0killer analytics

Confluence XML module\" the EM tells me \"Error: This version is not compatible with your installation.\" despite of being 6.4  \n15:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0how can I figure out what is not compatible ?  \n15:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, it is in the install log ... sorry for the noise :(  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what the detail tells you on why it fail to install it ?  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR:  \n15:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is a conflict in the commons-compress 1.9 vs 1.8.1  \n15:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0one moment,. need to retry  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"(Error: This version is not compatible with your installation.\" is a new \"shorcut\" \u00a0error when version incompatibility is found in the log)  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm that's weird  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean we have 1.8.1 in XE 6.4 ?  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that would be a bug  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless some jar embedd commons-compress and misslead the core extension scanner which would not be great either  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as far as I can see XE 6.4 WAR has commons-compress-1.9, lets see what core extensions are saying  \n15:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, indeed it has commons-compress-1.9.jar \u00a0in the WEB-INF/lib  \n15:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0actually want to test something else, so I \"installed\" the jar manually ... need to undo that  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok I was about to say \"hmm we I look at core extension in EM I see commons-compress 1.9\"  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you had both 1.8.1 and 1.9 or you removed 1.9 ?  \n15:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0no, I did not remove anything, the 1.9 seems to have been tehre from the start  \n15:40\u00a0<tlx45>\u00a0@ClemensR - have you have a chance to look at that PDF issue from yesterday?  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so the scanner took one randomly, maybe I should improve that a bit to make it select the most recent one (but in practice its going to be pretty random in the classloader)  \n15:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I wonder why the \"Confluence XML module\" want something different .... not restarting after manual remove ..  \n15:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tlx45: sorry, did not update my chome yet, and cannot reproduce with the 35.0-version  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Confluence XML module expect what is in xwiki-common root pom  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so not something different  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but since you had 1.8.1 that's what the core extension scanner found  \n15:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yeah, it sais: \u00a0\"Dependency [org.apache.commons:commons-compress-1.9] is not compatible \u00a0with core extension [org.apache.commons:commons-compress-1.8.1] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" ... not sure why it finds 1.8.1  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because you have it in WEB\\_INF/lib  \n15:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there is only webapps/xwiki/WEB-INF/lib/commons-compress-1.9.jar  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you used to have both as you said  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you don't restart nothing change  \n15:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but in EM it sais I have \"Apache Commons Compress \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.8.1\" \u00a0as \"core extension\"  \n15:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, I have restarted  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have 1.9 when I look in core extension  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you really sure you removed it and not just renamed ?  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and the install work well for me)  \n15:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, seems to be a bad glitch from de- and re-installing things. \u00a0Only mention of commons-compress-1.8.1 \u00a0is from a \u00a0data/cache/extension/core/\\*.xed  \n15:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0will start over with a fresh install, just wanted to testing some conflience->XWiki \u00a0import anyway  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it keep what it found in a cache to not re-resolve it but the cache key is the file name so it should not take into account that cache  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: could you keep that cache  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would like to try to reproduce your issue  \n15:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah too late :(  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's ok I can probably reproduce by putting the jar in WEB-INF/lib anyway  \n15:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, unzipping a fresh 6.4 and trying to reproduce ...  \n15:51\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has quit  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: I cannot reproduce, no idea why it kept 1.8.1 in core extensions for you  \n15:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, must be because its Friday and system want to persuade be to stop working ;)  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0:)  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it could have been some bug in my very young core extension cache  \n15:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I might come around with another problem with the confluence import soon, but will first try to reproduce a second time ...  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: strange, in my case XWiki is always trying to convince me to work over the week end ;)  \n15:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe it is because you write the better code :D  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well right now I'm trying to make my code pass the tests...  \n15:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: strange, it is back for me  \n16:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a pity the UI does not display the file associated to teh core extension, let me give you some velocity snippet to check something  \n16:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0should I sent you the complete data/cache/extension/core/ \u00a0by mail, or is it just the file saying it should be \u00a0commons-compress-1.8.1  \n16:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, standing by for snippet  \n16:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe I have something \"special\" \u00a0in my $HOME/.m2/repository \u00a0breaking things  \n16:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mv ~/.m2/repository ~/\\_m2\\_repository.bak

\n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course jython  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like i did not cleaned it enough  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jython produce really bad jar  \n16:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0strange that it does not happen for everybody. just got a report from some folks having installed the confluence XML filter on 6.4 and complained that it does not do anything ... so they have been able to install it, seemingly  \n16:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand how I did to forget to remove this file, that's the first reason why I repackage jython jar...  \n16:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0looks like a schreodinbug  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think I cleaned the jar and deployed... the standard one  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0still it's weird that our deduplication check in XE WAR did not catched it  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha no it's not the in the same place since it's not the same version  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and jython does not relaly contain commons-compress, just its pom  \n16:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, now that I copied the \u00a0org.xwiki.platform\\_xwiki-platform-filter-stream-confluencexml-6.4.jar manually into WEB-INF/lib it lists the \"(conflience+xml)\" format in the Filter UI, but fails to looks up the org.xwiki.filter.confluence.xml.internal.input.ConfluenceInputFilterStream component ....  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: because you are missing the syntax parser I think, you can use the new jython jar I deployed  \n16:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0nut that is probably because I have botched up something ...  \n16:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, retrying ....  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/externals/org/python/jython-standalone/2.7-b3-xwiki-2/  \n16:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, thanks for the link  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should always get the right commons-compress with that  \n16:32\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Hi devs, I'm having problem to compile XWiki v6.4, it seems that I have problem on Downloading: http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons/6.4/xwiki-commons-6.4.pom  \n16:32\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Any idea?  \n16:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks, that fixed it!  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: ok  \n16:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0woshilapin: \u00a0you might need to update your settings.xml  \n16:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Something changed in settings.xml since the last versions?  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0commons is supposed to be on central so that's weird  \n16:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0https://ezcrypt.it/Z5An#c3fIsui2ISvNZzGJNJnqPkKj  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did you tied several times ?  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tried  \n16:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Here is a complete log of Maven  \n16:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes  \n16:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n16:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And Travis did also for me :-)  \n16:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: did you pushed 6.4 on central ?  \n16:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, it seems that it crashed a lot on commons but not always, indeed  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I forgot to close the repos  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I published the artifacts but forgot to promote  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing it  \n16:35\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Why sometimes it works, sometimes not?  \n16:35\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(Because it's a pain for continuous integration, using Travis-CI on my side on research projects)  \n16:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess as soon as you (it travis) have it in your local maven repo, the world can fall apart without you noticing it, but if it is gone once, desaster strikes unexpectedly  \n16:37\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, that's the part I understand  \n16:38\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0But it seems that Maven is not trying hard to get the dependencies downloaded and when it fails on one dependency, it don't try a second time and crash your build  \n16:38\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0When you have a temporary fail on a download, then...  \n16:38\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0It's OK, you can relaunch  \n16:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0But in the case of CI, it download everything each time, it increases the probability to fail  \n16:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(at least, that's what I understood but maybe I'm completely wrong :-\\ )  \n16:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be ok now for maven central  \n16:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I thought the CI caches some maven repos, too (?) anyay I somethimes notive that if the XWiki verison changes, sometimes I need to rebuild twice because the first one fails with dependency issues. But I have to admit I never tried tofigure out why this is the case  \n16:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK  \n16:45\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0vmassol: Thanks :-)  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yw  \n16:45\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Indeed, Travis doesn't complain anymore :-)  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool :)  \n16:49\u00a0<RamonaConoro>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:22\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:26\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:01\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<RamonaConoro>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:53\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:54\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<RamonaConoro>\u00a0has quit  \n20:56\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:03\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:08\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_9>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_9>\u00a0Hello everyone.
