 \nvmassol - (09:45): so forcing first/last name shows we're not some \"hippy\" \u00a0warez stuff  \nvmassol - (09:45): like we have irc users named without their real name  \nvmassol - (09:45): I don't like this  \nvmassol - (09:45): if I help people, I'd like to know who I'm talking to  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:46): I just look at the ip address :)  \nvmassol - (09:46): we're not some underground warez stuff ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:47): The problem as I see it is there is no way to be sure, Eve could enter anything while good people will try to be honest and may be put off.  \nvmassol - (09:47): sure  \nvmassol - (09:47): you can enter John Smith  \nvmassol - (09:47): what I don't understand  \nvmassol - (09:47): and what I'd love to understand  \nvmassol - (09:48): is why people create accounts on xwiki.org if they don't want to participate  \nvmassol - (09:48): maybe just to post comments  \nvmassol - (09:48): in which case we can now try to open them with captcha  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:48): Given that the usernames get signed up and untouched I'm willing to work with the assumption that there is a market for usernames somewhere.  \nvmassol - (09:48): but even if you remove the need to log in for comments  \nvmassol - (09:48): you'll see that 90% of users created don't do anything with the wiki  \nvmassol - (09:48): so that beats me  \nvmassol - (09:49): especially since there's a big disclaimer on the reg page  \nvmassol - (09:49): explaining that you shouldn't create accounts unless you want to participate in the contnet  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:50): Before I started participating here, I used to use reddit which didn't ask for any info, just a captcha, I always thought that was very cool of them.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:51): I wrote a patch to change the way votes were valued to prevent spam but that's a different story.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:51): Suppose we locked accounts for non participation.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:51): ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:51): Maybe a captcha was needed to reopen them.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:52): Gentle on users, tough on bots.  \nvmassol - (09:52): the only advantage of gettings all those users  \nheadache is now known as gvallarelli ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \ngvallarelli - (09:52): :D  \nvmassol - (09:52): is that it tests the scalability of our user \u00a0handling code  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:53): I havn't looked at it lately but I think it should be fine.  \ngvallarelli is now known as giuseppeV ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:54): I ran an instance with 200,000 documents and 500,000 links on a pentium4  \nvmassol - (09:54): it is  \nvmassol - (09:54): but it wasn't in the past  \nvmassol - (09:54): we fixed that with the livetable  \nvmassol - (09:54): (and the paging in it)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:54): I see.  \ngiuseppeV is now known as headache ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:55): Maybe a username which is inactive for x amount of time is locked, then after y amount of time it is deleted.  \nheadache - (09:55): i don't agree with deletion  \nvmassol - (09:55): sure,all this sounds good, it just depends how much work we want to do right now  \nheadache - (09:56): maybe disabled  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:56): headache: They can be undeleted.  \nheadache - (09:56): or deleted after a lot time a year or more  \nDV\\_ joined #xwiki at 09:56  \nvmassol - (09:56): btw Im' not sure the undelete works right now  \nvmassol - (09:56): (for users)  \nvmassol - (09:57): since they're removed from their groups when deleted  \nmpavel joined #xwiki at 09:57  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:57): Hmm, well a PR script could fix that.  \nvmassol - (09:57): script?  \nvmassol - (09:58): we just need to handle it in events  \nvmassol - (09:58): but the pb is that we loose information  \nmpavel left #xwiki at 09:58  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:58): Ahh yes.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:00): Anyway I think that forcing first/last name is not very effective against spammers and may turn off some cool people, it doesn't IMO make the site seem more legitimate because it isn't verified, however I'm happy to make the change if you like.  \nvmassol - (10:00): fine we can start with captcha and see how it goes if you want  \nvmassol - (10:00): could you set that up?

You can give me access to the registration page or I can upload the changed version.  \nvmassol - (10:01): ah you don't have access, let me check that  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:02): I see the registration page already shows a captcha on xwiki.org  \nvmassol - (10:02): oh it's done already  \nvmassol - (10:02): which is why I don't have any spammer to delete  \nvmassol - (10:02): (I was wondering why this morning :))  \nvmassol - (10:02): http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/register/XWiki/Register  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:02): Yes I have noticed no funny names lately.  \nvmassol - (10:03): the message is wrong btw caleb: \"Welcome to the registration form. This will allow you to edit pages, once the admin gives you appropriate rights.\"  \nvmassol - (10:03): this messgae is misleading  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:03): It is set in applicationResoureces.properties I can change it in the registration page and commit the change to the core.  \nvmassol - (10:03): ouch http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News is broken  \nvmassol - (10:04): ok would be good  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:04): What do you have in mind?  \nvmassol - (10:04): when not logged in http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News fails  \nvmassol - (10:04): same when logged in actually  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:05): \"Sign up here to get access to modify pages\"?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:07): \"Welcome to the registration form.

 \ntmortagne - (10:38): byw my last comment was \"Removed attachement and converted the content to xwiki/2.0, no issue \u00a0anymore :)\"  \nanamarias - (10:39): if i convert the code to work in 2.0 syntax  \ntmortagne - (10:39): my comment did not had anything to do with the snippert itself  \ntmortagne - (10:39): but with the snipper page  \nanamarias - (10:39): I should replace all <% with {{groovy}}  \nanamarias - (10:39): ah, now I get it about the comment  \nvmassol - (10:39): anyone has an idea why http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News is broken?  \nvmassol - (10:39): seems like the macro isn't there anymore  \ntmortagne - (10:39): anamarias: you don't have to convert to 2.0, would be nice but i's working well in 1.0  \nvmassol - (10:39): #getDocumentsModifs  \ntmortagne - (10:40): anamarias: and i prefer to keep it in 1.0 for older xwiki installs  \nnickless\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:40  \nvmassol - (10:40): I don't see where it's imported from actually  \ntmortagne - (10:40): maybe sometyhing removed from macro.cm  \ntmortagne - (10:40): macro.vm  \nvmassol - (10:41): ah ok didn't know it was in macros.vm  \ntmortagne - (10:41): me neither  \ntmortagne - (10:41): i said maybe :)  \nvmassol - (10:41): ok :)  \nvmassol - (10:41): AFAIR it was in a page  \nanamarias - (10:42): tmortagne: and how would it look like in 2.0, just that i'll know ?  \nanamarias - (10:42): smth like:  \ntmortagne - (10:42): well put it in a groovy macro and it should be all i think  \ntmortagne - (10:42): let me see  \nanamarias - (10:42): {{groovy}} if (smth) { {{/groovy}} {{html}} some html {{/html}} {{groovy}} // continue code ...  \nanamarias - (10:42): ?  \nanamarias - (10:43): there is some html code inside it  \ntmortagne - (10:43): yes html too  \ntmortagne - (10:43): i mean i don't think there is any wiki syntax in it  \nanamarias - (10:43): i'm interested how the macros are nested  \ntmortagne - (10:43): hmm maybe list syntax actually  \ntmortagne - (10:44): yes tehre is some list syntax but it's the same in 1.0 and 2.0 so it's ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:44): If you are using groovy try: {{groovy}} if (smth) {println(\"{{html}} some html {{/html}}\"); {{/groovy}}  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:44): I think that works.  \ntmortagne - (10:44): anamarias: {{groovy}}{{html}}{{/html}}{{/groovy}}  \ntmortagne - (10:44): because you produce html with groovy  \ntmortagne - (10:44): the top macro is executed first  \ntmortagne - (10:45): actually no  \ntmortagne - (10:45): it's \u00a0groovy so you haver to explicitely print the html macro  \ntmortagne - (10:46): something like  \ntmortagne - (10:46): {{groovy}}  \ntmortagne - (10:46): print \"{{html}}\"  \ntmortagne - (10:46): print \"{{/html}}\"  \ntmortagne - (10:46): {{/groovy}}  \ntmortagne - (10:47): basically from rendering POV {{groovy}}{{/groovy}} only contains groovy, then it parse the result of the groovy macro  \nlucaa - (10:47): devs do we have a plan for the 2.3M1 rel?  \nlucaa - (10:47): monday?  \nvmassol - (10:49): lucaa: we're waiting for you actually so you need to tell us when you can make it,  \nvmassol - (10:49): ?  \nlucaa - (10:50): well, now that I have my votes, I only need to move the code to the platform and enterprise  \nlucaa - (10:50): I can do it over the weekend  \nvmassol - (10:50): (it was supposed to be released on 8th March so we're currently eating our M2 time)  \ntmortagne - (10:50): speaking of release, i'm finishing ti read my morining mails and i will start to prepare the 2.2.3 release, say it if there is anything still blocker  \nvmassol - (10:51): lucaa: ok for a release on Monday then for me  \nvmassol - (10:51): tmortagne: great  \nlucaa - (10:51): vmassol: at least I hope I have all the votes I need... otherwise I'll apologize on monday for all unvoted commits  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:52): vmassol: edit access on XWiki.Registration?  \nvmassol - (10:53): you still need it?  \nvmassol - (10:53): oh for the message  \nvmassol - (10:53): doing it  \nvmassol - (10:54): CalebJamesDeLisl: hmm ot sure how it works  \nvmassol - (10:54): i see http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Registration  \nvmassol - (10:54): but it's not the page used for registration apparently  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:54): Yes it is, there is an includeForm.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:54): At some point I'd like to create a set of new sheets for applications, snippets, etc in 2.0 format so edit on code:XWiki.\\* would be cool.  \nvmassol - (10:55): in the past it was like this:  \nglerouge joined #xwiki at 10:55  \nvmassol - (10:55): if a XWiki.Registration page existed, the register action would use it otherwise default to the templates  \nvmassol - (10:55): how does it work now?

Am I correct?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:11): (to be more correct the MITM attack will require middlemanning the connection between the authenticating server and the key server)  \nbblfish - (14:11): the client does send public key in plain text, but it's not a problem  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:12): So I think MITM fails even if the server key is compromised which is awesome.  \nbblfish - (14:12): If you can find a way for a browser to connect to a server that does not have a CA signed key without showing an error message that would be great  \nanamarias - (14:12): yup, $doc is correct in the content, but I see here's a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <script language=\"JavaScript\"> and inside the script $doc no longer points to the embedding document  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:12): We create our own CA :D  \nanamarias - (14:13): what happens with the scripts ? from the content ?  \nlucaa - (14:13): anamarias: nothing  \nlucaa - (14:13): what panel is that syntax 1.0 ?  \nlucaa - (14:13): or 2.0?  \nanamarias - (14:13): well, inside the <script> tag, $doc is the panel document name, not the embedding doc's  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:13): bblfish: Yesterday I installed the CAsert certificate in firefox and it was actually easier than viewing an unsigned website.  \nlucaa - (14:13): there should be no <script language at any point, one should use jsx and then do an include  \nbblfish - (14:13): \"We Create out own CA\" then you are back to the problem of how you get that CA's public key in the browsers, and how you have solved the problem of distribution, as you now once again have a bottleneck  \nbblfish - (14:14): also your above solution is insecure  \nanamarias - (14:14): I know lucaa , just wondering what happens in this case :p  \nlucaa - (14:14): anamarias: what syntax is that?  \nanamarias - (14:14): the panel doc is 1.0  \nbblfish - (14:15): if it is going to apply to all sites, as it could allow anyone to pretend to be xwiki.com  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:15): Well the user joins a website they create their own key, that's a hassle, why not add a little more hassle and ask them to install a key.  \nbblfish - (14:15): and put links to malware in xwiki  \nbblfish - (14:16): they would have to install that key for every web site they visit  \nlucaa - (14:16): anamarias: well that's very strange since syntax 1.0 interprets groovy, then velo, then wikisyntax and in the end the resulted html is printed. So there is no awareness of <script> tags at velo rendering level  \nbblfish - (14:16): this problem will be much easier to solve CalebJamesDeLisl with DNSsec  \narkub left at 14:16 (Read error: Operation timed out  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:16): I know if we create a key and publish the private key we break all authentication.  \nbblfish - (14:16): where you will be able to place your public key securely in the dns attributes  \nlucaa - (14:17): except for the case when something very special happens for the <script> tag...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:17): anyone can pretend to be a bank etc.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:17): Perhaps we could create a key which said \"this key cannot authenticate this site\" in the address bar.  \nanamarias - (14:18): lucaa: thanks, I'll just move all the js to a jsx obj and get the doc name from the meta tag  \nanamarias - (14:18): that's how it was suppose to be anyways  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:19): bblfish: ping me when you're back.  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 14:19  \nlucaa - (14:19): anamarias: better.

ScriptService is one role  \ntmortagne - (17:00): no i don't  \njvelociter - (17:02): imagine you have a MyComponent interface, and a MyComponentImpl implementation that you also want to provide acccess to scripts.  \nvmassol - (17:02): bb in 20mn  \njvelociter - (17:02): you can have \"MyComponentImpl implements MyComponent, ScriptService\"  \njvelociter - (17:02): but then that's implementing 2 roles so that's not good  \njvelociter - (17:03): or you can have a separate \"MyComponentService implements ScriptService\" that wrap calls to MyComponent, but that's a shame since it actually implements MyComponent  \njvelociter - (17:03): see what I mean ?  \njvelociter - (17:07): (tmortagne)  \ntmortagne - (17:07): i see that you have two different components  \njvelociter - (17:07): yes ok. but both acts as a duck  \nLadySerena left at 17:08 (Quit: Time to sharpen my claws!  \njvelociter - (17:08): so I could have just one implementation  \ntmortagne - (17:08): ScriptService is supposed to be a filter to manipulate a component from script  \njvelociter - (17:08): but it's ok  \njvelociter - (17:09): it was more a rethorical question because in the end I need to treat exceptions in the script service  \njvelociter - (17:09): did not thought about that  \ntmortagne - (17:09): if you are sure anyone can access everything in MyComponent from script all i can see is a getMyComponent in your MyComponentService  \ntmortagne - (17:10): but usually that's not the goal of ScriptService  \njvelociter - (17:10): what do you mean getMyComponent ?  \njvelociter - (17:10): I will have my component as a requirement  \ntmortagne - (17:11): you get the entire MyComponent in a get of your service instead of filtering it  \njvelociter - (17:11): ah I see  \ntmortagne - (17:11): but this is dangerous IMO  \njvelociter - (17:11): yes I don't like it too much either  \njvelociter - (17:11): because in the future it might not be the case anymore  \njvelociter - (17:11): (having everything accessible)  \ntmortagne - (17:12): [release] maven release finished, will do the ow2 part on monday (ow2 is down)  \ntmortagne - (17:12): yep  \ntmortagne - (17:13): jvelociter: if the goal is to have both service and component to have the same api you can do the following  \ntmortagne - (17:13): \\* a simple interface with the api that is not a component role  \ntmortagne - (17:14): \\* extends this interface in both MyComponentService component and MyComponent role  \njvelociter - (17:14): yes good idea. other components could ask for the script service if they need access to that API  \ntmortagne - (17:14): i mean implements in MyComponentService and extends in MyComponent  \ntmortagne - (17:14): no  \ntmortagne - (17:14): that's not what i said  \njvelociter - (17:14): well  \ntmortagne - (17:15): i said: you have 3 different interfaces  \ntmortagne - (17:15): not 3 interface  \ntmortagne - (17:15): but 3 entity:  \ntmortagne - (17:16): \\* common api  \ntmortagne - (17:16): \\* role  \ntmortagne - (17:16): \\* script service  \ntmortagne - (17:16): component you not use a scriptservice that's wrong  \ntmortagne - (17:17): a interface role can extends another interface that is not a role  \njvelociter - (17:17): ah I see the trick  \njvelociter - (17:17): ok  \ntmortagne - (17:17): to force it to implements the right methods  \nmflorea left at 17:17 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvelociter - (17:17): but then  \ntmortagne - (17:17): but again at the end i think you always have difference between component and the script service  \njvelociter - (17:17): nothing implements the role  \ntmortagne - (17:18): let me say it another way:  \ntmortagne - (17:19): \\* CommonInterface  \ntmortagne - (17:19): \\* MyScriptService implements CommonInterface  \ntmortagne - (17:19): \\* MyRole extends CommonInterface  \ntmortagne - (17:19): \\* MyComponent implements MyRole  \ntmortagne - (17:19): with that you have MyComponent and MyScriptService that have the same api  \ntmortagne - (17:19): which is CommonInterface  \ntmortagne - (17:19): the component and the service  \njvelociter - (17:20): (yes the question is rethorical as I said they are already different since scripts service should not throw all exceptions as there is not way to catch them in velocity)  \ntmortagne - (17:20): not sure about this no exception thing, it depends  \njvelociter - (17:20): ok I see  \njvelociter - (17:20): yes I said not all  \njvelociter - (17:20): it depends  \njvelociter - (17:22): but you don't want to throw an exception that you know can happen and that has sense for what you asked. For example throws NotPossibleToCreateSomethignBecauseItAlreadyExists. You don't want your velocity script to fail on that, you want to display a nice message  \njvelociter - (17:23): stacktraces are useless when the real problem makes sense to users  \njvelociter - (17:23): = if you can explain it simply, probably you don't want to show a stacktrace  \ntmortagne - (17:23): yes, what i say is that iut should not be a catch(Exception)  \njvelociter - (17:23): yes of course  \njvelociter - (17:24): by exceptions I mainly meant those thrown by the component API  \ntmortagne - (17:24): and maybe we should have several kind of services  \ntmortagne - (17:24): since for groovy it would be better to have excpetions  \njvelociter - (17:24): yes that's the eternal question templating service vs. velocity  \ntmortagne - (17:24): same for python, php, ruby probably  \njvelociter - (17:24): but honestly who uses groovy to write an XWiki app ?  \njvelociter - (17:25): ;)  \njvelociter - (17:25): ok me sometimes for wiki macros  \nvmassol - (17:25): back  \ntmortagne - (17:25): now groovy can use directly component manager if it does not like script service  \njvelociter - (17:25): yes, true  \ntmortagne - (17:25): but it's less handy  \ntmortagne - (17:26): it's not even possible without the crappy static Utils.getComponent yet  \nDenis left at 17:26 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvelociter - (17:26): 1 more line  \ntmortagne - (17:26): so it's not possible  \njvelociter - (17:26): well the getComponent exists :)  \njvelociter - (17:27): so it's possible  \ntmortagne - (17:27): Utils.getComponent is not normal it's used for old xwiki-core code  \ntmortagne - (17:27): starting to use it in groovy is not teh best way to get rid of it  \njvelociter - (17:27): yes in groovy we do a deviant usage  \nsilviar left at 17:27 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvelociter - (17:27): but we don't have alternatives so it's nornal people use it  \ntmortagne - (17:28): we could easily provide alternative  \njvelociter - (17:28): couldn't we reuse the annotations ?  \ntmortagne - (17:28): WDYM ?  \njvelociter - (17:30): @Requirement  \nvmassol - (17:30): that works, you just need to register a component  \nvmassol - (17:30): so not very handy  \ntmortagne - (17:30): i still don't see the relationship with scripting  \nvmassol - (17:30): usually scriptlets are not components  \nvmassol - (17:30): I do this in the irc bot app but it's not really conveinent at all  \njvelociter - (17:30): ok  \njvelociter - (17:30): you register the component from code ?  \nvmassol - (17:30): yes  \njvelociter - (17:31): ok  \njvelociter - (17:31): yes not very light  \njvelociter - (17:31): so what's the easy alternative tmortagne ?  \nvmassol - (17:32): I think thomas was referrring to registering the CM into the context  \nvmassol - (17:32): or making it avail through scritpt service  \ntmortagne - (17:32): there is several:  \ntmortagne - (17:32): \\* inject a \"componentManager\" in ScriptContext in the script macro  \ntmortagne - (17:32): \\* $services.getComponentManager that test for programming right  \ntmortagne - (17:32): yep  \ntmortagne - (17:33): \\* ComponentClass xobject that require a component  \ntmortagne - (17:34): less easy but easy enough ;)  \ntmortagne - (17:34): (that could inject it in the ScriptContext as a binding)  \ntmortagne - (17:35): s/could/would/  \njvelociter - (17:36): ComponentClass that would be cool  \njvelociter - (17:36): what do you bind the requirement too ?  \ntmortagne - (17:36): i have some ideas to have wiki component (like we have wiki macros) but never put it on design page  \njvelociter - (17:36): it should rather be RequirementClass actually  \njvelociter - (17:37): and we could have ComponentClass that declares component  \ntmortagne - (17:37): the object just declare the requirement  \ntmortagne - (17:37): you still need to provide it  \ntmortagne - (17:37): and the way to provide a variabvle to a script is ScriptContext  \ntmortagne - (17:38): sure RequirementClass anyway whatever the name: an object  \njvelociter - (17:38): yes but what variable do you bind the requirement to ?  \njvelociter - (17:38): or you select the name in the object  \njvelociter - (17:39): ah it was s/too/to/  \njvelociter - (17:39): sorry  \ntmortagne - (17:40): let do a quick design page, i love design pages that are never closed :)  \nvmassol - (17:43): yes we talked about it I remember  \nvmassol - (17:44): ie ability to create components in wiki page using objects  \nvmassol - (17:46): good name  \nvmassol - (17:46): :)  \ntmortagne - (17:47): he you are  \njvelociter - (17:49): thanks tmortagne ;)  \njvelociter - (17:50): ComponentRoleClass: indicate which role the page is implementing  \njvelociter - (17:50): don't you mean rather : the page declares a ComponentRole ?  \njvelociter - (17:51): (and let the role implemented by components be a field int he ComponentClass)  \ntmortagne - (17:52): jvelociter: no  \ntmortagne - (17:52): i followed the annotations  \ntmortagne - (17:52): actually yes  \ntmortagne - (17:52): i did a mistake  \njvelociter - (17:53): ah ok:)  \ntmortagne - (17:53): i wanted to declare the implemnted role in ComponentRoleClass but better in ComponentClass  \njvelociter - (17:54): yes I agree  \ntmortagne - (17:54): you can't define a component in wiki  \ntmortagne - (17:54): no easy to use :)  \njvelociter - (17:54): you mean you can't technically ?  \ntmortagne - (17:55): yes  \njvelociter - (17:55): ok  \ntmortagne - (17:55): well not from java  \ntmortagne - (17:56): not even sure from scripting  \ntmortagne - (17:56): (s/not/not use/)  \ntmortagne - (17:59): added the important part  \nflorinciu left at 18:01 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 18:06  \ntmortagne - (18:07): hmm, this made me thing of an important improvement for wiki macros  \ntmortagne - (18:07): think  \nDV left at 18:08 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nDV joined #xwiki at 18:09  \nxenon75 left at 18:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 18:15  \ntmortagne - (18:19): [myxwiki] starting upgrade  \nvmassol - (18:20): cool  \ntmortagne - (18:26): hmm tomcat does not seems to want to stop  \nvmassol - (18:26): yes I had this pb too  \nvmassol - (18:26): have you stopped the contrab first?
