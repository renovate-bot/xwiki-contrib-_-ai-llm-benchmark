Right now I'm checking out it's sources from svn.   \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 17:16): flori1 / florinciu can help you more on this topic  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:16): Hi florinciu!  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 17:17): hi  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 17:17): Do you have anything in mind?  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:18): yes. Skin and template support for XOffice - seems to be an interesting idea  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 17:20): did you succed to check out the sources?  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:20): I have some experience in Java, .NET (C#), web crawling, web development and i'm interested in web applications , web minining and web-desktop integration  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 17:21): you'll need VS 2008 Pro to run the entire project  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:22): Yes. I'm using Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition   \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:23): and ofc,I'll need Microsoft Office 2007, i guess :)  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:23): i've checked out the project from svn (revision 18116)  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 17:24): ok, cool. Please build & testdrive. Let me know.  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:24): ok  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:25): will I find you later on IRC?  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 17:25): yes  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:25): thanks.   \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 17:29): lucaa: How was the presentation?  \nlucaa - (29/03/2009 17:32): sdumitriu: about GSoC? great! The students seemed to be responsive and willing to give it a try. I hope they'll remember GSoC as something to not miss!  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:53): florinciu: I have 2 questions  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 17:54): shoot  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:54): 1) About http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/ - Developer's Guide: is this the  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:54): first thing to start with?  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:54): 2) As I see from XOffice code (XWikiHTTPClient.cs -> \u00a0XWiki.Clients.XWikiHTTPClient -> GetRenderedPageContent)  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:54): it looks like you are using pure HTTP. \u00a0Is there any support for webservices? In the future XOffice will comunicate with the XWiki server in the same manner?  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:55): ok.. there are more than 2 questions :)  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:55): I'm asking those questions because I want to make a picture about what kind of data is XOffice handling (html, xml, plain text)  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 17:55): and how the data is transfered from/to xwiki server  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 17:57): yes. You should read the DevGuide first. Note that some of those things don't apply to XOffice, mostly the maven part. I'm trying to adopt a similar model in time so that the .net code&infrastructure will achieve the same level of quality as our java platform  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 18:00): 2) XWord is still in beta and it's currently using services created with Velocity+groovy. I suggest to have a look at our xml-rpc api, because that's what XWord is going to use in the future.  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 18:01): ok. thanks  \nxwikibot - (29/03/2009 18:03): XWiki.tharidufernando was modified by XWiki.tharidufernando (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/tharidufernando  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:19): anamariastoica: I just posted a comment on your application  \nanamariastoica - (29/03/2009 18:27): sdumitriu: thanks, I'm reading it right now  \nanamariastoica - (29/03/2009 18:46): sdumitriu: You mentioned there are 2 other projects matching very well my profile (Wiki Activity Gadgets and the OpenSocial integration). What would their priority be ? My fear is that you mentioned you expect between 6-10 slots this year, and you have published on the ideas page 22, which means many of them won't be implemented with GSoC.  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:48): We'll try to take the best students, even if the project is not crucial  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:48): But I'd say that OpenSocial has more uses  \nanamariastoica - (29/03/2009 18:50): how would a new application for a different project work ? just submit a new one, using the same template ?  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:51): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:51): Just change the project related parts  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:52): One of the goals of Summer of Code is to attract long term contributors, and not just to get some projects done  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:53): So even if the selection project seems a little rough and painful, it is important for us to get to know the students  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:53): Given that we only get a limited number of slots  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:54): Hey, we have good news!  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 18:54): :) hi  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:54): Hi goodnews  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 18:54): Hi  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 18:56): I want to know if its possible to contact mentors before proposal submission  \nanamariastoica - (29/03/2009 18:56): sdumitriu: thanks, i'll give it some thought and have smth new soon  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:56): anamariastoica: Thanks, looking forward to it  \nmarta\\_ - (29/03/2009 18:57): goodnews: that's the right way to do it. what do you have in mind?  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 18:58): marta\\_.. I hv a sketch of my proposal  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 18:58): goodnews: Not the mentors in private, either on [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or here  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 18:58): ya that's wht i mean :)  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 18:59): It ll be great if I can verify if I got the scope correct  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:01): This is mt first time btw  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:01): my  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:03): Go ahead goodnews  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:04): k.. Mentor for the project I'm interested in is Ludovic Dubost  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:04): hi devs! I'm interested in XOO GSoc project .. can I talk to smb about it?  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:04): How do I contact him/her :)  \nmarta\\_ - (29/03/2009 19:07): goodnews: you should ask your questions here or on the mailing list. we practice open mentorship and usually advice against talking to the mentor privately.  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:07): ok.. Thankx  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:07): Will do  \nmarta\\_ - (29/03/2009 19:07): ldubost is here now and he can help you if he is available  \nmarta\\_ - (29/03/2009 19:08): and if he is not, the rest of us will do our best to fill in  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:08): Thats great   \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:08): Thankx  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:09): cristinaS : you can talk with me about XOO  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:10): well .. tonight i will submit my proposal .. and i wanted to ask some questions before  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:10): i was thinking of using the already implemented XMLRPCClient, XWiki api for modelling spaces , pages etc, it's ok?  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:14): We didn't really do much research on the OOo extensibility technologies out there. This is what we need to decide first. Sure, a java framework is preffered, and in this case you'll be using the already existing xml-rpc client.  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:15): i saw that OOo integrates very well with java .. and that's why i wa thinking  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:16): another question is that .. what happens if a user wants to upload an attachment with a name that already exists in that space?  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:16): Usually this creates a new version  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:16): yes  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:16): It's a feature  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:17): the server is creating another version of that file?  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:18): yes. Basically, if you don't want that to happen, you need to implement that on the client side  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:18): ok  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:19): Eg: You save a document as a wiki page several times. You don't want images to be saved more then once if not modified. This is to implemented in XOO  \nldubost - (29/03/2009 19:19): hi  \nldubost - (29/03/2009 19:20): if you have some questions shoot  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:20): goodnews: ldubost is here, you can ask your questions now  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:21): ok .. and regarding the state saving (for log in) should i use cookies?  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:21): k  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:21): or there is another method  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:21): cristinaS: The xmlrpc client has a login method that returns a token  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:21): You must remember this token in your code and use it  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:22): ldubost.. I was wondering if it's possible to use rails framework for the Survey App   \nldubost - (29/03/2009 19:22): nope  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:22): xml-rpc has the login method, which returns a token. Every othe method that requires authentication, reused that token  \nldubost - (29/03/2009 19:22): XWiki and JS only  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:23): ok .. thank you very much for your answers  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:23): you don't need to handle cookies yourself. I'm doing that in XWord and it'a a pain, so that's not the way to do it.  \ngoodnews - (29/03/2009 19:24): k thanks  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:25): i will look closer at the login method ..  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:27): you don't really need to go deep into the api implementation. First you just need to know what it can do, and what you need it to do  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:28): here's the interface for the xml-rpc api: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-xmlrpc/xwiki-xmlrpc-model/src/main/java/org/xwiki/xmlrpc/XWikiXmlRpcApi.java  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:28): thanks  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:29): also have a look at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/DevGuide/API/xwiki-core-1.8-javadoc.zip/index.html  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:29): that one i've already found .. it's very useful  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:30): ok, cool  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:32): at the section: Please describe a tentative project architecture or an approach to it .. should I describe a little bit also the oo arhitecture ?  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:33): No  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:33): ok :)  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:33): What we want to see is how you want to do your work  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:34): Of course, if your ideas depend on some OO concepts, you should mention them  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:35): well .. some of them are depending, but I will write this at the detailed section  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:38): So many girls from UPB this year, can I ask how did you find out about XWiki?  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:40): i found it searching on google, this winter, but I was more interested about it when my friend Anamaria told me about  \ncristinaS - (29/03/2009 19:41): we \u00a0both liked the idea of colaborative platform  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 19:43): I think that Romania has the most girls/boys ratio in GSoC, and XWiki leads both on students and mentors  \nanamariastoica\\_ - (29/03/2009 19:43): there has been a presentation at the University this year, about GSoC. The previous years not many people knew about it :p  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 19:44): florinciu: how do you handle \"Clip Art\" images? like any other picture? (in XWord)  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:49): Clip Art, Shapes, Smart Art, Equations, etc are handled as images on the wiki side. The ideea is that they should be fully editable again once you return in Word.  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:49): This is not implemented yet. It's on the critical path for version 1.1  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:51): These embeded elements contain a lot of meta-data, but no styles afaik. What you should check is what elements contains style information. And then figure out a nice way of puting that into the wiki.  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:53): The easiest way to do that is to create some rich documents and save them as html(not filtered html). Then analyze the comments and cdata in those files.  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 19:55): I will.. but images (especially when absolute positioned) have some sort of styling (images are children of some <span> elements with styling))  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 19:57): ok, then, from a style POV, you should consider any of the elements i listed above, as simple images.  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 19:57): ok.10x  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 19:59): and talking about images.. but not related to \"Skin and Template\" project...i think i might have discovered a bug.. but i can't reproduce it: in a table (1 tr, 2 td) I have inserted several cliparts; after refreshing the wiki page (in browser) it seems that only one clipart is on that page (all the images have the same src) .. i'm trying to reproduce it again..  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 20:00): ok, please report these bugs on jira  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 20:00): ok  \ntachirei - (29/03/2009 20:00): even i can't reproduce it?  \nflorinciu - (29/03/2009 20:02): If you are sure something wrong happend, describe your scenario in detail, and we'll try to reproduce it  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:28): hai ludovic and sdimitriu  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 20:29): ldubost: We have a debate here  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 20:29): About the survey application  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:29): ludovic I had send u the new verstion of my mockup.Please check ur mail me and sdumitriu hav lots of confution points  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:31): 12:12:59 AM) sdumitriu: Just tell me how will a flash video be used in the survey  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:31): (12:13:16 AM) ChathuraPrabuddh: I have a plan In my mind thats why I asked u abt that...  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:31): (12:13:18 AM) sdumitriu: I just wanted a quick answer  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:31): (12:13:30 AM) ChathuraPrabuddh: ok wait  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:31): (12:14:40 AM) ChathuraPrabuddh: Oh sorry I got it wrong..

I think  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 20:50): Yes  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:50): by simple mode normal people can achieve their goal  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:51): I'm also thinking abt marketing perspective as well  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:51): don't kno I'm correct..  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 20:52): Yes  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 20:52): It's my dutiy to address all the scope for the benifit of Xwiki  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 21:11): :'(  \nsdumitriu - (29/03/2009 21:12): ChathuraPrabuddh: Don't worry, it usually takes some time to reach a consensus in distributed development  \nChathuraPrabuddh - (29/03/2009 21:14): \u00a0Sorry.
