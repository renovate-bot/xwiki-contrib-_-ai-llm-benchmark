I haven't found the cause yet, need ti check with Thomas, but take a look here http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-4.3/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/167/testReport/org.xwiki.test.ui.annotations/AnnotationsTest/AddAndDeleteAnnotations/  \n14:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for ui-tests the log is fine  \n14:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0on CI  \n14:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0anyway, the screenshot is taken even for extension tests, you just have to know where to look for it for now, until I find why log level is warn  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I know it's taken  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we just need to fix the logging  \n14:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could use SOP otherwise  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of LOGGEr  \n14:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0SOP?  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that we separate application logging from test logging  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0system.out.println  \n14:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ah, I though that's bad :)  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes in production code  \n14:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n14:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll try to fix the logging level first though  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we need better rules for the logging configuration, I just hope it won't make it too complex  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes introduce dependency in code  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/yes/ie  \n14:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's working fine for ui-tests, so there must be something different in extension-test but I haven't found what  \n14:44\u00a0<autoditac>\u00a0vmassol, i'll send you a very stripped down version of the wiki (one DokuWiki page in a zip file), if that is ok for you?  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0autoditac: ok  \n14:46\u00a0<autoditac>\u00a0vmassol, did you get the send request?  \n14:58\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Since when, does xwiki support component?  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0crocket: see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Component+Module (compatibility field) + http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-1662#  \n15:04\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0ok  \n15:06\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0What about ScriptService?  \n15:11\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-5111 ?  \n15:12\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I guess ScriptService is available since 3.0 RC1  \n15:12\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0s/is/has been/  \n15:14\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0probably before that  \n15:14\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a02.x  \n15:15\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0jvelo, Can you refer me to the evidence?  \n15:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0you can see XWIKI-5111 affects 2.3 so it is likely it has been created in this timeframe, meaning script service existed by then  \n15:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0for the exact release, you have to dig JIRA or the release notes, or git history  \n15:17\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0jvelo : phew  \n15:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelo: hint: look at ScriptService.java  \n15:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0vmassol: you meant crocket  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"for the exact release, you have to dig JIRA or the release notes, or git history\"  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was answering to that :)  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm not answering crocket, he asks too many questions :))  \n15:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I'm not the one searching for it :)  \n15:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok you seems to not know so I was helping you  \n15:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but yes, ScriptService.java is the file to dig  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0crocket could have found easily by searching  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I alrady explained to him how to get the version for the components  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so he could have extrapolated and done the same for script service  \n15:26\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I don't recall it now.  \n15:27\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0hint: press \"t\" on github.com xwiki platform project  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or jsut use what I already explained, ie. search on e.x.o  \n15:29\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Oh, I was so stupid.  \n15:30\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Maybe I should fire myself.  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<private joke for French people>Allllooo?
