Should users be able to register skins without PR? \u00a02. Should skins be able to define macros which override global macros?  \nsdumitriu - (17:49): 1: Yes  \nsdumitriu - (17:49): 2: Yes, but only locally  \nsdumitriu - (17:49): As in, as long as that skin is used  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:50): So it's correct behavior that I can join a wiki, upload a skin, view PR pages with that skin...  \nsdumitriu - (17:50): For \"no\", there's a simple velocity property which needs to be set, which prevents a template from redefining a global macro  \nsdumitriu - (17:50): No, that's not correct  \nsdumitriu - (17:50): A skin should NEVER have PR  \nsdumitriu - (17:51): PR should only apply to content inside documents  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:51): It doesn't have to if the PR document calls macros which I defined.  \nsdumitriu - (17:51): This is the behavior that's bad right now  \nsdumitriu - (17:51): Hm, right  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:51): That's why I was asking if it's correct/policy.  \nsdumitriu - (17:51): Well, documents should not call macros  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:52): ?? \u00a0(then what are they there for?)  \nsdumitriu - (17:52): For skins  \nsdumitriu - (17:52): That is, velocity macros  \nsdumitriu - (17:53): 2.0 macros cannot be defined in skins, so that's not a problem  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:53): Well if this is incorrect behavior I think we need a bug, if it's correct we need a big warning on the scripting page.  \nsdumitriu - (17:53): 1.0 macros should disappear  \nsdumitriu - (17:54): That's just my view  \nsdumitriu - (17:54): WDYT?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:54): 1.0 meaning velocity? \u00a0I don't know. I think they could be fixed if handled better.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:55): I'm not a big fan of the giant templates folder.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:55): It's nice to be able to break up a script by putting it in velocity macros though.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:01): I'll put it to the list. It's too easy for a user to say #lightbox and not know that it might be a security issue.  \nflorinciu left at 19:10 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 19:11  \nsdumitriu left at 20:34 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 21:08  \nmflorea left at 21:48 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu left at 22:19 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nCiprian joined #xwiki at 22:39  \nCiprian left #xwiki at 22:59  \n\n"}
