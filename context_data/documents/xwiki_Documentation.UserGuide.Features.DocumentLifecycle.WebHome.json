The resulting link will show up with a question mark next to it, showing it as a non-existent page. Simply click on the link to create the page as a child of the current page.\n\n![CreateInWYSIWYG.PNG](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/CreateInWYSIWYG.PNG?rev=1.5)\n\nThis will take you directly to the edit mode for the missing page. **This is the recommended approach** as it'll allow you to create a hierarchy while you create new pages.\n\nUsers and applications can provide pages that can be used as [templates](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application#HTemplates) when creating new pages. The new page content (content, objects, and other meta data) will be replicated from the template. When clicking on a \"wanted link\", if there are available templates, you will be asked to select one:\n\n![templateSelectorForWantedLink.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/templateSelectorForWantedLink.png?rev=1.1)\n\nThen you will be taken to the Inline Form edit mode corresponding to the selected page template.\n\n## By using the Add Page action\n\nYou can create a new child page for the current page by using the plus icon located to the right of the page title.\n\n![AddPage.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/AddPage.png?rev=1.7)\n\nThis will open the Create Page wizard where you can specify the title of the new page.\n\nBy default, the new page will be created as a child of the current page. If you don't want that, then you can change the location of the target page using the page picker (by selecting an existing parent).\n\nNote: When creating a new page from the wiki's homepage (i.e., clicking the plus icon from the wiki's homepage), there is an exception to the above behavior. In this case, the default is to create a top level page instead of a child of the current page (homepage). If your intention was really to create a child of the homepage (which is not usually the case for homepages), then you can use the page picker and select the homepage as parent of the new page.\n\nYou can also select a [template](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application#HTemplatesCreationandAdministration) for the new page.\n\nOnce you're done click the \"Create\" button and you will be able to edit your newly created page right away.\n\nThis is what you'll see if you're a [simple user](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing#HSimpleandAdvancededitingmodes):  \n![CreatePageSimple.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/CreatePageSimple.png?rev=1.1)\n\nAnd if you're an [advanced user](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing#HSimpleandAdvancededitingmodes) you'll be able to control whether the page created will be a Terminal page (i.e., a page that cannot have children, see also [Terminology](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/#HTerminology)) or not:\n\n![CreatePageAdvanced.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/CreatePageAdvanced.png?rev=1.1)\n\n## By entering directly the URL of the new page\n\nYou can also **enter the new page name (and its path) directly in the URL of your browser**. For example http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Movies/Thriller/Rear Window. If the target page doesn't exist then you'll get an empty page with a message saying that the page doesn't exist and there'll be a link to create it:\n\n![CreateInURL.PNG](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/CreateInURL.PNG?rev=1.7)\n\n## Limitations\n\nStarting with XWiki 11.4RC1 you might see a warning such as the following when creating a document:\u00a0\n\n![page-fullname-toolong.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/page-fullname-toolong.png?rev=1.2)\n\nThis means that the complete path of the document (the name of the document and the names of its ancestors) is too long, and you have either to rename the document, or to try creating it at antoher place.\n\n# Edit\n\nThis allows the editing of a page. See the [page editing](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing) tutorial for more details.\n\n# Delete\n\nRemoves a page and puts it in the trash.\n\n![DeletePageFlamingo.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/DeletePageFlamingo.png?rev=1.3)\n\nA confirmation is asked before the removal is done. Here, you can decide either or not to delete the children along with the current page.\n\n![DeleteConfirmFlamingo.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/DeleteConfirmFlamingo.png?rev=1.7)  \n![DeleteConfirmFlamingoExpanded.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/DeleteConfirmFlamingoExpanded.png?rev=1.1)\n\nIf there are internal references to the deleted page, these can be updated to point to a new page by selecting a target using the page picker.\n\nTo fix eventual broken external links (e.g., bookmarks) to the deleted page you can choose to create an automatic redirect from the old location to the new selected target. Note: if a link was made to another wiki page as an external link (by copy-pasting the address bar in the browser) instead of using the wiki syntax to point to the page reference or the Wysiwyg Link menu, this reference is considered an external one and thus not updated automatically.\n\n[![deletePageBacklinksPane.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/deletePageBacklinksPane.png?width=960&rev=1.2)](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/deletePageBacklinksPane.png?rev=1.2)\n\nAdvanced user can be allowed to choose whether they want to delete the page permanently, or send it to the recycle bin.\n\nIn this case, the following options are presented on the page delete screen.\n\n![skip_recycle_bin_screen.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/skip_recycle_bin_screen_cropped.png?rev=1.2)\n\nNote: When deleting a non-terminal page and the only child of that page is the 'WebPreferences' terminal page, the 'Affect children' checkbox will be checked by default. Normally, it would be unchecked, but in this case we've noticed that it's very easy to forget about that page (since it's hidden and automatically created when going into 'Page Administration') and your deleted page might still show up in some places because of that leftover. You can still uncheck it if you know what you are doing.\n\nThen, you have to wait during the deletion of the page:\n\n![Deleting.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/Deleting.png?rev=1.1)\n\nAnd finally, you have the success message:\n\n![DeleteFlamingoConfirm.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/DeleteFlamingoConfirm.png?rev=1.2)\n\nNote that if someone else is currently performing an action on the page you want to delete, you might see the following information box:\n\n![job-waiting-infobox.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/job-waiting-infobox.png?rev=1.2)\n\nThe deletion will automatically resume when the other job is finished or cancelled. You shouldn't quit the page, since some questions can be asked during the deletion.\n\n## Pages that belong to extensions\n\nBefore the success message, you might see the following screen:\n\n![DeleteExtensionPage.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/DeleteExtensionPage.png?rev=1.1)\n\nIt happens when you try to delete a page that belong to an extension. This page could be one of the children of the current page. If you continue the delete action, the extension will not work anymore.\n\nMoreover, it is not recommended to delete pages that belong to extensions manually. You should use the [Extension Manager](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Extension%20Manager%20Application) instead.\n\nThis screen makes you able to select precisely which pages to remove and which ones to preserve. You can also abort the action by clicking on the \"Cancel\" button.\n\n## Pages that contains a used XClass\n\nStarting with 10.10RC1, you might also see one of the following screen:\n\n![delete_simpleuser_xclass.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/delete_simpleuser_xclass.png?rev=1.1)  \n![delete_advanceduser_xclass.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/delete_advanceduser_xclass.png?rev=1.1)\n\nIt happens when you try to delete a page that contains an XClass which is used somewhere. This page could be one of the children of the current page. If you continue the delete action, some other pages will not work anymore. That is why the action is completely forbidden for simple users. Advanced users are allowed to choose precisely the pages to remove and those to preserve. They can also abort the action by clicking on the \"Cancel\" button.\n\n# Restore\n\nTo restore a deleted page or remove it from the trash (you'll need to have Admin permissions), check the documentation for the [Index Application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Index%20Application).\n\n# Copy\n\nIf you want to create a copy of an existing page then you have to navigate to that page (access that page in view mode) and then select the Copy entry from the page menu (that is located to the right of the page title).\n\n![CopyPageFlamingo.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/CopyPageFlamingo.png?rev=1.3)\n\nThis will take you to the Copy Page Wizard where you can specify the title of the copy and its new location.\n\n![CopyPageConfirmFlamingo.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/CopyPageConfirmFlamingo.png?rev=1.5)\n\nIf the page is translated in multiple languages then you can select which translation to copy, or you can copy all the translations. If the page has child pages then you can choose to copy them as well (this way you can replicate a hierarchy of pages).\n\n![copyStatus.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/copyStatus.png?rev=1.4)\n\nOnce you click the Copy button you are taken to the Copy Status page where you can see the options that you have selected and the progress of the copy operation. The copy is performed asynchronously. The progress bar is replaced with the operation status at the end in order to let you know if the operation succeeded or failed. You can use the breadcrumbs to navigate to the new page or the old one.\n\nStarting with 11.1RC1, you might see the following box information instead of the progress bar if another job is currently performed against the pages you selected:\n\n![job-waiting-infobox.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/job-waiting-infobox.png?rev=1.2)\n\n# Move/Rename\n\nIf you want to rename or move an existing page then you have to navigate to that page (access that page in view mode) and then select the Rename entry from the page menu (that is located to the right of the page title).\n\n![RenameFlamingo.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/RenameFlamingo.png?rev=1.4)\n\nThis will take you to the Rename Page Wizard where you can specify the new page title (if you want to rename) and/or the new page location (if you want to move the page to a different location).\n\nThis is what you'll see if you're a [simple user](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing#HSimpleandAdvancededitingmodes) (**Note**: you can only see the options to Move / Rename or Delete if you have the Delete Rights or if you are making the changes on a page you've created):  \n![RenameConfirmFlamingoSimple.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/RenameConfirmFlamingoSimple.png?rev=1.3)\n\nAnd if you're an [advanced user](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing#HSimpleandAdvancededitingmodes) you'll be able to also control:\n\n* whether to update the back-links to the renamed page\n* whether the new page will be a Terminal page (i.e., a page that cannot have children, see also [Terminology](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/#HTerminology)) or not\n\n![RenameConfirmFlamingoAdvanced.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/RenameConfirmFlamingoAdvanced.png?rev=1.2)\n\nIf the page has child pages then you can choose to move them to the new location as well. This way the hierarchy under the renamed page is going to be preserved. Otherwise, if you choose to preserve the current path of the child pages (keep the children in place) then they will become \"orphans\": they will still be accessible with the same URLs (bookmarks are not broken) but they will have a missing parent (which you can fix by creating the parent page later).\n\nBy default (unless advanced users uncheck the box), all internal references in the wiki to the renamed page (and child pages) will be updated to point to the new location of the page (this includes links in content, values of wiki macro parameters, etc.), except for the [limitations detailed below](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/#HLimitations-1). The pages or objects containing these references will be updated to point to the new reference and these modifications will be visible in the history of the impacted page with a comment of type \"Renamed back-links.\".\n\nIn case there are external links (e.g., bookmarks) to the renamed page (or its child pages) they will be broken after the rename unless you choose to create an automatic redirect from the old location to the new one. Note: if a link was made to another wiki page as an external link (by copy-pasting the address bar in the browser) instead of using the wiki syntax to point to the page reference or the Wysiwyg Link menu, this reference is considered an external one and thus not updated automatically.\n\nOnce you click the Rename button you are taken to the Rename Status page where you can see the options that you have selected and the progress of the rename operation. The rename, like the copy, is performed asynchronously. The progress bar is replaced with the operation status at the end in order to let you know if the operation succeeded or failed. You can use the breadcrumbs to navigate to the new page or the old one.\n\n![renameProgress.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/renameProgress.png?rev=1.4)\n\nStarting with 11.1RC1, you might see the following box information instead of the progress bar if another job is currently performed against the pages you selected:\n\n![job-waiting-infobox.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/job-waiting-infobox.png?rev=1.2)\n\n## Pages that belong to extensions\n\nBefore the success message, you might see the following screen:\n\n![renameextension.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/renameextension.png?rev=1.1)\n\nIt happens when you try to rename a page that belong to an extension. This page could be one of the children of the current page. If you continue the rename action, the extension might not work anymore.\n\nThis screen makes you able to select precisely which pages to rename and which ones to preserve. You can also abort the action by clicking on the \"Cancel\" button.\n\n## Pages that contains a used XClass\n\nStarting with 10.10RC1, you might also see one of the following screen:\n\n![rename_simpleuser_xclass.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/rename_simpleuser_xclass.png?rev=1.1)  \n![rename_advanceduser_xclass.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/rename_advanceduser_xclass.png?rev=1.1)\n\nIt happens when you try to rename or move a page that contains an XClass which is used somewhere. This page could be one of the children of the current page. If you continue the renaming/moving action, some other pages will not work anymore. That is why the action is completely forbidden for simple users. Advanced users are allowed to chose precisely the pages to move and those to preserve. They can also abort the action by clicking on the \"Cancel\" button.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThere are still some limitations on renaming a page, related to the update of the references pointing to that page to point to the new location of the page:\n\n* Backlinks have to be turned on (they are turned on by default but if you have turned them off, rename will not rename backlinks and you'll have to turn them on again to benefit from this feature)\n* [Image references are broken when contained in a renamed terminal page](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18634)\n* Backlinks are saved when a page is saved thus it may happen with a clean XWiki database that backlinks are not saved. In this special case, you can call the following in a page to refresh all links (you'll need to be admin to do this):$xwiki.refreshLinks()\n* Only links located inside macro content and for macros whose content is of type wiki syntax, are renamed\n\n\n\t+ This means for example that links inside scripting macros are not renamed: velocity, groovy, html (with wiki syntax activated), etc.\n\t+ It also means that macros which accept wiki syntax as content but do not declare it as such (because they were built based on an older version of the API) also don't see their links renamed\n* None of the backlinks located inside macro content are renamed \u2014 even those in wiki syntax macros.\n* The references used in the document and reference macro parameters of the include and display macros are renamed. The [page parameter is currently not renamed](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19539)\n* [Backlinks located in XObjects and translated content are not renamed](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-981).\n* XWiki <14.8\u00a0Links pointing to the renamed/moved page and located in other wikis [are not currently refactored](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-16192).\n\n\n\n---\n\nAdditional page information and operations are available from the wiki page menu, described below.\n\n# Show\n\nWhenever you click on a link to a page XWiki automatically shows the page in view mode. This is the default mode. XWiki also supports displaying the page in other formats that may be more adapted to specific circumstances:\n\n* [Code](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/#HCode)\n* [Comments](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/#HComments)\n* [Attachments](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/#HAttachments)\n* [History](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/#HHistory)\n* [Information](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/#HInformation)\n* [Children](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/#HChildren)\n\n## Code\n\nYou can view the content of a page without having to edit it (and thus you don't need edit rights). This option is shown only for users in [Advanced Mode](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing#HAdvancedMode).\n\nTo see the code when using the Flamingo skin, you have to go to the More Actions menu, in Viewers menu sub-section, and click on Source.\n\n![ViewSourceFlamingo.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/ViewSourceFlamingo.png?rev=1.4)\n\n![WikiCodeResultFlamingo.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/WikiCodeResultFlamingo.png?rev=1.4)\n\n## Comments\n\nUsers with the comment right can leave comments on pages. This allows them to provide feedback without requiring edit rights.\n\nThe comments area is located in the first tab at the bottom of the page.  \n![CreateCommentTab.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/CreateCommentTab.png?rev=1.1)\n\nThe comment form is not displayed by default, a comment button allows you to display the comment form if needed.\n\n![no_comment.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/no_comment.png?rev=1.1)  \n![two_comments.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/two_comments.png?rev=1.1)  \n![comment.gif](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/comment.gif?rev=1.1)\n\nYou can also click the ![PageActionsMenuButton.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/PageActionsMenuButton.png?rev=1.1)\u00a0button and click on \"Comments\" in the \"Viewers\" section.  \n![AddComment.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/WebHome/AddComment.png?rev=1.5)\n\nOn the Flamingo skin, this is the current look of the comments.
