I just updated to 3.4. I changed the PermGenSpace to 1g. It starts, but everytime I let apache manager do a reload because I changed a conf setting the Java hangs and I am out of PermGenSpace. During startup I get a LOT of complaints like \"SEVERE: The web application [/xwiki] appears to have started a thread named [EvictionTimer-0] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.\". What is happening here?

 \n13:17\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0i think memory leak growing slowly  \n13:17\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0i mean tomcat actually segfaulted multiple times saying \"out of memory\" in the logs  \n13:18\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0i don't know what relationship images and multimedia content have  \n13:18\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0but i do have quite a few photos within the \"photo album\" plugin  \n13:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea but could be a huge attachment filling the memory or something like that which is really not the same thing as something leaking memory  \n13:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0thing is I don't remember any known memory leak in 3.1.1  \n13:19\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0with 3.1.1 is much more stable  \n13:19\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0i mean my Xwiki has been up for weeks now without any issues  \n13:19\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0or my Java process restart script :-)  \n13:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ho ok I tough you had \u00a0the issue with 3.1.1  \n13:20\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0currently thre is a bit of swap being shown which i posted the top output above  \n13:20\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0but that's probably normal  \n13:20\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0i mean the server in general is pretty loaded with 2x tomcat instances 2x postgres instances  \n13:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea it's java reserving what you told it too reserve  \n13:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think  \n13:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you could reduce a bit the allocated memory  \n13:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0-Xmx3072m is pretty big  \n13:26\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:58\u00a0<recompile>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:31\u00a0<kayasaman>\u00a0the xiwkibot seems to be working again! :-)  \n14:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea, restarted xwiki.org  \n14:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like at some point something is breaking it  \n14:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which is not fixed by restarting just the bot itself  \n14:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0committers: anyone whiling to be the build manager this week ?
