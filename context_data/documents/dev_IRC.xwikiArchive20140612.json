I want to check if the page exists first using ajax. \u00a0Can someone recommend how I can do this?  \n08:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spawn57\\_: the best for performance is probably to do a REST request and check if HTTP code is not 404  \n08:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI#HPageresources  \n08:58\u00a0<spawn57\\_>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks, that what I was thinking. \u00a0Learning prototype now.  \n08:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0either that or a usual URL but with /get/ instead of /view/  \n08:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(get action does not execute the skin and is not stored in statistics among other things)  \n08:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I thin REST is the quickest  \n08:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*think  \n09:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n09:19\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n09:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:30\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: extension tests are failing and I couldn't create a new wiki on a recent snapshot of 6.1 because the UI install didn't work (I haven't investigates to see why)  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: checking  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0how recent was the XE you tested ? maybe there was some stuff missing if it was yesterday  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: what is weird is that the ui test we have related to wiki creation seems to build well  \n09:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it didn't work for me, but I'll check with the latest snapshot  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(xwiki-platform-wiki-test-tests)  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well it build on jenkins at least  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but xwiki-platform-wiki-test-tests is not a full XE, maybe there is some other module creating issue  \n10:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n10:51\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:52\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Good morning  \n11:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:52\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:09\u00a0<spawn57\\_>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys I'm having again a problem understanding git history  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm trying to check the history for menuview.vm  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I see only 1 commit  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but this file has been there for a long time  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any idea?

by removing the event with observation.removeEvent(getName(), event)?  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vierfzweievieraz: why a loop ?  \n16:03\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0imlements EventListener -> onEvent (DocumentUpdatedEvent) -> (manipulate content and call xwiki.saveDocument(document, context) \u00a0) - event calls the eventListener again...  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't do that  \n16:04\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0what exactly?  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0listen to DocumentUpdatingEvent, modify the passed XWikiDocument and let XWiki save it for you  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should also make sure to modify the document only if needed (if you were you would not have a loop)  \n16:05\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0how can i let xwiki do that for me?  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DocumentUpdatingEvent is notified before the document is saved  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it will be saved  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't have anything to do  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the idea here is to modify it right before it's saved  \n16:06\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0so just call setDocument? that's it?  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't know any setDocument  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: how is it going? :)  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the first parameter of the event comming with DocumentUpdatingEvent is the XWikiDocument that is going to be saved  \n16:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just modify it  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: on my side I'm testing the scripting API ATM  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(between conf calls ;))  \n16:07\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0my fault i meant document.setContent(xdom)  \n16:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n16:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just that  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but make sure you modify the document passed with the even and not to get the document from XWiki class  \n16:08\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0alright  \n16:09\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0@vincent: on my side i'm on the test of creating html body part with embedded images  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: any problem? do you need help?  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Lyes: btw you should check my integration test  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vierfzweievieraz: by the way DocumentUpdatingEvent may not be enough, you probably need to listen DocumentCreatingEvent no ?  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I used the Part.writeTo() api  \n16:10\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0it worked just fine, thank you!  \n16:13\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0@vincent: I also use Part.writeTo() api  \n16:15\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0you are right, i am going to need the createdevent also... thax again  \n16:18\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0\\*thanks  \n16:28\u00a0<vierfzweievieraz>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0If I found a \"bug\" in the MoccaCalender what is the best way to report it?
