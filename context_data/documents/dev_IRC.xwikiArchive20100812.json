I am going to make a maven central distribution of the core code for keygen that will be used by Clerezza too  \nbblfish - (16:07): then you can take the pieces I have for xwiki and add it to your repo if you want  \nbblfish - (16:08): mind you it looks like you have already integrated a lot of this  \ncjdelisle - (16:08): Pretty much all except the IE support. I don't have windows so I couldn't do any testing.  \nbblfish - (16:09): well I'll point you to the library. Sometime it can help to have common shared code...  \ncjdelisle - (16:09): And I don't have the end which does https with client cert.  \nbblfish - (16:10): ah mind you your code is LGPL whereas the code we are publishing is BSD  \ncjdelisle - (16:10): Does foafssl have a version number in the cert?  \nbblfish - (16:10): the version I am distributing has a specific DN. But that has not been formally decided yet  \nsburjan left at 16:11 (Ping timeout: 258 seconds  \ncjdelisle - (16:11): K so the only part that matters is the webid extension?  \nbblfish - (16:11): yes the SAN  \nbblfish - (16:11): though it may help further down to have an agreed on CN  \nbblfish - (16:11): or perhaps just a OU  \ncjdelisle - (16:12): Ok, then our stuff is compatible.  \nbblfish - (16:12): yes, nobody is checking that  \ncjdelisle - (16:12): Can I recommend adding a number like 0.1 somewhere?  \nbblfish - (16:12): now if you want to see a very interesting implementation of foaf+ssl in Scala that was placed directly in the ssl layer...  \nbblfish - (16:13): I think the only place to put that is somwhere in the DN  \ncjdelisle - (16:13): I have a touch time reading non java/c/perl languages.  \nbblfish - (16:13): no need to read it really, the interesting thing is that it can be done.  \ncjdelisle - (16:13): right now our dn has only the user name in the form xwiki:XWiki.JohnSmith  \nbblfish - (16:14): the CAs DN?  \nbblfish - (16:14): yes  \nbblfish - (16:14): or the subject DN  \ncjdelisle - (16:14): No the user cert dn. The reason is because I wanted to make the signatures as small as possible.  \nbblfish - (16:14): that is premature optimisiation  \nbblfish - (16:15): the CN of the user should be a human readable string  \nbblfish - (16:15): it's what most browsers present to the user  \nbblfish - (16:15): so I have \"bblfish (xwiki)\" \"bblifhs (home)\" to save me having to look at the SAN  \ncjdelisle - (16:15): We will have signatures in the code if a wiki page so short is important.  \nbblfish - (16:15): ?  \ncjdelisle - (16:16): I have made it able to use crypto.signText in the mozilla browser.  \nbblfish - (16:16): http://esw.w3.org/Foaf%2Bssl/Clients/CertSelection  \nbblfish - (16:17): that shows how the CN is uses in most UIs  \ncjdelisle - (16:18): which part of the cn is that? the UID?  \nbblfish - (16:18): no the CN=  \nbblfish - (16:18): in the DN  \nbblfish - (16:18): the DN is the whole thing  \nbblfish - (16:18): the CN is the Common Name  \ncjdelisle - (16:18): ahh yes.  \nbblfish - (16:18): you should ask the user to set that  \ncjdelisle - (16:19): Maybe I'll add it back in. \u00a0\u00a0IMO it should be set for the user, it's tough enough for a user to make a key without having to name it.  \nbblfish - (16:19): but if you think there should be a version number, that is something to ask on the mailing list - because everyone would have to agree  \nbblfish - (16:20): if you set it for the user, and he ends up having a few, then he's going to be very confused when he selects one  \nbblfish - (16:20): you should just ask him for a mnemonic  \nbblfish - (16:20): and if he does not set \u00a0one, create one  \ncjdelisle - (16:21): maybe something like \"John Smith (www.mycoolwiki.com)  \ncjdelisle - (16:21): \"  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 16:21  \ncjdelisle - (16:22): re the version number, the reason is because we might figure out faster ways to load a cert from a website.  \ncjdelisle - (16:25): so if the cert says the version number it was created with and the site which the user is authenticating with hits the site holding the cert with a header specifying the highest version number it can handle, then maybe in future versions the site only responds with the cert and nothing else?  \ncjdelisle - (16:25): maybe the request is made with a single udp packet?  \ncjdelisle - (16:25): who knows what the future will bring.  \nbblfish - (16:27): yes, it is in fact possible to request only certs from a server signed by a specific CA  \nbblfish - (16:27): and so we could have a specific CA for v1, then one for v2 etc  \nbblfish - (16:27): but it's also a bit tricky for other reasons...  \nbblfish - (16:27): something we need to discuss  \ncjdelisle - (16:29): IMO the version in the cert should only have to do with how the request is sent. EG: if the response will only be the cert and nothing else, the version in the cert is not incremented but the version given in the header (I can accept version...) is.  \ncjdelisle - (16:30): If the request is sent in non-http, (like a udp packet or a specially crafted dns request) then the version number in the cert must be incremented.  \ncjdelisle - (16:31): otherwise old versions will have no idea that they are being given a request in the format of a newer version.  \nbblfish - (16:31): the problem is certs are served at the TLS layer  \nbblfish - (16:31): so things work differently there  \nbblfish - (16:31): it's below http  \nbblfish - (16:32): so unless you want to re-engineer TLS...  \ncjdelisle - (16:32): I'm talking about the request to the home site which holds the modulus (?)  \ncjdelisle - (16:32): So foafssl-request-version goes in the cert and foafssl-response-version is sent in the header of the request.  \ncjdelisle - (16:33): the numbers specify the highest version which the foafssl installation can handle.  \ncjdelisle - (16:34): I guess a foafssl-response-version should be in the response as well, that way the requester knows what they are reading.  \nbblfish - (16:34): ah  \nbblfish - (16:34): for creating the key you can do what you want  \nbblfish - (16:34): since you control the server  \nbblfish - (16:34): it's a form. So you can pass any paramters you want  \nbblfish - (16:35): but probably you just want to ask your user for a DN, and perhaps an expiry date  \ncjdelisle - (16:35): The event I'm talking about is then somebody authenticates with website alice but he is a member of website bob. Alice must make a request to bob.  \ncjdelisle - (16:36): and it's in everyone's favor to make that request go as quickly as possible.  \nbblfish - (16:37): ah ok  \nMartinCleaver\\_ joined #xwiki at 16:37  \nbblfish - (16:37): there you can do two things, you can check your cache  \nbblfish - (16:37): first  \nbblfish - (16:37): to see if he has already logged in  \nbblfish - (16:38): then you can do a conditional GET request  \nbblfish - (16:38): if you have something  \nbblfish - (16:38): that may be out of date  \nMartinCleaver left at 16:39 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nMartinCleaver\\_ is now known as MartinCleaver ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \n\n"}
