I would like to know if there are any requirements to met in order to become admin on l10n.xwiki.org.

I'm jus testing it  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*just  \n16:13\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0It's a different approach with similar goals as XMPP  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: yes you just install the extension and it support xwiki/1.0 syntax, same limitation that other syntax like markdown is that you won't have a WYSIWYG for it since there is no renderer  \n16:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Hah that's neat  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same as when you install any other syntax renderer actually  \n16:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Probably a good alternative to using oldrendering if someone requires 1.0 because they have tons of documentation in syntax 1.0 don't but they don't have any horrible code-heavy pages which cause serious compatibility issues  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes in many cases it's probably enough  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(minus that it's not maintained anymore and it might still contain bugs)  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(well anyone could continue working on it actually)  \n16:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oldrendering same (and probably more bugs)  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: you have a bug in CategoriesCode's #getCategoryName  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0leading to http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13220#  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm going to set some variable about the current doc in the context  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that it works when called from a panel or from a wiki page  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the bug is in using $doc  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when in a panel this should be $panelDoc)  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$paneldoc actually  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's a pain btw to write code that works both in panels and in wiki pages  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess we should have kept $doc as the panel doc  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and instead introduce some other binding when in a panel to mean the enclosing doc  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to be hard to change now...  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: yes but expected bugs :) It's mostly used to have the exact same behavior it used to  \n16:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0heh  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok I'll check if $paneldoc is set and use it so and otherwise use $doc, that's the simplest for now without breaking any api  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one BFD :)  \n16:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for me)  \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0me too, before :P  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone taking https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-439 ?  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyone who take XRENDERING-439 should also do XRENDERING-399 at the same time probably  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lookings at https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-935 on my side, fun one  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea1: I don't get the issue in the gwt wysiwyg btw  \n16:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0according to the issue it should be easy to reproduce in a xhtml module unit test, no need for the WYSIWYG  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: marius closed it as a dup but I had tested it in the GWT WYSIWYG and ti works fine there so I don't know what's different between the 2 editors  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah wait  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm using a wrong input  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forget it  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mixed up two issues I'm looking at at the same time  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grrrr  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0having problems with my IDE in rendering  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because of ListBLock vs ListBlock  \n16:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0there are two classes called ListBLock and ListBlock ?

I have a list of user to inject in a group  \n18:38\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0or I must add XWiki.XWikiGroups object and save add another one and save ?  \n18:39\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0with groovy  \n18:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no idea if there is any API for that, I would do it trough xobjects I think  \n18:40\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0trough xobjects? like that? MyGroup.newObject('XWiki.XWikiGroups') and gObj.set('member',udoc.fullName) ?  \n18:41\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0vmassol, tmortagne: is it normal that icon transformations are execute inside {{velocity wiki=\"false\"}} ?
