But night is not long enough! :-)  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:16): OK, the problem is \"clear\" now. But I do need to find an alternative to the control of some simple characteristics in exported rtf files  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:17): I need to deliver a report within these coming two or three days, and export to rtf controlling images sizes, <p> fonts style and space before and after headings are the keys.  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:19): that should be easy  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:19): Of course I can modify this characteristics by hand, but this won't be nice to try to justify this need :-(  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:19): it should! But I don't find how to do that.  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:19): injecting the right css should do the trick  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:20): barring any css4j bug since sergiu seemed to consider it was buggy or limited  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:20): It seems it doesn't. For instance, we can control image width, but length seems not affected  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:20): css4j seems to be the problem  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:20): actually I don't see any css4j in the applyCSS ethod  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:20): method  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:21): ah sorry  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:21): it's there  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:21): I've been trying to go deep into css4j, but once again is kind of Sanskrit for me right now!  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:23): did you check the xhtml doc before applying the css and after applying it?  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:23): that's what I would do  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:23): got to go now, lunch time  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:23): enjoy!  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:24): checking xhtml doc does imply debugging, doesn't it?  \nvmassol - (18/05/2008 12:28): you could put debug logs in the source code but you'll need to rebuild from sources of course  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:29): ok, thanks. Clearly I've to face this build issue if I want to help here.  \nrrodriguez - (18/05/2008 12:31): it will be great to solve these image size and margins issues before that occurs, but I can solve the urgent manually if we don't find any alternative. No nice, but possible.
