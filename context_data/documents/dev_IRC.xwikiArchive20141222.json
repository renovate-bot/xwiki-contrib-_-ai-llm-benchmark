 \n11:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes it is  \n11:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have written a comment in the source code  \n12:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:31\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:33\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:34\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:44\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: the compilation is broken because of the class ExtensionRating which is missing in xwiki-platform-repository-server-api  \n13:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: are you aware about that?  \n13:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ExtensionRating has nothing to do with xwiki-platform-repository-server-api it's part of xwiki-commons-extension-api  \n13:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and as far as I can see it's there and xwiki-platform-repository-server-api does not give me any missing class in Eclipse  \n13:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually there is two, one in xwiki-commons-extension-api and the other in xwiki-commons-repository-model but both are here (otherwise commons itself could not build) so it's weird  \n13:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually it was building well and it started failing without any change to those classes  \n13:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe trigger the commons build on jenkins a second time? \u00a0locally if I have weird missing dependency problems, running maven a second time fixes this sometimes.  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is something very weird on maven.xwiki.org snapshot repository, all the 6.4-SNAPSHOT jar I see on http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/commons/ are very old  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons-properties/6.4-SNAPSHOT/  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a004-Dec-2014  \n13:28\u00a0<mosulica>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0repository model is 01-Dec-2014  \n13:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it's indeed far from being up to date...  \n13:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0forcing commons rebuild  \n13:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0not all jar, for example http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons-crypto-common/6.4-SNAPSHOT/ \u00a0is current ... but a lot of them are  \n13:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0weird enough in any case  \n13:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all the current jars are just been built  \n13:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. after whatever happend  \n13:44\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n13:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example in http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/commons/xwiki-commons-crypto-common/6.4-SNAPSHOT/ you have two dates  \n13:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the old 04-Dec-2014 and the new 22-Dec-2014 that just been built  \n13:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, build on jenkins succeeded  \n13:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for some reason the snapshot repository has been reseted to an old state  \n13:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so maybe I have been looking while the build was already running ...  \n13:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking released jars  \n13:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hope it's only snapshot...  \n13:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0releases seems ok so it's something related to snapshots  \n13:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but according to Nexus log, its snapshot cleanup has been run last night  \n13:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, the last common-build \u00a0is from 04.12. (except for #105, which only buils a subset, for some reason)  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm #103 to #107 have been built today but they all seems very limited indeed, but I have the right model since a while without building it so I don't understand  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway it should be ok now  \n14:13\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:28\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n14:34\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:35\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:42\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:04\u00a0<alex\\_ccr>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:05\u00a0<alex\\_ccr>\u00a0Hi, I've a trouble deleting a wiki page (created from an Office document).
