Re your mail I'm assuming this was caused by one of my changes re reference refactoring. Is that it?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:00): Good morning. Yes, and I think I know how to fix it.  \nvmassol - (08:00): oh cool, I was going to debug it :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:01): You said in a comment that DocumentEntityReference is not used in xclasses. Not true.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:02): It points to the document where the class is defined.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:03): addUserToGroup depends on this.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:04): memberObject.setXClassReference(groupClass.getXClassReference());  \nvmassol - (08:04): you mean that getXClassReference() is not used in XClass?  \nvmassol - (08:05): right, didn't see your last line  \nvmassol - (08:05): that said I don't know why it would fail (that line)  \nvmassol - (08:06): I don't recall doing anything special for XClass  \nsdumitriu - (08:06): vmassol: Did you revert the change on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SurveyXWikiFeatures ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:06): It doesn't, it just returns null.  \nvmassol - (08:06): s/XClass/BaseClass/  \nvmassol - (08:06): sdumitriu: yes  \nvmassol - (08:07): CalebJamesDeLisl: do you know why it's not set?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:07): When you call getXClass in XWikiDocument, the name is set to the document name, the reference is not set.  \nvmassol - (08:08): CalebJamesDeLisl: I don't think it was set before was it?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:08): Isn't the reference replacing the name?  \nvmassol - (08:08): yes but I've never dropped any call  \nvmassol - (08:08): I've jsut replaced get/setName by get/getDcoumentRefernce  \nvmassol - (08:08): and   \nsdumitriu - (08:09): Going to sleep  \nvmassol - (08:09): get/setClassName by get/setXClassRefrence  \nsdumitriu - (08:09): vmassol: Sorry, I didn't have time to commit the color themes  \nsdumitriu - (08:09): Too much cleanup  \nvmassol - (08:09): sdumitriu: ok will make it in 2.3 then  \nvmassol - (08:09): have a good night  \nsdumitriu - (08:09): Branch today?  \nvmassol - (08:09): we could  \nvmassol - (08:10): after the release maybe  \nvmassol - (08:10): I would also like to have one  \nsdumitriu - (08:10): K, bye  \nvmassol - (08:10): breakfast time, CalebJamesDeLisl , I'll be back in 20 mn  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:10): XWikiDocument.getXClass() sets the name if the class is new, it doesn't however set the reference. This is why it is null.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:11): Enjoy your breakfast.  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 08:13  \nvmassol - (08:17): CalebJamesDeLisl: what needs to be checked is why it was wroking before and not anymore  \nvmassol - (08:17): (to be sure we don't introduce a different behavior somewhere)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:18): Well what was working is the livetable for XWikiAllUsers showed all of the users, now it only shows the admin.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:21): It's more correct to say that adding users makes them not show up on the livetable.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:23): Okay, I looked a little more closely, ClassReference replaces className which I don't remember being used for classes.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:23): memberObject.setXClassReference(groupClass.getXClassReference()); \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So this is clearly wrong.  \nvmassol - (08:24): we still need to understand why it was working  \nvmassol - (08:24): it may be a question of null  \nvmassol - (08:25): since before there could have been a check for null or \"\" and now since it's resolved as ref it maybe cannot be null anymore  \nvmassol - (08:25): that would explain the Main.WebHome  \nvmassol - (08:25): if you resolve \"\" it'll give Main.WebHome when using a default resolver  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:29): Look at what the line used to be (in the email) It looks like it was getting the name of the document where the class was defined.  \nvmassol - (08:29): brb (shower time)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:30): I'll keep investigating.  \nvmassol - (08:39): CalebJamesDeLisl: IMO memberObject.setXClassReference was set to \"\" (empty string)  \nvmassol - (08:40): do you know the place where it's used and causing the problem?  \nvmassol - (08:40): saveXWikiCollection?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:40): It ends up saving the class as Main.WebHome in the database.  \nvmassol - (08:41): ok debugging  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:41): memberObject.setClassName(groupClass.getName());  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:41): This gets the name of the document where the class was defined.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:42): memberObject.setXClassReference(groupClass.getXClassReference());  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:42): This gets null.  \nvmassol - (08:42): oh I made a mistake then  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:42): I think you wanted memberObject.setXClassReference(groupClass.getDocumentReference());  \nvmassol - (08:42): yes  \nvmassol - (08:42): looks like it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:43): It's horribly confusing.  \nvmassol - (08:45): good catch!  \nvmassol - (08:45): and sorry about that  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:45): No pb.  \nvmassol - (08:45): are you committing the fix?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:45): No  \nvmassol - (08:45): I can do it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:45): It's your code.  \nvmassol - (08:46): oh you can change any code  \nvmassol - (08:46): in general  \nvmassol - (08:46): I can do it here  \nvmassol - (08:46): thought you wanted to reap the awards of fixing a bug! :)  \nvmassol - (08:46): (that would be normal)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:46): meh  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:47): It may be the only thing I'm good at but I can trace the line of execution pretty well.  \nvmassol - (08:47): :)  \nvmassol - (08:47): I'm sure you're goog at a lot of things  \nvmassol - (08:47): s/goog/good/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:48): On another note I think I might send a proposal to the list to start working on putting StringListProp in a separate table, The need for the classType column adds an inner join to literally every db query.  \nvmassol - (08:48): ok committed  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:49): Great, can't wait to see what the test says.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:49): You must have noticed my hack to make the tests pass with LiveValidation.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:50): I really like that functional testing stuff, I just need to get better at it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:51): I ran those tests with and without LiveValidation, waitForElement and waitForText work either way.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:55): GWT 2.0 WYSIWYG \u00a0\u00a0\"Compiling 56 permutations\" \u00a0What?!  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 09:13  \nnuvolari - (09:13): on the topic of GWT, may I ask a question related to cross-domain posting?

The idea is to download only the code that is needed. If you want to build the WYSIWYG locally, then I recoment using -Pdev which generates only one permutation (FF3+en, around 50seconds).  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:24): Thanks.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:25  \nvmassol - (10:26): mflorea: that would be a good tip for the Building page IMO  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 10:28  \nmflorea - (10:28): vmassol: I could add a subsection of http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Building#HBuildingwithMaven to refer to building the WYSIWYG module  \nvmassol - (10:31): yep  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:36): Haha, fixed the watchlist test. It wanted to be at the watchlist manager before setting the duration.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:37): BTW: Is there a way to get to the watchlist manager without entering the url?  \nvmassol - (10:41): CalebJamesDeLisl: sure  \nvmassol - (10:41): move your mouse to your logged user name  \nvmassol - (10:41): in the top right location of the screen  \nvmassol - (10:41): in the menu that opens, select watchlist  \nvmassol - (10:41): or just go to your profile and click on the watchlist tab  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:41): http://127.0.0.1:8081/xwikiTrunk/bin/view/XWiki/Admin?category=watchlist \u00a0\u00a0this?  \nvmassol - (10:42): I don't know the url  \nvmassol - (10:42): you were asking without using a url :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:42): That's what I get when I follow your instruction, but I need this:  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:42): http://127.0.0.1:8081/xwikiTrunk/bin/edit/XWiki/WatchListManager  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:43): I hate to alter a test, but it looks like that's what it was supposed to go to.  \nvmassol - (10:43): it doesn't exist any more  \nvmassol - (10:43): JV forgot to refactor the test to use the new watch list manager  \nvmassol - (10:44): new watch list manager = watchlist tab of your profile  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:44): Ok  \nvmassol - (10:44): JV= Jean-Vincent  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:44): I don't see a place to set the duration between mail.  \nvmassol - (10:44): it's there  \nvmassol - (10:44): I've nsee it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:44): Without going into objects...  \nvmassol - (10:45): seen  \nvmassol - (10:45): let me start XE  \nEnygma` - (10:47): Hi guys... I`m trying to inititalize a component and I need access to an XWiki Document.

What other option do I have to retrieve a document at component initialization time?  \nvmassol - (10:47): CalebJamesDeLisl: you go to the watchlist tab  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:47): Yes...  \nvmassol - (10:47): CalebJamesDeLisl: and you can see on the left part \"Watchlist Prefrences\"  \nvmassol - (10:47): CalebJamesDeLisl: to change it, click the edit button  \nvmassol - (10:48): (and select the watchlist tab again, that's a pain, it should remember where we are)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:48): Which edit button? the one at the top left?  \nvmassol - (10:49): note: I don't like this new way of doing it.

I discussed it yesterday here with sdumitriu. The edit menu has a big z-index specified (instead of the sub menu that is opened when you click the menu) and thus it is displayed above the glass panel used by the WYSIWYG editor.
