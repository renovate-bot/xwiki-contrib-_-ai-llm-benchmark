\n13:12\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0:)  \n13:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The reddit people are using the elastic storage for their databases and they have some horror tales about them.  \n13:13\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0ahh :/  \n13:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The solution is just use Amazon with an ephimeral disk instead of the elastic storage.

 \n13:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0+1  \n13:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'd rather go towards OpenStack or other open cloud infrastructures  \n13:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0GAE is really cool but it's proprietary and it only supports version 1 of DN.  \n13:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0DN is version 2.0 final and 3.0M3  \n13:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I would suggest that google isn't really serious about java support, GAE is more of a python thing.  \n13:17\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0it started as python right  \n13:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I asked about java in #appengine and people were like
