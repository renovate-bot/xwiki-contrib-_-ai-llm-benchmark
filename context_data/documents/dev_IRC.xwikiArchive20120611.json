If that's true then there's an important bug in maven and we can certainly find a jira issue about it and add it to our pom.xml doc  \n08:53\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Not sure even what to search for  \n08:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my guess  \n08:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that this was introduced by my recent upgrade of some maven plugins  \n08:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from yesterday  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I don't see which plugin could have caused this  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah there's one  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the enforcer plugin  \n08:55\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0was plugin plugin upgraded?  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the error is from the enforcer plugin right?  \n08:55\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0yes  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so it must come from that  \n08:56\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0perhaps it was this way and it just \"worked\" even though it was broken?

 \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it's too late sburjan  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless you don't find any bug  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:24\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Friday I tested the installers  \n09:24\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and then it was weekend  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we should release it today  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then we have 1 week to find and fix any blocking bug till the final  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(final is planned for 18th)  \n09:25\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0also the release process is a total mess in my head after so many votes and discussions. someone should send a digest of what we finally decided  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep same for me  \n09:25\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I'm basicly following orders as given by vmassol :)  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: in this case please continue as we were doing FTM  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie we release rc1 today as usual and release final on next Monday  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then we can talk about doing things differently  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally sorin's job is to test at least RC1  \n09:27\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I wrote to the list to try to document what we discussed, it would be nice to hear an ack from you to make sure it wasn't misunderstood  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I parked your email to read it slowly  \n09:27\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0[xwiki-devs] [Proposal] Change to the 4.1-rc-1 and 4.1 release process.  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you should know that I'm going to a conferecne on thursday/friday and I need to prepare my talk so I'm not going to have much time at the beginning of this week  \n09:29\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes well I will test RC-1, but that usually requires at least one day. one day which I didn't have  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: RC1 is not releaed  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I don't understand your point  \n09:30\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0cool and good luck, just a plain ack or \"change this then ack\" is enough.  \n09:30\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0sburjan: I think vmassol's saying that it's fine to do post-rc1-release testing.  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep as we've done so far  \n09:30\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ah ok  \n09:30\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you'll get your one day :)  \n09:30\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yeah :)  \n09:31\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0for RC that makes sense, for final, testing after release is D: but that's something to work on.  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well RC is for that  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to have a perfect final  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bugs that still happen in final are fixed in point releases if blockers  \n09:32\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0yes, renaming the rc to final would work. making changes to an rc then building it as final is the problem.  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not that bad  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because our build is automated  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and so far I don't remember any issue we've had with this  \n09:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not like our build was giving random results ;)  \n09:33\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0the issue is that the changes to the RC don't go through manual testing themselves..  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep sure  \n09:33\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Perhaps it is a smaller issue than I make it out to be since the changes are theoretically small.  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why we should accept only real blockers (thus not a lot) and small stuff + have all our eyes on it  \n09:34\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n09:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cjd: the blockers do.. so we confirm they are fixed before finalr elease  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: replied  \n09:41\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0yes, my proposal was to just stage once and not re-stage at all until it's time to release.  \n09:41\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0and in this case the whole idea of staging is basicly optional  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: creating jira issue for maven  \n09:43\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0anyone have any concerns with me starting now? I'd like to get this done quickly and I have a feeling sdumitriu will be in bed for the next few (or many) hours.  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: reported as http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MENFORCER-133  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0adding it to our pom.xml  \n09:46\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0thanks, maven is such a magic black box for me, I can't even really tell if things like that are bugs or features :/  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's supposed to be a black box ;)  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only issue with black box is when they fail...  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*boxes  \n09:48\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0also they are not intuitive to use (for me) because you can't see how the inputs connect to the outputs  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure it's an act of faith  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to trust the documentation  \n09:49\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0yeah, I'm just not wired for it.. I've never found a piece of documentation I couldn't throw out and go read the code.  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well you can do that with mavne if you so wishes  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's open source and the source is ready to find  \n09:50\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0yeap, I just dare not look at it  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I do that regularly  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on plugins  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's easy  \n09:50\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I imagine hundreds of XWikiDocument like classes...  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0heh  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's much nicer  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the archietcture is quite nice  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0missing a lot of javadoc though  \n09:51\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0that's good to hear  \n09:52\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0oh we must have a debate on the rich v. anemic domain models when you have time.  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep in july  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seminar  \n09:52\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0sounds good  \n09:53\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Well I'm going to start and hope that nobody is in bed and needs to commit late patches.  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sounds good  \n09:54\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0tmortagne: there are a couple issues here without documentation:  \n09:54\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/IssueNavigator!eecuteAdvanced.jspa?jqlQuery=Project+in+%28%22XWiki+Commons%22%2C+%22XWiki+Rendering%22%2C+%22XWiki+Platform%22%2C+%22XWiki+Enterprise%22%2C+%22XWiki+Enterprise+Manager%22%29+and+fixVersion+in+%28%224.1-rc-1%22%29+and+resolution+in+%28%22Fixed%22%29+and+%28%28Documentation+is+EMPTY%29+or+%28%22Documentation+in+Release+Notes%22+is+EMPTY%29%29&runQuery=true&clear=true  \n09:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0always forget to set it in the jira issue, looking  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep a mail has been sent to all committers this morning  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thomas has 2 and AndreasJonsson has one  \n09:55\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Andreas looks to have fixed it. It's a security issue so likely undocumented.. That's another topic for discussion, how to document those.  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do document those  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've already had this discussion  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIR we just mention \"security fixes\" in the RN without giving too many details  \n09:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0fixed, I just forgot N/A  \n09:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0usually don't forget when there is something to put in it  \n09:58\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I've probably mellowed a bit on it all but my feeling is \"argitrary filesystem read access by registered users, bug fixed\" is the right approach. To some users it's just a bug.  \n09:58\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0and some users would be scared and confused with the FUD the security industry pumps out  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: you're rigth though. We've had the discussion but I think it was on skype and I don't think we have published the result on xwiki.org  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks ok  \n09:59\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I guess the sec industry turns everything into a life-or-death disaster  \n10:03\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:04\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0jvdrean: good morning, anything holding up -rc-1 on your end?  \n10:05\u00a0<+jvdrean>\u00a0cjd: Hi, no  \n10:06\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0great  \n10:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: got an idea and commented on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7894  \n10:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I see you made some upgrades and closed the issue with N/A for release notes, but we have a Upgrades section in the release notes.

 \n10:43\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0it \\*looks\\* like it's from your patch to permissions and it's just harmlessly causing the test setup to no longer make sense but I want a second opinion.  \n10:50\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I'm going to go ahead since this is a minor test, it's failing in the setup, not what it's designed to check, any change to the permissions system is likely to trigger this test to fail.  \n11:01\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0cjd: I'm loking at it...  \n11:07\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0he can't edit the admin object because his permission isn't a global permission  \n11:07\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0so the test is bunk  \n11:07\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0that's what I'm getting from watching the test  \n11:07\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0in which case we can remove the test since it's checking for something that will never happen  \n11:17\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0cjd: Indeed, admin rights should have been assigned with a global rights object. \u00a0What really worries me is the fact that the test seems to have worked before ...  \n11:19\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0it seems natural that it would have worked before since the user had the permission  \n11:19\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0cjd: Ok, the test worked because someJoker didn't really have admin rights only \"document admin\" on XWiki.XWikiPreference (which could have been exploited to elevate privileges to admin, but noone would have actually configured \"document admin\" on XWiki.XWikiPreferences)  \n11:19\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0giving him global permission will make the test fail because he becomes authorized and thus the check nolonger makes ant sense.  \n11:20\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0yes, thats true.  \n11:20\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0it was just setup that way, what it was checking was that you can't create a document and put a ConfigurableClass object in it and use that to cease control.  \n11:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:27\u00a0<Rich\\_Morin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:29\u00a0<Rich\\_Morin>\u00a0I found an ugly typo on the XW site. \u00a0I then spent about 10 minutes trying to find a simple way to report it. \u00a0Every page I went to wanted me to fill out a survey, log into a bug reporting mechanism, etc. \u00a0Is there an email address I can use to report a web site problem?
