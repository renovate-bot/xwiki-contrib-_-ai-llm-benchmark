We have the flexabulity now. If we can get security (be default, not be fixing all (known) bugs) and we can get speed, then we will be the best thing out there by far.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:08): s/be/by  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:09): I am quite intrigued by the idea of making everything secure at once rather than by laborious code review.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:10): I suspect there will be a lot of chatting to come before we have a coherent proposal.  \nvmassol - (00:10): yes  \njvdrean left at 00:10 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:11): I like automation of tests, and it seems natural that security should be automated as well.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:12): Not sure if you're interested in the security paper, but I'm interested in sharing the link :) \u00a0http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf  \nvmassol - (00:13): thanks, not sure I'll read it anytime soon though :) Got to go now.
