I've created XWIKI-12923 and i've come with two possible solutions. Personally I would go with second solution as it's more flexible. If it doesn't sound to you as an unnecessary thing, i will implement it and propose PR. Thanks  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Hi DarkKnightCZ sorry I'm on holidays ATM don't have much time. Looks good. Enygma would be the best person to validate since he's the one who created the realtime watchlist but he's on holidays too ATM. You could do a first PR doing what you think is best IMO  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks!  \n17:25\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0vmassol: yup, that's okay for me, thanks for your time... enjoy holidays :)  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thx  \n18:07\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:37\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
