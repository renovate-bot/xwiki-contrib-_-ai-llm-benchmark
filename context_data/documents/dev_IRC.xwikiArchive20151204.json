 \n15:00\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, +1  \n15:01\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Indeed my intention was to only load things in our fonts dir  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok I will create a jira issue about it then and probably bring this up for 8.0, not sure it's a good idea to do it right now  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0thanks  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: hi! since you're here, you're missing some doc for issues you closed and this is preventing finalizing the 7.4M1 release, see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleasePlans/ReleasePlan74M1  \n15:03\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0One thing that may break is embedded SVGs, but I'm not sure  \n15:03\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The rasterizer probably uses its own fonts  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: do you think you could check this out? shouldn't take long  \n15:03\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually forget about the rasterizer, it's not used  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: the way I implemented it for FOP 2.0 upgrade is that you can add system font just by putting <auto-detect/> in fop-config.xml so that should be ok I think  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. loading system fonts is just more or less configuration  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12877  \n15:09\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:54\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:13\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:02\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<gene>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:29\u00a0<gene>\u00a0Hi, I was hoping to try out xwiki but it looks like the playground wiki doesn't have editing enabled for registered users?
