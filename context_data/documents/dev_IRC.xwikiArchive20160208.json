(or which container/version are you using ?)  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: myxwiki.org is using 7.0.52 as far as I can see but I'm not really the best one to ask for recommended Tomcat version, I don't really know any unrecommended version of Tomcat  \n11:39\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, I'm asking because we are running 8.0.14 but we still experience those sessions stealing :/  \n11:40\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0And I want to change of tomcat major version to test out  \n11:41\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0What we have also noticed is , once logged in the website, even with the \"remember me\" unchecked, the session stick forever  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"remember me\" is a XWiki thing to store user in the cookie but I don't think it has much impact of the actual session  \n11:41\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, so my analysis is sessions are stored by tomcat, which can be an issue somewhere  \n11:42\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0as session are stored in memory in tomcat, by default  \n11:43\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, but do you confirm this is not the expected behavior that the session last apparently forever ?  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0storing the sessions on FS does not seems like a very safe thing to do so I guess default is memory, when I think about sessions I expect them to be reseted when I restart  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I'm really not a Tomcat expert  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: what makes you think the sessions last forever ? maybe you are misleaded by XWiki automatically logging it with whatis stored in the cookie  \n11:44\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0yes maybe I'm misleaded somewhere  \n11:45\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I don't understand that much how sessions works  \n11:45\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0But what I expect is, after a given amount of time, you are being logged out  \n11:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0usually you loose the sessions after some timeout or when you close your browser so it depends what is the timeout on Tomcat side I guess  \n11:49\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, yes, I'm not clear if the session cookie timeout is set by tomcat or by something else  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: that was fast :)  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: now that it's based on a resolved it's super easy to do and test this kind of change  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(but it's possible it broke some other tests)  \n12:22\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0cjd, I saw your name mentioned on the comments of http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Security ; I was wondering if you can help me understand, why the three session cookies mentioned on that page doesn't include a timeout ? Then how is handled the session timeout within xwiki ?  \n12:32\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: I don't know exactly when they expire  \n12:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sorry  \n12:36\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0when thinking more about it, facebook or gmail sessions never expires until you close the browser ...  \n12:40\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0that would mean something is maintaining the server session every X seconds  \n13:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0downloading latest 7.4.1 snapshot to test sibling links  \n13:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: does not seem to be ready yet http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform-7.4.x/103/  \n13:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0still building  \n13:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it`s quicker if you build xwiki-platform-rendering-xwiki locally and switch the jar (if you really want to)  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k thanks  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to build more  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forget that I was not up to date  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool much nicer :)  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so children first and then siblings?  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(sounds logical)  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm question Enygma`: is it normal that [[label>>.page1]] gives a children link if a children page exists?  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm on http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/page2/ and I have http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/page2/page1 and http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/page1/  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do I force a sibling link instead of a children link in my case?  \n13:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0children have priority  \n13:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Have you considered going into politics?  \n13:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for manual siblings, you need to use the absolute reference  \n13:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0cjd: I`m expecting far more jokes about children/sibligns/etc. regarding NestedPages, as I`ve already mentioned on the list :)  \n13:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Giving children priority is guaranteed to improve your approval rating, 9 out of 10 pollsters agree  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: so [[space:page1]] or [[page1.WebHome]] or [[:page1.]]  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok Enygma`, can you explain what the dot in \u00a0[[label>>.page1]] means?  \n14:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0current space  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0page1 is the current space  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's ignored?  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because <currentspace>.<currentspace> doesn't look right  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my bad  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if page1 is the current space, then the link should be page1.page1 or page1.page1.WebHome or page1.WebHome  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm on page2  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*should resolve to  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it means page2.page1 ok  \n14:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yep  \n14:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ve updated the XWikiSyntax page trying to clarigy some details including the algorithm.  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we have to be prepared to answer questions about link references :)  \n14:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*clarify  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's important that it'es clear  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking it  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n14:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:12\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<MasterPiece``>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: i think you've used the wrong mail notification on ci.xwiki.org for contrib projects  \n16:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I've let the default config  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's the problem  \n16:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\"Send e-mail for every unstable build\"  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't use the default :)  \n16:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I can remove this and only enable \"Send separate e-mails to individuals who broke the build\"  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not the problem  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't use the default email notification mechanism  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we use a different plugin  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's configured in a very specific way to avoid sending false positives emails  \n16:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ah ok  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have a script to copy projects  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll work on it to make it work for contrib projects  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm referring to the \"Copy Jobs for a new branch\" scriptlet script  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and to \"Postbuild script to be executed by jobs using the Groovy Postbuild plugin\"  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not this one  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I meant \"Fix Email notifications\"  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me try to run it  \n16:23\u00a0<MasterPiece``>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: just changed the config for all contrib jobs, hope I didn't break too many thingfs ;)  \n16:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n16:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:07\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ohoh  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm is this some kind of spam: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Redmine+Issues#Comments  \n17:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the guy had started a page a week ago.
