It autogenerates a schema even before you import the .xar  \n13:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So when you first start it, you should see a flood of sql queries.  \n13:20\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0start what the wiki or mysql or tomcat6 ?  \n13:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0when xwiki starts but ofc tomcat and mysql would have to be running.  \n13:26\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0ok i cannot find something unusal in the mysql logfile  \n13:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0but you do see traffic coming from xwiki when it starts correct?  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0shutting down mac to install 8GB of RAM!  \n13:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0:) You'd be surprised how fast it disappears  \n13:30\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0ok how can i look at mysql connections  \n13:30\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0in the logfile is just that it did satrt up  \n13:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it's safe to assume that you have a connection to the db since you can see the wiki when you strt it up.  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:33\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0ok than what is blocking the upload of the xar file  \n13:34\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/FhuSVxB5  \n13:34\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0this is what i have done so far  \n13:34\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0this is the documentation i have written for my setup  \n13:34\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0can you see something unusual here?  \n13:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\"uncomment the non neeeded database\" I assume you meant to say \"comment out the unneeded dbs\"  \n13:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0esp. hsqldb which is uncommented to begin with.  \n13:38\u00a0<tuxlover>\u00a0yes thats what i mean  \n13:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Sorry I can't be of much help now.

(with 8GB now :))  \n13:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Well I gotta call it quits. Still a bug preventing rollback from working right with attachments. I can commit and have broken code in the tree or I can sit on 2000 lines and keep working on it on local. WDYT?  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it doesn't break the build nor other xwiki features you can commit if you prefer  \n13:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's close to working, just a matter of interfaces not lining up between attachments and core.  \n13:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It won't break anything unless someone changes xwiki.cfg.  \n13:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok.

 \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: just sent another mail  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's in -default  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's in xwiki-core  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it knows it has to call \"webapp\" because it's xwiki  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and xwiki uses a \"webapp\" environment  \n18:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if it's in xwiki-core then it's ok  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the alternative is WebAppVelocityFactory  \n18:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but why not stay with \"default\" hint and make XWiki overwrite it ?  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I think I prefer an additional param  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we shouldn't bundle anything with overrides  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becuase otherwise it breaks the mechanism  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie not allowing users to provide their own implementations  \n18:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what will be in commons finally ?  \n18:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0from velocity i mean  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0velocity-default at the minimum  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then if we agree to have container  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then we can also have velocity-webapp  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally I think it should be in there  \n18:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what do you have to do to be able to use velocity in commons ?  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0minimal usage is to use -default  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you create an engine using the veloctiy factory impl  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then use the engine  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go  \n18:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bb in a few hours \u2026 sorry have to rush, I'm late  \n18:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n18:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0reading your new mail  \n19:00\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:49\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:10\u00a0<qwebirc75890>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:10\u00a0<qwebirc75890>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<magpi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:16\u00a0<magpi>\u00a0Hi!
