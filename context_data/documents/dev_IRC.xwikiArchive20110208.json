Save the text somewhere :)  \n11:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\\*expire  \n11:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0lucky me! :-D  \n11:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No it won't  \n11:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it usually does for me... IBM proxies...  \n11:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The session will expire, but the form data is saved  \n11:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: mine isn't  \n11:13\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I have to login again, etc etc  \n11:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anyway, please leave me a message when i can post the issue  \n11:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0also, might there be a way to post the updated translation to the svn on a regular basis so they are included in snapshot builds? that might be handy  \n11:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0guys, I found one issue: The form on Panels.NewPage doesn't have an input for the template, and if there are registered template providers then when you submit the form you are not taken to the edit page but the to a form where you have to pick the template. NewPagePanelTest.testCreatePageFromPanel doesn't take this into account. Is this the expected behavior?  \n11:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's acceptable  \n11:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0in this case I have to update the test. The problem is that there are two behaviors (1) when there are template providers registered and (2) when there aren't any. I guess I can check in the test what page is loaded and submit the additional information if required  \n11:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0jstoldt: Can you try Jira now?  \n11:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0XAADMINISTRATION-217  \n11:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0what's annoying is that there are many ui-test that flicker, and I don't see anything wrong with them. I just hope there isn't any bug in selenium. For instance, in SchedulerTest.testSchedulerJobDefaultEditMode there is a click to edit a page and an assert to check if a text is present. If I run the test 10 times it may fail once. If I get the page source before the assert, it never fails..  \n11:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think you can start the release  \n11:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0did you look at the escape test that is failing?  \n11:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I haven't  \n11:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I tried to fix it  \n11:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It says it's a circula redirect, but I don't see how  \n11:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It works locally  \n11:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, I'll go eat something and start the release after  \n11:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: hardcore question. http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/trunk/distribution-test/ui-tests/src/test/it/org/xwiki/test/ui/framework/elements/ViewPage.java We have a method called deleteCurrentPage(). Check also the comment from above it. I added my own method, that is called the same, so we have a naming conflict. What should I do ? I either rename my method, or rename the older method ?  \n11:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0also don't know what name to use, because I try to keep a consistency between copyCurrentPage() and deleteCurrentPage()  \n11:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0the method we have now it'a a full-featured action, it deletes an entire doc . and it's not a test  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: the todo is wrong  \n11:50\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:50\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ViewPage represents a page and all methodes MUST represent user actions the way the users does them  \n11:50\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0Hi!  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0TestUtil can have shortcuts but ViewPage is a Page Object  \n11:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: so I am allowed to remove it ? .. and re-imlpement it as a test ?  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr?  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ViewPage is a page Object  \n11:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i know  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it represents the common actions between all view pages  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the UI there' s a delete page  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why would you want to remove it?  \n11:51\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0I'm trying to make xwiki work as a portlet in liferay, the portlet is deployed correctly, but I have a problem during the first request with Hibernate  \n11:52\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0tons of org.hibernate.ObjectNotFoundException: No row with the given identifier exists: [com.xpn.xwiki.doc.XWikiDocument#482909206]  \n11:52\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0(mflorea ;) )  \n11:52\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: because I'm writing a test that uses the ui to delete a page. Like hover over page, click delete, then click yes on the confirmation  \n11:52\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0given that the log says that the mysql driver is loaded and that all the tables are found  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I don't understand your logic  \n11:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I am writing a \\_test\\_ to delete a page. My test would use the actual UI, like go there, click there, etc  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: tests MUST use Page objects to implement the tests  \n11:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i know  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so whatt's the pb?  \n11:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0in the ViewPage, we have methods like : clickCopy, clickDelete, which return a Page Object  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: your tests will call ViewPage.deletePage() (BTW I don't like the current in the method name, it's useless)  \n11:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I am writing a \\_test\\_ that simulates all the actions of that method, but within a test, so I can use the UI by the book  \n11:55\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: what's the recommended way to create a reference to a page in this wiki -- DocumentReference with only space and page filled in? Note that I want this to be a constant in my class, it's just a class name, and I would like it to refer to the current wiki.  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I don't get it  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: DR is always absolute. what you should do is use a current provider if you need to get the current wiki  \n11:56\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: check CopyPageTest.java. I am trying to do something analogically \\_exact\\_ for DeletePageTest  \n11:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0jstoldt: Are you here?  \n11:57\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0what does it mean a current provider?  \n11:57\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0resolver you mean?  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: starting project in IDE  \n11:57\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0as in I store it in serialized version \"space.page\" and then when i need to use it I resolve it with the current resolver?  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: see EntityReferenceValueProvider  \n11:58\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I want a private static final to hold it  \n11:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvdrean: can you access the wiki directly? I could do this with WebSphere  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: you can use a \"current\" component impl of it and then do a new DocumentRef(provider.getValue(\u2026), \"space\", \"page\")  \n11:58\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0mflorea: I can't  \n11:59\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0I mean not at the same time  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: the other option (which is less good IMO it's to use en Entity Reference Resolver to resolve a relative entity ref)  \n11:59\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0but I've tested the webapp successfuly in the same tomcat  \n11:59\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0(liferay uses tomcat)  \n11:59\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: wouldn't that fix my value to the value of the provider at the moment of class load?  \n11:59\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0same libs, same configuration, same everything  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: that's the point of absolute reference\u2026 they're aboslute  \n12:00\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: if I do  \n12:00\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0private static final ref = new DocumentRef(provider.getValue(\u2026), \"space\", \"page\");  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if what you need is a relative one then it's different  \n12:00\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok, then I cannot store it as DR  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in that case you store an EntityReference  \n12:00\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(I think I said I need a relative one in the first place)  \n12:01\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0DocumentRef is not an EntityRef?  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you didn't  \n12:01\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0or it is but is too much?  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DR is an ER  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but ER is not an DR  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and DR is a sepcial and \\*valid\\* ER  \n12:01\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well yes, I kinda know that, what I didn't know is how special is the DR  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0valid = it's a full valid reference which contains all parts specified  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/specified/needed/  \n12:02\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, I might as well store it as a string and resolve it with the current resolver I already have in my class  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can call it an absolute ref  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no string  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's an antiapttern that we'r fixing  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/an/the/  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it seems to be the easiest to understand solution at this point  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should never need to manipualte strings  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(well I \\_do\\_ exagerate a bit here, to prove my point from last night)  \n12:03\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ER it should be then  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing parsing everytime you need it is 1) costly in perf and 2) dangerous since you're postponing the validity to later  \n12:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I know we shouldn't use strings  \n12:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in this case it's very straightforward, because it's a constant  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the recommendation is to use absolute refs as a strong preference. There are valid use cases for using relative refernces though  \n12:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0validity comes into play only if I'm idiot  \n12:04\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0as a dev  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not really  \n12:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I write a piece of code that reads objects from a fixed xwiki class  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lots of things can happen  \n12:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0is that a good reason to use relative refs?  \n12:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0since I want the class in \\_this wiki\\_ not in the main wiki  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you read objects then you can get the object ref as a ref  \n12:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0what?  \n12:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0XWikiDocument.getXObjects(DocumentReference classRef)  \n12:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0am I using the wrong API?  \n12:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I need a doc ref for the class  \n12:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I want it relative  \n12:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0am I thinking wrong?  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know the api well but what I know is that XObject hold a ref to the document they belong to  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I'm pretty sure I added a getDocuemntReference() in there  \n12:07\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but I need to get the objs first, I'm not sure I understand  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm maybe I only added it for XClass  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what do you want to store?  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I don't want to store, I want to read  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the gadget objects in the current docujment  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I grabbed the document  \n12:09\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and now I need to getXObjects(gadget class)  \n12:10\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sdumitriu: back  \n12:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what is it you want?  \n12:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0gadget class has to be a DocumentReference, which I want to be relative to the current wiki  \n12:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0that's it  \n12:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0doesn't matter, i know how to do it  \n12:10\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in a way or another  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we don't have an api for that  \n12:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0bb in 30. vmassol, we'll continue then  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can only get an XObject using a DR I think let me check  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you need a DR  \n12:12\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and I'm fine with that  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is normal)  \n12:12\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I just need to be able to store it as a constant in my class  \n12:12\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and I cannot store it as a DR because I want it relative to the current wiki  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0store the gadget class ref?  \n12:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so, it's gonna be a  \n12:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0private static final EntityReference GADGET\\_CLASS =  \n12:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0new EntityReference(\"Gadget\", EntityType.DOCUMENT, new EntityReference(\"XWiki\", EntityType.SPACE));  \n12:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes, the gadget class ref  \n12:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0no?  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should store it as DR IMO  \n12:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and always point to the main wiki?  \n12:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0why?  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n12:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0because I think that's not gonna work  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is in a macro right?  \n12:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0to get me the objects  \n12:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes  \n12:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, not really in a macro, in a class called by the macro  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you'll need to add the wiki at exec time since the current wiki depends where the macro is executed  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so your code above is correct  \n12:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and I will need an currrentEntity resolver or some other fancy name it has to resolve it to a DR relative to current, at runtime  \n12:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0right?  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n12:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0no?  \n12:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0then?  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can just do:  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm yes you're right it's easier. I was going to say you should use the value provider  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but since you're saving an ER you can do this:  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0currentEntityRefernceResolver.resolve(GADGET\\_CLASS)  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0currentReferenceEntityReferenceResolver.resolve(GADGET\\_CLASS) to be precise  \n12:18\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0EntityReferenceResolver with hint current, right?  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"current/reference\"  \n12:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the resolver you're looking for  \n12:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0is there one with hint current?  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0takes an ER as input and outputs a DR  \n12:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yeah, I saw it now (I'm looking at class files)  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes there's one \"current\" == \"current/string\"  \n12:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0aha  \n12:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0takes a string as input  \n12:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but it won't fit my params  \n12:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok  \n12:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I see  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's why you should use \"current/reference\"  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually you should use: CurrentReferenceDocumentReferenceResolver  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since it outputs a DR)  \n12:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but, to continue what I was saying last night, this is what I find complicated: finding what resolver you need, understanding that there are 2 types (from string from ref) and 4 types for each: WikiRef, DocRef, SpaceRef, AttachRef (for each string and ref). Having class names made of 5 words of which 2 are the same doesn't help.  \n12:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I can understand it, in the end, and work with it, but when I don't have somebody to explain these diffs between all resolvers & stuff it's very very hard. This is what I tried to figure out last time I had trouble with this API  \n12:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(is this good feedback?)  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we need some doc?  \n12:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sure, doc can solve the problem partially  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I created some here in case you don't kniw it: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model+Module  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one thing I can say is that we made a wrong assumption with Thomas when we designed the Reference API. We initially thought we wouldn't need realtive references so we added that later on (actually we didn't need to add anything but it means we haven't put the notion of Absolute/Relative in class names)  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the good thing with the api is that it's very terse when you know which resolver to use  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a one liner to resolve anything to a valid reference  \n12:25\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have several classes because there are 2 apis  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one generic one using EntityReference  \n12:26\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0as a feedback, I didn't learn much from the link you just sent me. To be understood as: \"I knew what is there, and I still have troubles figuring it out\"  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and a typed one using DR,, AR, etc  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's not enough misingh things from it  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it does explain some stuff though  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's covering the basic use cases  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not the \"advanced\" ones  \n12:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the general model I understand, I kinda know how it's supposed to work, but I still can't figure out how I should use it. Maybe it's normal that it's a hard API, but as long as you need it to get objects from a doc, it can be problematic  \n12:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean when I look for stuff to use it, I still have troubles  \n12:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0we should write a wrapper for this, to cover very frequent cases or something  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw in your case the problem  \n12:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0what I fear is that everybody will need to come on the IRC if they want to read the objects in a document  \n12:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(I'm still thinking how to make it easy)  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that the rendering api is made to be used outside of XWiki and thus we've had to use Strings instead of Reference  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to think about this in order to see if there's a way to improve that for those using it inside XWiki  \n12:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ah yeah, that too  \n12:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0is a bit hard to deal with  \n12:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0you have strings, but for xwiki you cannot use them as string  \n12:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0s  \n12:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it  \n12:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it's a bit tough, and generates a looot of resolvers and serializers @Requirements  \n12:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(see the annotations classes :) )  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the rendering-api source doesn't mean anything  \n12:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0although that's a different case  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can put whatever format you wantin it  \n12:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I understand  \n12:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it just creates complexity  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we have a xwiki-rendering-xwiki module  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which has XWiki-related code  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can easily add some helper code there  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to return DR instead of a String  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for source for ex  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you'll still need to know that ;)  \n12:31\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well first, we need an API to return the source :)  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have that  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes what we need is an \u00a0api to return the closest source  \n12:31\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in a macro I mean  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in an XDOM tree  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure yet where to put that  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go now, recording episode of lescastcoderus, bb in 1 hour  \n12:32\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0my humble opinion is that we need to cover these most frequent cases, of writing a macro, or some other stuff that people might need, in some sort of wrapper  \n12:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0even if it's not really that much inline with our fancy very flexible almighty API  \n12:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it just makes things usable for normal people  \n12:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ttyl vmassol, have fun  \n12:33\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:51\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n12:54\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:00\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sdumitriu: ping  \n13:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Trying to fix the word issue  \n13:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Is it OK if I just break the word in the middle?  \n13:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0As in:  \n13:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Einladungsappli  \n13:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0kation  \n13:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think it will be fine. problem is that since you are doing it generic i reckon it won't obey grammar  \n13:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but it's still better than having the word be spread over the border  \n13:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0although in case of your example even the grammar is correct  \n13:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No, it's not real hyphenation, just word breaking at the margin  \n13:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what should be considered would be adding a hyphen  \n13:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i know, which is a sensible approach  \n13:12\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Unfortunately, browsers don't know that yet  \n13:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0indeed  \n13:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but i think that one would still be a long time off, anyway  \n13:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0you'd need more meta data in the produced code so it's interpreted correctly... and then, i don't think many web programmers would bother with it  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi: selenium joins the SFC: http://sfconservancy.org/  \n13:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Nice  \n13:21\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I am back. so IMO deleteCurrentPage() from ViewPage should be implemented as a \\_test\\_, NOT in a PageObject. If we need a method to delete a document, we can call getUtil().deletePage.
