So I hope that here is the right way to communicate.  \n10:45\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has quit  \n10:46\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok probably the .zip which would explain the annoying matter of having to convert attachments at the beginning  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you're using the zip distribution which has a set of default pages  \n10:46\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0unless one starts with the \"zip\" package, which is actually what a lot of people are doing ...  \n10:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0maybe we should build a .zip with FS attach enabled by default  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: no, I'd prefer that we make FS the default for attachments ;)  \n10:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0do one and then the other?  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if they're the defaujlt  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then the zip will have the atatchments on FS  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/they're/it's  \n10:49\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0For me I used the debian install dep and run the \"installation wizard\" which download the rest and configure the \"standard\" xwiki  \n10:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's possible, just jumping in immedietly without a sort of staging period could be a source of bugs  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Kaisen: cool but did you set up FS config before running the DW?  \n10:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0DW == \"installation wizard\"  \n10:50\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0No I run everthing and than I start configuring the xwiki.cfg  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then you didn't start with an empty wik  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the DW installed all the pages in the DB with attachments alors in DB  \n10:50\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Yes that what I tought and named it \"Virgin\" :)  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're doing a migration in practice  \n10:51\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0\u00a0I can imagine most people consider going though the distribution wizard as part of completing the installation \u00a0.... but then you got the logo as attachment at least of course ...  \n10:51\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Yes thats what I figured out. But if you changed the settings of the store and run than the script to port the script faild  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another option is to have a step before the DW to let users configure their wiki  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to let them choose a \u00a0few options  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DB connnection, FS attachments, etc  \n10:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that seems logical  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0an install wizard  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is triggered only once  \n10:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0then you could install a jetty package and point it to mysql  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and which comes before the Distribution Wizard  \n10:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0depending on how it worked  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-1761  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: but for that tomcat (or whatever) must have the right to modify xwiki.cfg/xwiki.properties/hibernate.cfg.xml  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is the main issue  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: sure, but that works  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do write in the permanent dir  \n10:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0otoh if someone's using tomcat then they're used to bugs :)  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not note xwiki.cfg  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/note//  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you mean there's a special security on tomcat by default for WEB-INF?  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case config files must go in the perm dir too  \n10:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0how do you know the perm dir if the configuration is in the perm dir ?  \n10:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0copy the conf file differences into perm dir?

I visit a subwiki, doesn't matter which one of them. in the URL, instead of wiki name, I put another name which does not exist. I get the content from the main wiki, but the URL stays the same. is this intended ?  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't do any redirect  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we just fallback to the main wiki  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(by default)  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: the whole point is to be sure you will access the main wiki if the URL does not match anything, if we do a redirect and the main wiki descriptor is wrong or does not exist (which is the default) we have no idea what URL to redirect to  \n15:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0understood. thanks  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: you tested https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/212/files ? I'm surprise + syntax work in #set actually but maybe it's working since 1.7 and I'm too used to the old version  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's my only comment, IMO it's acceptable so if you confirm me it's working for sure I'm going to apply it  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nvm I tested it myself and it indeed works  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you need a committer to close XWIKI-9729 or is there something else to do ?  \n15:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: I just pushed a PR concerning your last advice on github  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok, looking  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0applied  \n15:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0thx  \n15:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0So I think I can close the jira now  \n15:54\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, I tested it locally - did not run any integrtion tests or the like  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: ok  \n15:55\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0(sorry, been abducted by aliens for the usual experiments, but back now)  \n15:56\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0thanks for applying the patch!  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: that's to you for the patch ;)  \n15:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*thanks  \n16:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:17\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0uh, some tests failed on jenkins; I cannot really see which ones  \n16:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: I doubt it's related to your patch, we don't have any test on subwikis right now  \n16:45\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Hello, I have just a short question.
