 \n16:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i think i lost internet shortly during upgrade to 7.12  \n16:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0can i just refresh the page or will everything break ?  \n16:44\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0or even better, is there a timeout with a retry ?  \n16:44\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it's stuck on Resolving extension dependency [https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/bin/distribution/XWiki/Distribution?extensionId=org.xwiki.platform%3Axwiki-platform-attachment-ui&extensionVersion=7.1.2&extensionNamespace=wiki%3Axwiki&xback=%2Fxwiki%2Fbin%2Fdistribution%2FXWiki%2FDistribution%3Fxredirect%3D%2Fxwiki%2Fbin%2Fview%2FMain%2F] on namespace [https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/bin/view/Main/]  \n16:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0restarted tomcat, and now xwiki doesn't start again  \n16:57\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0and ideas?  \n17:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Trefex: have you tried to move away the \"jobs\" directory in the permanentDir ?  \n17:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0refresh page might have worked, it does on subwiki updates (I tried that), and I guess it should work with the main wiki too (but I have to admit I never tried that)  \n17:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if the server has most internet connection, then stopping the server, move away \"jobs\" dir and start again might be necessary (or even recover from backup, if it started updating pages already)  \n17:20\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: ah no i didn't do that yet!  \n17:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i'll give it a go  \n17:36\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: i think i got lucky, after being \"stuck\" after rebooting the server, like for 5 mins, the Wizard started again from scratch, and now it worked!  \n17:36\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0scary stuff...  \n17:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, so maybe it was hanging and waiting for the connection to come back  \n17:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0or it was just slow \"calculating\" the dependencies  \n17:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I got into the habit of building a \"dummy\" project depending \u00a0locally dependign on the XWiki verison I need and then syncing up my ~/.m2/repo - that makes all necessary dependencies available w/o connection  \n17:40\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: not sure what you just said but i will just nod :)  \n17:40\u00a0\\*\u00a0Trefex nodding  \n17:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: is there somehwere a full list of syntax supported?  \n17:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0eg on github i see stuf for HTML5, tex,etc...  \n17:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0on http://rendering.xwiki.org/  \n17:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0what does output syntax mean?  \n17:50\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR:  \n17:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that you can convert e.g. HTML in that syntax  \n17:50\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: ah ok, so basically, HTML 5 is available in 7.1.2?  \n17:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0something you might need e.g. to convert from XWiki to another wiki system  \n17:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, since 6.4 XWiki can generate HTML5, but it cannot really parse it as input in the WYSIWYG editor  \n17:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0we are bleeding edge, so no 6.whatever :D  \n17:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0which is not a problem for the end user, but if you write a script that downloads a HTML page and converts it into XWiki syntax ... it might no work if the web page is HTML5  \n17:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is why there is an (x) form HTML5 and input  \n17:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: i see, so even in 7.1 I can't type HTML5 in the editor ?  \n17:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but I have to admit I did not follow that HTML5 development closely  \n17:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, if you copy & paste some <date> elements or the like into the editor, the result is not well defined  \n17:54\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok then i will not enable it  \n17:54\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0as for the rest, the conversion has to be done on that rendering page or can be done in my wiki as well?  \n17:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but as the editor itself claims to be HTML4 it is the job of the browser to repair this (usually)  \n17:54\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0eg i want to migrate some mediawiki content to xwiki  \n17:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there is an importer application ... but you might need some bits of code instead  \n17:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Filter+Application \u00a0- but you migth try to catch tmortagne to get more details about how to use it ;)  \n17:56\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it that works \u00a0you need no extra code  \n17:56\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok i also can just copy paste, it's merely 10 pages o so  \n17:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, and no link repair necessary? then you can enable mediawiki syntax in the config, I think  \n17:57\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: don't think i need link repair  \n17:57\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: xwiki is so complex, but i think i start to like it :)  \n17:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0or just use the online converter on http://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome#HDemo  \n17:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yeah i was thiking of that  \n17:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0onver rom media wiki to xwiki/2.1 and paste the result in the source editor, might be best, as you can fin tun details  \n17:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0will increase the document store now to 1000  \n17:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0with 8 GB RAM, can I go higher?  \n17:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0modulo typos, sorry :(  \n17:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, you can, but I doubt it will help much  \n17:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0one document = 1 page?  \n17:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0since we use Markdown mostly, sometimes there's a slight delay to render the page  \n17:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0document store cache: at least 1000! \u00a0better 10000  \n17:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0or an Exception when trying to Save after editing...  \n17:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0this sounds more like a bug somwhere  \n17:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok, next time it happens, i will file one!  \n18:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it should not need gigabytes of ram to save a single page  \n18:00\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok so xwiki.store.cache.capacity=10000 ?  \n18:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you have a stacktrace that would be helpful, otherwise it might end up as \"not reproducible\"  \n18:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, the production systems I care about run with that value (an just 4GB RAM)  \n18:01\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: here are whole bunch of stacktraces :)  \n18:02\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://paste.ubuntu.com/12118958/  \n18:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, that looks like an error either in the parser or the markdown syntax. \u00a0do yu have a small smale documetn that reproduces? (because this should be reproducible)  \n18:04\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: mhhhh i think i fixed it in the meantime, let me check if i can reproduce  \n18:06\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: here is an example  \n18:06\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0https://paste.fedoraproject.org/256347/43991400/  \n18:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0In this case, the xwiki at lest didn't give a front-end exception (but sometimes happens too)  \n18:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0this page triggers the - Failed to get the default edit mode for [lcsbbiocore:lcsb-sysadmins.NCER-bitrix]  \n18:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0exception  \n18:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: note, if you add 1 new line at the end of that page, it will work  \n18:07\u00a0\\*\u00a0ClemensR needs to restart a test server with markdown ...   \n18:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, that sounds like a \"simple\" bug then  \n18:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0parser does not create the \"text is finished\" events properly, causing the internal representation to be confused  \n18:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0here I just got another problem, sorry, have to handle that firs  \n18:15\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: do i have to file it, or ?  \n18:15\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yesm, please file it, or it will get lost  \n18:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I am not an expert of the parser, and I feel I might not be able to fix it, jut help diagnosing it ;)  \n18:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: also, some unrelated question, but i'm still a little offset by the look of the renderer for code blocks  \n18:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has there been an issue for it ? I remember there has been, but I forgot here :-/  \n18:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: http://i.imgur.com/wYqo6Or.png  \n18:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: i think that it doesn't look right  \n18:18\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0mostly because the inline code blocks feel ever so slightly bigger than the surrounding text  \n18:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0bug reports for markdown syntax best go into the http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING \u00a0project, component \"markdown/1.1\"  \n18:21\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: also for the style?  \n18:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0style is code macro ... I guess that is a component in the \"XWIKI\" project, but \u00a0forgot  \n18:24\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0do you agree with me or am I just being weird? :)  \n18:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0mom, just smashed one preview server here and need to repair :(  \n18:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: filed the one bug with the exception  \n18:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i'll think about the styling tomorrow  \n18:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0gotta run  \n18:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:04\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:15\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:20\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:20\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:44\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n19:52\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:05\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:54\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:09\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:21\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:36\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n22:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:56\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:13\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n23:19\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit\n"}
