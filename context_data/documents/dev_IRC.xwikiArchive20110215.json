;)  \n10:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0wow, that is a pretty wild assumption :-P  \n10:10\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0opera is a good js validator, if the js is not standards complient, it will fail it.  \n10:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i have a feeling that most corporate users of XWiki will care a lot more about IE 6 and 7 than any version of FF  \n10:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, you said that a while back ;)  \n10:10\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0^yup and no thanks to ms for making vista so horrible that people would stick to a 10 year old os.  \n10:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0still, i think sticking to rules a little stricter is a good thing because otherwise you have to have thirteen different hacks for everything  \n10:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0very true  \n10:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but it's not only MS  \n10:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it's also the vendors  \n10:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i mean, Win 7 is being shipped with any lenovo thinkpad  \n10:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0putting aside those that are shipped to this company  \n10:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0those come with freaking XP because they are incapable of providing a Win 7 platform  \n10:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0let alone a x64 one  \n10:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yea, xml is a funny thing. browsers make their parsers more clever and website designers make their xml more broken.  \n10:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it's pathetic for all i care  \n10:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0kind of an arms race  \n10:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0exactly, so being too friendly as a browser vendor is making web programming shit  \n10:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It's intended for people to be able to browse the web, web designers use it and everything looks good so they ship.  \n10:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0even worse are vendors that block non-standard webbrowsers because they write their code for just one or two browsers  \n10:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that doesn't happen much AFAIK  \n10:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it happens on corporate level a lot, i figure  \n10:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0no way to access certain SAP generated webpages with opera  \n10:14\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0my email provider GMX won't give me full functionality because they are strict on that  \n10:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe  \n10:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think PTC Windchill will also only run on IE  \n10:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and if you just look at the lengths the XWiki dev team needs to go to have fairly similar views in all browsers... hacks and compromises everywhere because the browser implementations suck in so many cases  \n10:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ff + noscript + greasemonkey + adblock + user agent changer... pertty sure I could get that page to work.  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle, jstoldt: the page must pass XHTML validation: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdev.xwiki.org%2Fxwiki%2Fbin%2Fview%2FDrafts%2FSyntax%2BGuide%2BImprovements&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0  \n10:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, i did try that with opera and user agent faking  \n10:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but at least GMX won't work a hundred percent correct. i suppose it's because they adapted to crap code in IE ;)  \n10:19\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cjdelisle: your code... do you know what to do?  \n10:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Have to sneak that <style> tag into the head.  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: you sure that query string is not valid for mailto?  \n10:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh, my bad, now that you say it  \n10:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0go to the object editor and add a SSXExtension object and put the little hack in that.  \n10:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0will this work on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax#syntaxes then?

 \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(jstoldt)  \n14:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, i specified XWiki Syntax in all places  \n14:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because the guide is about XWiki Syntax  \n14:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but if you want to change it feel free to do so  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, it's true for other syntaxes too, like confluence, etc  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another question  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Link that opens in a new window  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure window is correct  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex on my machine it doesn't open in a new window  \n14:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i know, sometimes it opens tabs  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n14:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0BUT i changed it  \n14:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because this is what it says in WYSIWYG editor  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but maybe it's the wysiwyg editor that is wrong  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think windows is more correct than page  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0window not windows ;)  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(windows is never correct)  \n14:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hold on a minute, need to talkt to a colleague for a minute  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok never mind  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm keeping your version  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0patch applied, issue closed! thanks a lot, great patch  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you want to remove the draft page?  \n14:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0just a minute please  \n14:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, you can delete the draft  \n14:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0as for window vs. page, since the default for IE is window  \n14:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and imo a majority of users use IE and due to historichal evidence (meaning there were times without tabs) i think windows is better for understanding from a users POV  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re the draft do you want to keep it to add the xwiki syntax 2.1 link and image specs?  \n14:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh right, good point  \n14:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0keep it then  \n14:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0my bad ;)  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however  \n14:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yes?  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be best to copy its content from the committed version  \n14:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0definately  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since I changed 2 places slightly)  \n14:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sure thing  \n14:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm i think having an internee who is not working on his own very well can actually be a little annoying... ;)  \n14:29\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n14:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0guys, I just committed a first implementation of XWIKI-5939 and XWIKI-5941 (in edit inline mode).

 \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which was to use the HTML macro to write: <a href=\"$xwiki.getURL(?)\">whatever</a>  \n15:40\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correct , if no type is specified  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it looks for a url  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if not found  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0falls back to a page reference  \n15:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, so it's really just an enhancement  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a shortcut yes  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the canonical form  \n15:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cool  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is now always with a type specified  \n15:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0this is going to be what the WYSIWYG editor would create?  \n15:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0(in the future)  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm probably  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'd need to talk about this with mflorea  \n15:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because, imo, url: and doc: seem a little overkill to me given that the old one works just fine  \n15:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0or do you want it to be able to remove [[ ]]?  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no we'll keep [[ ]]  \n15:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like doc:wiki:space.name <-- tada link  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here's a use case:  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0try to create a link to a document in a wiki named \"doc\"  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or in a wiki named mailto  \n15:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ahhh  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a need for a strong spec to remove ambiguity  \n15:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, i get you there  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so while we allow shortcuts there are cases shortcuts can't be used  \n15:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0right. but it should really be optional, otherwise writing xwiki syntax on your own would be an utter pain ;)  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's why we added support for the shorthand form ;)  \n15:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0;)  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(especially since people are used to it)  \n15:46\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the good part here  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that with xwiki synatx 2.1 adding new reference type is possible  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's now extensible  \n15:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cool thing  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so for example you could imagein adding:  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0blog:title of the blog post  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[[blog:title of the blog post here]]  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or anything that comes to your mind ;)  \n15:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0nice stuff, indeed  \n15:48\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, i'll see if i can do this tomorrow. does not seem like a lot of work  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n15:49\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but i'll still have some other stuff on my list... only another 7 days of work left for me  \n15:49\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and still no real server available  \n15:49\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0gotta love IBM  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ooops  \n15:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yep... takes more than 3 months here to just get a freaking virtual instance in the server farm  \n15:50\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0alright. cu  \n15:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n15:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I can't find any documentation for the XWiki 2.1 syntax, is there any?

I have this scenario: the office viewer caches the XDOM created from the office presentation for performance reasons. Whenever you view an office presentation the office viewer checks if there is a cached XDOM and if so it returns it. Next this XDOM is rendered. The XDOM contains a macro block, the gallery, which upon execution import some JS/CSS resources using the SkinExtension component. My problem is that the XDOM is cached  \n19:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0long message :)  \n19:12\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the root problem is that the resource import is not visible in the content so if you cache the content you loose the resource import  \n19:15\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:18\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:33\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n19:58\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:58\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:12\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:34\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah attcj   \n20:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops  \n20:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: any idea if XWIKI-3366 is still an issue?  \n20:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(come on jira)  \n20:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-3366  \n21:00\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0FYI xwiki.org will be down for 5 minutes in a couple of minutes, for a maintenance operation  \n21:14\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0starting now  \n21:35\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok restore done on extensions wiki  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys if you can help checking all looks ok that would be great  \n21:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: checking code  \n21:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: no reason  \n21:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Then it can be added  \n21:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could add one if you think it(s useful  \n21:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I do  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems we have an import bug  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can someone confirm it's wrong  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I imported a page and I checked \"take history from import\" and \"backup\" pack  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it created a new revision  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with me as author  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that normal?  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems I need to delete the last revision to find myself in the same state as before  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which looks strange to me  \n21:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n21:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: I think that's a known resolved bug, but I'm not sure  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0resolved after 3.0M1 then  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're on 2.6+  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so resolved after 2.6?  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll try locally  \n21:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with a trunk version  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: indeed you're right  \n21:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it stills add a new revision is that normal?  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the user is the last author)  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this looks wrong  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since if you look at history it says the wrong user has performed an import  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there shouldn't be a new rev added  \n21:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when backup pack is selected  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we agree it's a bug?  \n21:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n21:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok creating jira  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe one day we'll get a working import feature?. :)  \n22:20\u00a0<SvenDowideit\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:23\u00a0<DrLou\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:25\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n22:25\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n22:25\u00a0<DrLou\\_>\u00a0is now known as <DrLou>  \n22:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:24\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:36\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n}}}\n"}
