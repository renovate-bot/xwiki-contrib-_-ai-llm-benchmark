 \nbaurjan - (05:16): if I want to make a whole new template or skin for xwiki, from what should i start?  \ncjdelisle - (05:16): How much different does it need to be from the regular type?  \ncjdelisle - (05:17): Are you just changing a couple things, or a whole new look?  \nbaurjan - (05:17): background color, background images  \nbaurjan - (05:17): and some layout  \ncjdelisle - (05:18): Are you using the .exe file, the .zip file or the .war file for your wiki?  \nbaurjan - (05:18): exe  \ncjdelisle - (05:19): That should have installed the wiki somewhere on your hard disk, there should be a webapps folder somewhere.  \nbaurjan - (05:19): yup  \nbaurjan - (05:19): i know where it is  \ncjdelisle - (05:20): In that folder you should fine webapps\\xwiki\\templates  \nbaurjan - (05:20): ok  \ncjdelisle - (05:20): Inside of the templates folder is all of the layout templates which defines the interface.  \nbaurjan - (05:21): ok  \nbaurjan - (05:21): one more question  \ncjdelisle - (05:21): When you are at yourwiki.com/bin/view/Some/Page, you are looking at the view.vm template.  \nbaurjan - (05:21): when i create a blog news, there is a date attached to the blog  \ncjdelisle - (05:21): /bin/view/ \u00a0--> view.vm \u00a0\u00a0/bin/edit/ \u00a0\u00a0--> edit.vm \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0make sense?  \nbaurjan - (05:22): how can I change the view of that date  \nbaurjan - (05:22): yup  \ncjdelisle - (05:22): The blog is an application inside of the wiki (it's Documents in the database)  \nbaurjan - (05:23): when I open the source code of the html page, i can see the css class caled blogDay  \nbaurjan - (05:23): day  \nbaurjan - (05:23): i tried to find that css class  \nbaurjan - (05:23): file  \nbaurjan - (05:23): but could not succeed  \ncjdelisle - (05:24): Where exactly was it getting the .css file from?  \nbaurjan - (05:24): just a minute  \ncjdelisle - (05:25): I don't know the specifics about the Blog application but to find what you're looking for, when you are at the page which shows the date, You want to add ?viewer=code to that page and start following the code until you find where the date is displayed.  \nbaurjan - (05:25): <div class=\"blogDay\"> <h2 class=\"blogdate\"><span class=\"month\">???</span> <span class=\"day\">01</span> <span class=\"year\">2009</span> </h2>  \ncjdelisle - (05:25): Is your problem that the date is incorrect?  \nbaurjan - (05:26): no  \nbaurjan - (05:26): i just want to change how it is displayed  \nbaurjan - (05:26): the view of the date  \ncjdelisle - (05:27): Since the blog application is inside of the database, the css file you are looking for is inside of the database as well.  \nbaurjan - (05:27): hmm ok  \ncjdelisle - (05:28): One fix which comes to mind is to search for all documents in the /Blog/ space which have stylesheet objects attached.  \nbaurjan - (05:29): so there is no way i can change the file that is in database  \ncjdelisle - (05:29): Oh you can easily change it once you find it ;)  \ncjdelisle - (05:29): And your changes will have all the benefits of the XWiki versioning system.  \ncjdelisle - (05:30): (If you don't like them, just roll them back.)  \ncjdelisle - (05:30): You could create a new document and put in:  \ncjdelisle - (05:30): {{velocity}}  \nbaurjan - (05:31): what is velocity?  \ncjdelisle - (05:31): it's a programming (scripting) language.  \nbaurjan - (05:31): i c  \ncjdelisle - (05:32): #set($docsNames = $xwiki.searchDocuments(\", BaseObject as obj where doc.fullName = obj.name and obj.className = 'XWiki.StyleSheetExtension' and doc.space='Blog'\"))  \ncjdelisle - (05:33): #foreach($name in $docsNames)  \ncjdelisle - (05:33): \u00a0\u00a0[[$name]]  \ncjdelisle - (05:33): #end  \ncjdelisle - (05:33): {{/velocity}}  \ncjdelisle - (05:33): ^^ try putting that into an empty document.  \ncjdelisle - (05:34): excluding this part: ``<baurjan> what is velocity? <cjdelisle> it's a programming (scripting) language. <baurjan> i c''  \ncjdelisle - (05:34): that's off the top of my head, I don't have my wiki engine running, it probably has a little mistake somewhere.  \nbaurjan - (05:35): what it is goin to give me?  \ncjdelisle - (05:35): If it works, a list of document links to any document in the Blog space which has a css object.  \nbaurjan - (05:35): cool  \nbaurjan - (05:35): i'll try it now  \nbaurjan - (05:36): but where should i put that code?  \ncjdelisle - (05:36): just create a new document anywhere and paste that as the content of the document.  \ncjdelisle - (05:36): document, meaning an XWikiDocument inside of the wiki engine...  \nbaurjan - (05:37): how do i create a document, you mean a new space or page?  \ncjdelisle - (05:37): yes, a new page.  \ncjdelisle - (05:38): hehe internally they're called documents, I forget that the user interface calls it a page.  \nbaurjan - (05:41): ok, i opened a sandbox test1  \nbaurjan - (05:41): opened wysiwyg  \nbaurjan - (05:41): i mean edit in wysiwyg  \ncjdelisle - (05:41): err nope, you want wiki editor, not wysiwyg.  \nbaurjan - (05:41): and put code in it  \ncjdelisle - (05:41): sorry for the confusion.  \nbaurjan - (05:43): but where should i put that code  \nbaurjan - (05:43): ?  \ncjdelisle - (05:44): Edit in wiki mode then just paste it right into the page as the content.  \nbaurjan - (05:46): ok, the code returned me a ManageBlog Categories  \nbaurjan - (05:46): :)  \ncjdelisle - (05:47): How many pages did it output?  \ncjdelisle - (05:47): err how many links I should say.  \nbaurjan - (05:47): just one  \ncjdelisle - (05:48): Well then I guess we know where the css you want is.  \nbaurjan - (05:48): ManageCategories  \nbaurjan - (05:48): where?  \ncjdelisle - (05:48): Just click on that link and see if there's an edit button in the corner of the ManageCategories page.  \nbaurjan - (05:49): yup, it it there  \ncjdelisle - (05:49): Are you set as an \"advanced user\" so you see the different ways to edit a page?  \nbaurjan - (05:50): yup  \nbaurjan - (05:50): superAdmin  \ncjdelisle - (05:50): Ok, just hold the mouse over the edut button and you should see a dropdown menu.  \ncjdelisle - (05:50): Select \"Objects\" in that menu.  \nbaurjan - (05:50): ok  \nbaurjan - (05:50): ok  \ncjdelisle - (05:51): Do you see a \"StyleSheetClass\" object in the menu which shows up?  \nbaurjan - (05:51): yes  \ncjdelisle - (05:52): Click on that to expand it and you should see a text area with the css you are looking for.  \nbaurjan - (05:53): ok got it, but thisi is only for managing blog categories  \nbaurjan - (05:53): i just need to find the one that is for blogs themselvs  \ncjdelisle - (05:54): Af you do a search (ctrl+F) do you find \"blogDay\" in that css?  \ncjdelisle - (05:54): I  \nbaurjan - (05:54): no  \nbaurjan - (05:54): it is a small file  \ncjdelisle - (05:54): Hmm.  \nvenkatesh left at 05:54 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \ncjdelisle - (05:56): If you do a regular find-containing on the filesystem /webapps/ folder does anything contain \"blogDay\"?

 \nbaurjan - (06:06): it is just a css class whish is defined in a cs file  \ncjdelisle - (06:06): it should be inside of a file.  \ncjdelisle - (06:07): find ./ -name 'css' -exec grep 'blogDay' {} \\; -print  \ncjdelisle - (06:07): user@debo8:~/wrk/xwiki$ find ./ -name 'xml' -exec grep 'blogDay' {} \\; -print  \ncjdelisle - (06:07): nothing.  \ncjdelisle - (06:07): I guess it's just not defined anywhere.  \nbaurjan - (06:07): well, i am using wndows  \ncjdelisle - (06:07): So you can define it anywhere you like.  \nbaurjan - (06:07): not a mac or linux  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 06:07  \ncjdelisle - (06:07): Since it's java, it's the same code.  \ncjdelisle - (06:08): So what you can do is define blogDay in any css file you like and use it.  \ncjdelisle - (06:08): What I recommend is you add your own css extensions in a document.  \ncjdelisle - (06:08): err page ;)  \ncjdelisle - (06:09): So just create a page somewhere out of the way, Code.Page or something and in that page, add a StyleSheetExtension.  \ncjdelisle - (06:09): If I recall, there's an option to make that style sheet extension be used all of the time.  \ncjdelisle - (06:10): So with that and the !important css command you should be able to override anything you want to.  \nbaurjan left at 06:14 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nbaurjan joined #xwiki at 06:40  \nDenis left at 07:01 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nDenis joined #xwiki at 07:08  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 07:14  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 07:45  \nsburjan` joined #xwiki at 08:00  \nasrfel joined #xwiki at 08:22  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 08:55  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 08:57  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:05  \nrrodriguez left at 09:11 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nsilviar left at 09:15 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:19  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 09:19  \nfmancinelli left at 09:21 (Client Quit  \nevalica joined #xwiki at 09:29  \nsburjan - (09:36): evalica: can you tell me again what to test ?

(22:15): Hi Daemoen  \nsdumitriu - (22:15): What's up?  \nDaemoen - (22:15): not much just discovered xwiki last night while trying to find an alternative for jira  \nDaemoen - (22:15): bah, confluence  \nDaemoen - (22:15): after looking at wikimatrix, im amazed people still buy confluence, technically xwiki has more features =D  \nsdumitriu - (22:16): Well, XWiki is the right alternative  \nDaemoen - (22:16): \\* nods \\* \u00a0i am curious about the webdav support, has it matured, most of the documentation seems a bit stale on the website  \nDaemoen - (22:16): going back to the 1.7 build  \nDaemoen - (22:17): and at the time, it only supported basic auth, etc  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): Nothing changed there  \nDaemoen - (22:17): \\* nods \\*  \nsdumitriu - (22:18): There aren't many alternatives  \nDaemoen - (22:18): now if only there was an xwiki alternative to jira that integrated with it like jira and confluence itegrate  \nsdumitriu - (22:18): Digest is not feasible, since it requires storing the password in cleartext, which is not good practice at all  \nsdumitriu - (22:18): Yes, I'm planning on writing one, but I lack the time at the moment  \nsdumitriu - (22:19): It is possible to integrate XWiki and Jira somewhat  \nDaemoen - (22:19): so youre the original developer, right ?  \nsdumitriu - (22:19): For example:  \nsdumitriu - (22:19): XWIKI-123  \nsdumitriu - (22:19): No, I'm not  \nsdumitriu - (22:20): I just happened to be around after an IRC split and be alone enough to register the channel  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 22:20  \nDaemoen - (22:20): ahh  \nDaemoen - (22:21): i was debating if i was going to do the evil and learn ruby so that i could mess with ruby and mediawiki, but found xwiki and it supports python scripts, which can be great for dynamically generating information by polling a DB  \nDaemoen - (22:21): was thrilled to discover python support built in  \nsdumitriu - (22:21): There's also groovy built-in, and ruby and php as optional extensions  \nDaemoen - (22:22): nods  \nflaviusolaru left at 22:51 (Ping timeout: 250 seconds  \nDenis left at 23:12 (Quit: Leaving.  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 23:32  \n\n"}
