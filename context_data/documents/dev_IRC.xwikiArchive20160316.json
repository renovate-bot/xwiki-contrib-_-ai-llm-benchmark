I've tried `image:foobar.png` (comes out literal) & `[[image:foobar.png]]` (links to create a child page). I'm about to try installing the Radeox macro and going about it that way. Any advice?  \n15:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0is \u00a0![altText](foobar.png) \u00a0not working? that should be the markdown way (I thought)  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nooooo don't use the radeox macro, that's very old and deprecated! :)  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes images are supported AFAIK  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in markdown syntax)  \n16:00\u00a0<mrvis>\u00a0no mention of images in github/pegdown or xwiki/markdown11  \n16:01\u00a0<mrvis>\u00a0will try ClemensR  \n16:03\u00a0<mrvis>\u00a0ClemensR++ - no \"image:\" required.
