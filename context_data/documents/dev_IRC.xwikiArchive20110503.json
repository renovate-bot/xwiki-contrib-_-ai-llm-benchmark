It ran a test once but it should not test anymore either unless someone commits to the M1 branch which is rather silly at this point.  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it got triggered earlier today  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it was you who did that manually?  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can we remove it from hudson?  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/hudson/jenkins/  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll need to clean it up from our remote repo too at some point since I'm not sure it'll get removed  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we need to check our nexus rules)  \n13:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Or at least disable it.
