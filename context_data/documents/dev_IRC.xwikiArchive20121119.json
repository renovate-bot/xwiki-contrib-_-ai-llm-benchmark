I'll check it out  \n09:13\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0there should also be a way for me to \"always wrap code macros in cache macros\" but I am not sure where to start. Can I call a friend? Ask the audience?  \n09:17\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Will rendering cache be invalidated when a page is edited?  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Inge-: \"always wrap code macros in cache macros\", for this you could create your own wiki macro that does it  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's 3 lines of scripts)  \n09:17\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I've heard flying is easy - for those who know how :)  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a tutorial  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0!search wiki macro  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no there  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WikiMacroTutorial  \n09:18\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0google is my friend  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n09:18\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n09:18\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could open a jira issue to add support for caching directly in the code macro (not sure it would be accepted but it's a valid request). Or ask on the mailing list  \n09:19\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0thanks. Googling for xwiki macro tutorial came up with this one: http://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ExtendingMacro  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I also googled)  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(googled for \"xwiki wiki macro\")  \n09:19\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0google is scary good. usually faster than site-specific searches, and often more relevant.  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah  \n09:20\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I use it all the time in preference to the search bar in Microsoft's MSDN site :)  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your use case is valid and I think code macros should be cached by default  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you should create a jira issue for it  \n09:21\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Yeah, you guys did discuss it in here some weeks back.  \n09:30\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:32\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0vmassol: I'm a little worried I'll put it in the wrong place. This is my first ever jira bug report :). Issue Type I guess is improvement, priority minor. What about Project? Xwiki rendering? XWiki platform?  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02 seconds, checking  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes that's the issue when implementing it ;)  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's rendering  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0component = code macro  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0type and severity are ok  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the issue when implementing it is that the cache module is currently in platform)  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but we can handle that)  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(cache module should be in commons IMO)  \n09:38\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0vmassol, Have you checked https://project.snowberry.me/programs/projects/xwikiobjectsort ?  \n09:40\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0vmassol: thanks.
