Just a second while I read it.  \nxwiki-bridge - (02:43): [Cindy Mitchell] kk  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:43): What command do you use to include the menu bar?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:44): I assume you are using velocity code to try to get hold of the bar to include it, correct?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (02:50): I am also doing other things, if you want to get my attention say \"Caleb\" in your post and I get a popup.  \nxwiki-bridge - (02:56): [Cindy Mitchell] #template(\"colbiri/global.vm\") or somesuch.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:01): [Cindy Mitchell] I think it's because I don't know how to import stuff from my base template.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:02): Were you calling this template from inside of a document?  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:03): [Cindy Mitchell] From inside view.vm or whatever.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:03): [Cindy Mitchell] Have you ever seen like how blogger does it?  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:03): [Cindy Mitchell] with their menubar above the main website?  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:04): [Cindy Mitchell] That's kind of how I want it.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:06): [Cindy Mitchell] Ah,'  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:06): [Cindy Mitchell] okay.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:06): [Cindy Mitchell] Caleb- yes.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:07): [Cindy Mitchell] I want the default \"user bar\" above my design.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:07): [Cindy Mitchell] that gives you your whatever it gives you, lol.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:07): Yes? I'm still trying to figure out exactly what you want.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:08): Depending on what it is, there is a good chance it can be done in CSS.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:08): Let me look at a blogger page. Just a second.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:09): [Cindy Mitchell] Okay.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:09): [Cindy Mitchell] Er, blogspot.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:10): Is this what the viewers of the blog see or only what the editor sees?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:12): I see a menu bar at the top of http://googleblog.blogspot.com/ which is like the top menu bar in xwiki except that it doesn't stay on the top of the browser window when you scroll down.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:13): [Cindy Mitchell] Yeah, I want the \"User bar\" in xwiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:14): [Cindy Mitchell] but I want it to be \"above\" my theme.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:14): [Cindy Mitchell] if that makes any sense.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:14): [Cindy Mitchell] but I want  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:14): [Cindy Mitchell] [xwiki \"user bar\"]  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:14): [Cindy Mitchell] [rest of the theme]  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:16): Are you using the version of xwiki where the bar is fixed to the top of the browser window or the version where it moves with the page but some of it is down below?  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:16): [Cindy Mitchell] Ask Lady Serena Kitty what version we're using.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:16): [Cindy Mitchell] She maintains it.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:17): [Cindy Mitchell] but basically, I've got this theme I'm porting to xwiki- http://www.r-butler.net/~robert\\_/template/Pinnacle/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:18): So you want the top menu bar to be below the logo and login link?  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:20): [Cindy Mitchell] Yeah. And then everything else sits below the top menu bar.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:21): It looks like you want to move <div id=\"menuview\"> and everything inside of it (until the closing </div>) underneath <div id=\"headerglobal\" class=\"layoutsection\">  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:23): [Cindy Mitchell] So how would I \"add\" that using velocity?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:25): Open up startpage.vm and move #template(\"header.vm\") up by 3 lines so it is just above <div id=\"menuview\">  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:27): [Cindy Mitchell] OH  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:27): [Cindy Mitchell] menuview and header.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:27): [Cindy Mitchell] Okay.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:27): [Cindy Mitchell] I got'cha.  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:28): [Cindy Mitchell] wait, that's all the menubar is? \u00a0just menuview.vm and header.vm from Colibri  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:28): [Cindy Mitchell] ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (03:30): The menu bar is menuview.vm and the logo/login info is header.vm  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:31): [Cindy Mitchell] Ah.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl left at 03:57 (  \nsunny\\_slls joined #xwiki at 05:45  \nsunny\\_slls left at 05:55 (\"Konversation terminated!\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (08:36): [Lady Serena Kitty] I detect a shortcoming of XWiki's LDAP integration.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:13): \\*\\*\\* Lady Serena Kitty has an idea  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:31): [Cindy Mitchell] hm?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:31): [Lady Serena Kitty] it seems XWiki only pulls information from LDAP  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Lady Serena Kitty] seems it doesn't push anything TO the directory  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Lady Serena Kitty] which is what we need  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Cindy Mitchell] indeed.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Cindy Mitchell] Ah.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Cindy Mitchell] So if I'd make changes to Halberd's users  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Cindy Mitchell] they wouldn't stick as of now.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:32): [Lady Serena Kitty] aye, they'd only be inside XWiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [Cindy Mitchell] Yeah, that's not very useful.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:34): [Cindy Mitchell] oh by the way  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:34): \\*\\*\\* Cindy Mitchell brings Jessica some food.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:34): \\*\\*\\* Lady Serena Kitty noms  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:34): [Cindy Mitchell] :3  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:34): [Cindy Mitchell] hey, it's what sisters are for, yes? :3  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:34): [Lady Serena Kitty] yar  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:34): [Cindy Mitchell] \\o/  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:35): [Cindy Mitchell] so hm  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:35): [Lady Serena Kitty] but I have an idea  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:35): [Cindy Mitchell] Yey!  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Lady Serena Kitty] create a new LDAP class for XWiki that syncs upward  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Cindy Mitchell] Oooh. That'd be nice.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Cindy Mitchell] so down-sync and up-sync.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Lady Serena Kitty] since the one in XWiki already syncs downward, just reverse the flow  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Cindy Mitchell] yeah.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Lady Serena Kitty] well, up-sync only, since XWiki is our master app  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Cindy Mitchell] yeah.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Cindy Mitchell] oh  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Cindy Mitchell] then we need svn tools and stuff inside the wiki software.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Lady Serena Kitty] already thought of that \u00a0:D  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Cindy Mitchell] :D  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Cindy Mitchell] this is going to get \\*very\\* interesting.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:38): [Lady Serena Kitty] I'm going to build an SVN browser inside XWiki, while SVN actions will be handled directly by the SVN server  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:38): [Cindy Mitchell] squee.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:39): [Cindy Mitchell] so we'll indeed be a mini sourceforge.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:39): [Lady Serena Kitty] run Apache+SVN on a back-end, and have nginx forward all requests: location /svn/ { proxy\\_pass http://10.25.1.4; }  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:39): [Cindy Mitchell] \\o/  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:39): [Cindy Mitchell] sweet.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:39): [Cindy Mitchell] so hm  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [Cindy Mitchell] you and I need to look at how freshmeat lists project info  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [Cindy Mitchell] because I like their layout style <.<  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Lady Serena Kitty] but I'm not sure if we can have it host-sensitive like XWiki is, or if we can config SVN to treat /svn/\\*/ as separate projects  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Cindy Mitchell] well  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Cindy Mitchell] we'll need an svn admin utility that writes nginx config  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Lady Serena Kitty] in other words, we won't just be a forge, we'll be a forge farm  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Cindy Mitchell] yup.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [Lady Serena Kitty] why would it need to write nginx config?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [Cindy Mitchell] projects.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [Lady Serena Kitty] mew?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [Cindy Mitchell] whenever you create/delete a project  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [Lady Serena Kitty] wouldn't that be handled by the svn server?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [Cindy Mitchell] how will svn know the project exists (or doesn't exist anymore)?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:43): [Cindy Mitchell] we could split each of the projects off as separate svn repos.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:43): [Lady Serena Kitty] yar  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:43): [Cindy Mitchell] which means each will need their own separate svn config, etc.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:43): [Cindy Mitchell] meaning nginx will need to know about them.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:43): [Lady Serena Kitty] so create/delete repos based on hostname+folder  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [Cindy Mitchell] yeah  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [Lady Serena Kitty] not if nginx is just blindly passing requests along like it does for XWiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Cindy Mitchell] we might need an svn farm then, to handle requests like that.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Lady Serena Kitty] ya  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Lady Serena Kitty] and hopefully that can be done on one server  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:46): [Cindy Mitchell] because one way or another, there'll need to be either another copy of nginx or something that passes requests like that over to svn for proper handling.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Cindy Mitchell] we could repurpose our current system for a project server.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Cindy Mitchell] (with the new hardware and all.)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Lady Serena Kitty] WHY would there need to be another copy of nginx?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Lady Serena Kitty] SVN is all HTTP-based, thus, it can blindly pass requests along to the SVN backend  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:48): [Cindy Mitchell] svn isn't a stand-alone http server, ya know.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:48): [Lady Serena Kitty] o.O  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Cindy Mitchell] it's http-based when something like mod\\_svn is used.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Cindy Mitchell] which means you'll need to set it all up inside the webserver config.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Lady Serena Kitty] ya, back-end apache  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Cindy Mitchell] nginx is different?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:50): [Lady Serena Kitty] nginx is a performance web server  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:50): [Lady Serena Kitty] supports proxying and caching for HTTP, IMAP, POP3, and SMTP  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:51): [Cindy Mitchell] I meant is svn config in nginx different from svn config in apache?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:51): [Lady Serena Kitty] and can serve static content for HTTP  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:51): [Cindy Mitchell] sorry, I should have been more to the point. :3  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:52): [Cindy Mitchell] XD  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:52): [Cindy Mitchell] 'Blahg'  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:52): [Cindy Mitchell] Oh  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:52): [Cindy Mitchell] okay.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:53): [Cindy Mitchell] then you'll run mod\\_svn+apache2 for the svn stuff?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:53): [Lady Serena Kitty] ya  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:53): [Cindy Mitchell] okay, then it'll need to read/write apache2 config  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:53): [Lady Serena Kitty] unless I can find a servlet implementation of SVN  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:55): [NielsMayer] i'm not sure that approach is neccessary. svn is a subset of dav which is well supported in xwiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:55): [NielsMayer] http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.webdav.autoversioning.html  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:55): [Lady Serena Kitty] hmm  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:55): [Cindy Mitchell] interesting.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:56): [Cindy Mitchell] so we could in theory get svn clients to work with xwiki directly?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:56): [Lady Serena Kitty] that'd be sweet  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:56): [Cindy Mitchell] it would be.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:56): [NielsMayer] i've been playing with davfs2. now i mount xwiki as a filesystem: mount -t davfs http://xwiki/xwiki/webdav /mnt/davxwiki/  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:56): [Cindy Mitchell] so  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:57): [NielsMayer] the real issue independent of svn  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:57): [NielsMayer] is that xwiki's dav view of things exports docs as both a wiki.txt and wiki.xml  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:57): [Lady Serena Kitty] ya, I've mounted XWiki on my machine, too  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:57): [NielsMayer] the wiki.xml contains objects xmlencoded  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:58): [NielsMayer] and nobody will want to work with that, we want to work with \\*.js for JSX's \\*.css for SSX's etc  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:59): [Cindy Mitchell] so, is there an xwiki davfs server that works with svn clients?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:59): [NielsMayer] and when checked in via svn those, e.g. JSX-0, JSX-1 ...N and SSX0-N would need to be packaged up into an xml doc and then unpackaged again on xwiki's side  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:59): [NielsMayer] which is pretty lame  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:59): [Cindy Mitchell] hm  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:59): [NielsMayer] really what's needed is to have the dav view \"explode\" documents into their constituent objects as files  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:59): [NielsMayer] of correct tupe  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:59): [NielsMayer] type  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:00): [Cindy Mitchell] heh  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:01): [NielsMayer] thus a dav or ssh view of XWiki.Admin would be XWiki/Admin/{wiki.txt,obj.ext,obj.ext...}  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:01): [NielsMayer] rather than XWiki/Admin/{wiki.txt,wiki.xml}  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:02): [Cindy Mitchell] so, if the dav view could do that, we could interface directly with svn clients?  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:02): [NielsMayer] then the same dav/svn view would \"do the right thing\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:02): [NielsMayer] \u00a0yes alongside the Kfogel suggested hack, i believe it would  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:02): [NielsMayer] ie. \"autoversioning\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:03): [NielsMayer] which just checks in a new rev for each save, just like xwiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:03): [Cindy Mitchell] sweet.  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:03): [Cindy Mitchell] Well, Jessica- it looks like we can ditch mod\\_svn  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:03): [NielsMayer] i sent an email to the list a while back suggesting it  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:03): [Cindy Mitchell] (with some tweaks)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:03): [Lady Serena Kitty] ya  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:04): [NielsMayer] what exactly are you trying to do... i saw the comment about building your own sourceforge  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:04): [Lady Serena Kitty] we're on a joint venture to build a forge-farm  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:04): [NielsMayer] i was one of the first pair of engineers on sourcecast project at collabnet that bought sourceforge  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:04): [Lady Serena Kitty] the difficult part is all in SVN integration  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:04): [Cindy Mitchell] for a joint OS project.  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:05): [NielsMayer] i generated all the use cases for svn and was part of hiring team for karl fogel  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:05): [NielsMayer] he rescued my cat as part of his interview  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:05): [Cindy Mitchell] heh  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:05): [Lady Serena Kitty] aww  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:05): [Cindy Mitchell] how cute.  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:06): [NielsMayer] there's no way i would climb three stories for my cat  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:06): [Cindy Mitchell] Holy..  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:06): [NielsMayer] but he was tired of the meowling and the fire department was taking its time  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:06): [Cindy Mitchell] heh  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Cindy Mitchell] Jessica~  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Lady Serena Kitty] mew?  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Cindy Mitchell] I woke up thismorning with this fucking huge gash on my left calf D:  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Lady Serena Kitty] O.o  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Cindy Mitchell] well, morning/afternoon  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Cindy Mitchell] it's like something tried to gnaw on my leg o.0  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Lady Serena Kitty] D:  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Cindy Mitchell] indeed. u.u  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Lady Serena Kitty] its late and I sleepy kitty  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:07): [Cindy Mitchell] awww.  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:08): \\*\\*\\* Cindy Mitchell lets Jessica sleep in her room. :3  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:09): [Lady Serena Kitty] so, I'll get to work on that LDAP auth class for XWiki tomorrow morning  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:09): [Cindy Mitchell] alrighty.  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:09): [Cindy Mitchell] nighty night, sis :3  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:09): [NielsMayer] i talk about this alot http://markmail.org/message/66zwo3wq3d46a7ev  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:09): [Cindy Mitchell] I see.  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:10): [Lady Serena Kitty] ya, XWiki could definitely do it  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:10): [Cindy Mitchell] Niels, you can PM me if you want, and I'll explain as best I can (in my state) what all we're planning on doing  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:11): [Lady Serena Kitty] and I might need to pick someone's brain about some details of an LDAP class for XWiki that does upward syncing  \nLadySerena joined #xwiki at 10:12  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:12): \\*\\*\\* Cindy Mitchell throws confetti across the void to Jessica :3  \nCalebJamesDeLisl joined #xwiki at 14:05  \nlucaa1 joined #xwiki at 14:06  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:13): I'm working on updating the Scripting howto to reflect the addition of Python and the Php and Ruby macros.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:13): I was planning on mentioning the xcontext.getContext() trick for gaining access to the raw core but say it's not a good idea when it can be avoided.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:14): Sound good?  \nlucaa1 left at 16:42 (\"Leaving.\"  \nsunny\\_slls joined #xwiki at 17:36  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:40): Hi sunny.  \nsunny\\_slls - (17:41): hi CalebJamesDeLisl   \nsunny\\_slls - (17:41): sorry busy with campus recruitment stuff  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:41): [sdumitriu] Hi sunny\\_slls  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:41): Not ready to try installing?  \nsunny\\_slls - (17:42): yup i am ready  \nsunny\\_slls - (17:42): can you give me a min CalebJamesDeLisl   \nsunny\\_slls - (17:42): i will be back  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:42): [sdumitriu] Btw Caleb, I don't quite agree with your installation tips  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:43): How would you advise?  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:43): [sdumitriu] I agree that it would be nice to be able to install using the .war, but you have to be gentle with young students  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:44): [sdumitriu] Some of our own people don't know how to install XWiki using the war  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:44): I never tried anything but the war :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:44): [sdumitriu] The zip is nice and easy  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:45): Do you think you can help? I don't know much about it.  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:45): [sdumitriu] You can have XWiki running in 5 seconds after the zip is downloaded and unzipped  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:45): [sdumitriu] Download, unzip, run start\\_xwiki.sh  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:45): [sdumitriu] That's all  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:45): I just hate to give advice which I never did myself.  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:45): [sdumitriu] Yep, that's a good strategy  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:46): I guess that's easy enough, still will you be able to help if he gets in trouble?  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:46): [sdumitriu] Sure  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:46): Great.  \nsunny\\_slls - (17:46): xwiki-bridge, as i told CalebJamesDeLisl that i would go for war since i wan't to go for user interface first and then core part  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:47): [sdumitriu] Since sunny\\_slls seems to be more interested in the light part of XWiki (clientside development), getting to know the details about the core is not essential  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:47): [sdumitriu] If you want to go for the .war, that's good  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:48): Installing the war is more of a server administration type thing. It's good practice but I agree it can be overwhelming.  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:48): [sdumitriu] You'll get to learn more about how Java webapps work  \nsunny\\_slls - (17:48): xwiki-bridge,so what do you suggest me to do  \nsunny\\_slls - (17:48): ??  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:49): It's a question of what you want to learn, do you intend to run a public server?  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:49): [sdumitriu] Call me sdumitriu, xwiki-bridge is just a bot forwarding messages from IRC to Jabber and back  \nsunny\\_slls - (17:49): ok  \nsunny\\_slls - (17:50): literally i would like to start with the user interface part  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:51): Sorry I jumped in, I think this is your question Sergiu.  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:52): [sdumitriu] Caleb, don't worry  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:53): [sdumitriu] sunny\\_slls: You can just download the zip archive from http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Download  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:53): [sdumitriu] Or even the .jar one  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:54): [sdumitriu] The zip one is simpler  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:54): [sdumitriu] So this file: http://forge.objectweb.org/project/download.php?group\\_id=170&file\\_id=14173  \nxwiki-bridge - (17:54): [sdumitriu] Download it to a local folder, under the current user.

Presto.. Re-start-o!  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:59): [Lady Serena Kitty] I've always viewed wiki software as a simpler alternative to CMS.  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:59): [Lady Serena Kitty] but XWiki also has a lot of features from typical CMS  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:00): [Vincent Massol] rebooting, brb  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:03): [Cindy Mitchell] it does.  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:03): [Cindy Mitchell] which is nice.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:04): I first realized XWiki was superior technology when I found out Wikipedia has over 700 bots editing pages.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:04): That can all be done with scripting.  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:06): hey CalebJamesDeLisl, here it is given to develop a faq application using velocity  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:06): [Lady Serena Kitty] yea, with XWiki scripting, all those automated updates can be done within the server  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:06): [Lady Serena Kitty] and that can save tons of transfer  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:06): CalebJamesDeLisl, but i don't have any idea about velocity  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:07): Sunny, here is some info about scripting http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting (Which I am working on :) )  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:08): CalebJamesDeLisl, so i need to work on scripting to work on faq application  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:08): It links to the velocity user guide http://velocity.apache.org/engine/releases/velocity-1.6.2/user-guide.html which will help you learn the syntax.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:08): I don't remember if the FAQ application uses scripting.  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:09): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/FAQTutorial  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:09): here it is   \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:09): Yes, that's velocity. You'd better read the user manual.  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:09): ok  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:10): CalebJamesDeLisl, is there anything else i need to know other than velocity  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:10): ?  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:11): you also mentioned groovy  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:11): You can do (almost) everything with velocity, but there are other scripting languages.  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:12): ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:12): [sdumitriu] Velocity is really small, it's just a bridge to a Java API  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:12): [sdumitriu] So you'll have to learn the XWiki scripting API  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:13): [sdumitriu] Velocity itself is very easy to learn: #set \u00a0#if #else #end \u00a0#foreach #end \u00a0and \u00a0#macro  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:13): ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:14): [sdumitriu] But you have $xwiki, $context, $doc, $request, $response, which is where the real action takes place  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:14): $xcontext :)  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:15): xwiki-bridge, these terms looks familiar like javascript  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:15): [sdumitriu] Yep, $xcontext is the new way  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:16): ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:16): $xcontext is supported in syntax1.0 it is just not available in Groovy syntax 1.0  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:16): CalebJamesDeLisl, that jumped over my head :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:16): It's explained here http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:17): ok let me go through velocity first  \nA-Kaser left at 19:17 (\"\"Soyons r\u00e9alistes, exigeons l'impossible.\" Ch\u00e9 Guevara\"  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:17): then i will move on to xwiki scripting API  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:18): [sdumitriu] http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/DevGuide/API/xwiki-core-2.1.1-javadoc.jar/index.html  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:19): [sdumitriu] It's quite big, so it's better to learn it by example, and as you need it  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:19): [sdumitriu] Just take a glance first to see what's available  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:20): xwiki-bridge, let me cover velocity first  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:21): xwiki-bridge, or is it better to go for the xwiki scripting \u00a0API?  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:21): [Vincent Massol] learning basic velocity will take you 10 minutes  \nsunny\\_slls - (19:22): ok then  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:24): Vincent: Have you figured out whether Python is bundled or should I download the war and check?  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:25): [Vincent Massol] Caleb: indeed it's bundled but I believe that's wrong  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:25): [sdumitriu] I think Python is bundled because the syntax highlighting uses it  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:25): [Vincent Massol] ah yes right  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:25): [Vincent Massol] I had forgotten this  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:25): [Vincent Massol] that's the reason indeed  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:26): I thought I remember Thomas compiled Pygments down to Java.

 \nxwiki-bridge - (20:47): [sdumitriu] Velocity should run on the wiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:47): [sdumitriu] You don't have to do anything other than put the code inside {{velocity}}  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:48): [sdumitriu] pastebin what you wrote  \nsunny\\_slls - (20:48): http://pastebin.com/m3d23a02  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:49): [sdumitriu] You are already inside a wiki page  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:49): [sdumitriu] You don't have to write full HTML  \nsunny\\_slls - (20:49): then  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] Just write:  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu]   \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] {{velocity}}  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] #set( $s = \"Google I Love you\" )  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] hello $s  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] {{/velocity}}  \nsunny\\_slls - (20:50): ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] {{velocity}}  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] #foreach($i in [1..10])  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] \\* List item $i  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] #end  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:50): [sdumitriu] {{/velocity}}  \nsunny\\_slls - (20:51): done  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:51): [Lady Serena Kitty] okay, I think I have this figured out  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:52): [sdumitriu] If you want to use HTML, you must wrap the code inside {{html}}...{{/html}}  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [Lady Serena Kitty] to create my own LDAP implementation for upstream syncing, I need to re-implement com.xpn.xwiki.plugins.ldap.\\* and com.xpn.xwiki.user.impl.LDAP.\\*  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [Lady Serena Kitty] correct?  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [Vincent Massol] you'd need to ask thomas I think, he's the LDAP master  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [Lady Serena Kitty] ahs  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [Lady Serena Kitty] but he's not here \u00a0:(  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [Vincent Massol] he'll be here tomorrow  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [Lady Serena Kitty] okay  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:53): [Vincent Massol] (I think)  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:54): [Lady Serena Kitty] if I sent him an email today, do you think I'd get a response today?  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:56): [Vincent Massol] possibly, you can always send a mail on the list, he'll respond when he's avail  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:56): [Lady Serena Kitty] :D  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:56): [Vincent Massol] (don't send mail directly to him, always to the list though)  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:56): [Lady Serena Kitty] well ya, so other devs can see the conversation :D  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:57): [Vincent Massol] among other reasons yes :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:57): [Lady Serena Kitty] besides, his email might be personal, and I'm a client  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:57): [Vincent Massol] right  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:57): [Lady Serena Kitty] this question should go on the devs mailing list?  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:58): [Vincent Massol] hmm\u2026 either would do I think  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:58): [Lady Serena Kitty] I'm going to use devs, because this is a question about XWiki internals.  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:58): [Vincent Massol] I think devs is about xwiki dev itself  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:58): [Vincent Massol] but it's ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [Lady Serena Kitty] worst thing that can happen is I'm told to post to users@  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [Vincent Massol] sure  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [Vincent Massol] nobody will say that I'm sure  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:59): [Vincent Massol] ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:15): [Lady Serena Kitty] well I sent my message, not sure about the list's turnaround time  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:19): [sdumitriu] It's there already  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:19): [Lady Serena Kitty] ahs  \nCalebJamesDeLisl left at 21:24 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)  \nsunny\\_slls - (21:25): goodnight everybody  \nsunny\\_slls left at 21:25 (\"Leaving\"  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 21:47  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 21:47  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:02): [Vincent Massol] who!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl joined #xwiki at 22:27  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:30): [Lady Serena Kitty] now to add an admin user for XWiki itself in my LDAP  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:33): My break lasted longer than I expected, network fell over.  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:35): [Vincent Massol] mine lasted less longer than I expected\u2026 snow leopard installed without a problem :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:37): [Cindy Mitchell] hooray!  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:38): \\*\\*\\* Cindy Mitchell patpats Caleb  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:38): [Cindy Mitchell] :P  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:38): [Cindy Mitchell] Jessica, how goes ApacheDS?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:41): I was thinking about the Action interface. Are we talking about having one action call another or talking about the url specifying how actions should be chained?  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:42): [Vincent Massol] one action call another  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:42): I read about aspect oriented programming (on wikipedia) I didn't see anything about before, after, or insteadOf.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:42): So forgive me if I'm not thinking about this right.  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:43): [Vincent Massol] http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/adk15notebook/ataspectj-pcadvice.html  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:43): [Lady Serena Kitty] I'm using OpenDS  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:54): I was thinking maybe the ActionManager could call the Action with the Response object passed as a parameter, then the Action could call another action with a newly created response object. When that action returns, the first action can analyze the response object it created and use that to create the real response.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:54): Does this seem like what you were thinking?  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:57): [Vincent Massol] as I said the use cases need to be defined first. I haven't thought about this for a while so the design still has to be done. But one important point is that actions must not be aware of each other  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:59): I agree about actions not being aware of each other (or at least aware of which action they are interacting with)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:59): The first use case I can think of is a gzip action which takes the output from another action and gzips it if the browser supports.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:00): And maybe a cache action which works the same  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:00): .  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:00): [Vincent Massol] we need a design page to list them all  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:00): [Vincent Massol] another is the ability to add a new action by a user  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:01): [Vincent Massol] (since xwiki is a webapp framework)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:01): Add a new action? like in groovy?  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:01): [Vincent Massol] (abilility to add a new action dynamically)  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:01): [Vincent Massol] either dynamically or through a jar you drop in web-inf/lib yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:02): [Vincent Massol] note that this UC is already implemented in xwiki-actions AFAIR  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:02): I imagine the view action consulting the configuration to see what actions should be called before and after.  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:03): [Vincent Massol] either that or having priorities in actions  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:03): [Vincent Massol] it wouldn't be the view action consulting anything IMO  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:03): [Vincent Massol] but the action manager handling this  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:03): [Vincent Massol] the view action shouldn't be aware of this  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:04): [Vincent Massol] nor any other action  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:04): [Vincent Massol] it's a generic mechanism  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:04): [Vincent Massol] it's the state machine that should know about this  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:04): I see.  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:05): [Vincent Massol] the decision of which action to call can be as complex as needed  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:05): [Vincent Massol] for ex, such action could be called if the user is not logged in but such other if the user is logged in  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:05): [Vincent Massol] such actions could be called if the user is an admin, etc  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:05): [Vincent Massol] so you need a part that decides which action to call based on a context  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:06): [Vincent Massol] (the controller in MVC language)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:06): So all of the logic sits at the action manager level.  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:06): [Vincent Massol] well the logic should probably be modifiable too  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:07): [Vincent Massol] injectable  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:07): [Vincent Massol] not monolithic  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:07): It becomes apparent that individual actions cannot be grabbing the response object from the container when their response needs further postprocessing.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:08): It almost sounds like it should go to a velocity template to decide which action(s) to call.  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:09): [Vincent Massol] using velocity or another scruipting language is just a facility  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:09): [Vincent Massol] the api needs to be thought in pure java first IMO  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:10): Agreed.  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:10): [Vincent Massol] then it's always possible to add a special implementation for scripting  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:10): [Vincent Massol] bbiab  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:10): See ya.  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:21): \\*\\*\\* Lady Serena Kitty is not understanding how to set up user rights in LDAP  \n\n"}
