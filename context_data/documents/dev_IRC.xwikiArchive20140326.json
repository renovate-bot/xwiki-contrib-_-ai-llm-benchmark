Is the HQL query of a database list property velocity-interpreted?  \n09:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think normally it is not interpreted, it depends on how you output the values  \n09:54\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0what I mean, is if \\*before\\* executing the query, velocity is run on the query string in order to expand variables  \n09:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, yes, it should, if it is not single quited or the like  \n09:57\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ok thanks  \n10:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ie.e. #set($query = \"... here some text with $vars ...\") \u00a0\u00a0$services.query.hql($query) \u00a0... etc pp  \n10:02\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:02\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n10:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n10:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n10:04\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:05\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ClemensR: I was talking about the HQL query specified in a class database list property definition :) Anyway it works...

Plus we're going to evaluate the integration of an external editor, like ckeditor, so I don't think it's worth spending time on this issue.  \n10:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's interesting to check though if other editors like ckeditor has this issue, i.e. if other editor have a custom link insertion code and don't rely on the default browser command  \n10:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, I opened it to document the fact that it happens :)  \n10:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but it's very interesting  \n11:00\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:32\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n11:35\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:43\u00a0<sbaloul2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:09\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<sacha\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:19\u00a0<sacha\\_>\u00a0Hey guys, I have a Xwiki auth issue - can't login in XWiki (using an OAuth patch), I'm getting an infinite redirect loop. anybody got that already?  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(xwiki.org is crashing a lot)  \n12:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n12:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:24\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:30\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n13:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: would be nice if you could review and finish http://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki60M1#HTestedBrowsers26Databases  \n13:46\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I will later, because now I'm testing migrations on 5.4.3  \n13:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:57\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:57\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0yep.
