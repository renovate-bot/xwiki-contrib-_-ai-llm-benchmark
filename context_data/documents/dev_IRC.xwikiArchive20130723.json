 \n16:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:49\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0ok i'll check the \"Observation\" stuff, sounds like that'll do it  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tekzilla: yup  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AttachmentAddedEvent, etc  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we might be missing AttachmentAddingEvent though if you wish to do something before it's added  \n16:56\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0vmassol: great, thanks! knowing when it has been added is all i want  \n17:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: is it OK to call it \"AutoCompletion Application\" when it's actually an extension to the \"Syntax Highlighting Application\" and not an application by itself?  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see it as a different app because auto completion is not related to syntax coloring  \n17:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\"AutoCompletion API\" is OK because it makes sense by itself  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to separate them more and this is what I'm working on too  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we should be able to install the autocomplete app without the syntax coloring app IMO  \n17:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that should not be hard to do  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n17:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok then, if that is the plan  \n17:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0on a similar note, we`re handling things a bit the wrong way when it comes to syntax highlighting... we`re feeding the whole document content to the autocomplete backend instead of feeding a language for which to get the completions and the content in that language only  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but you need logic to find the language  \n17:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when it comes to s/syntax highlighting/autocompletion  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or are you talking about something different?  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0really?  \n17:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it's the currently active mode  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bcause we do complex stuff on the server to find that  \n17:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0AFAIK, we can easily get the current mode under the cursor  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(TargetContentLocator)  \n17:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and, if it's a multiplexing mode (like \"xwiki\" is), we can get the innerMode  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check DefaultTargetContentLocator  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and see if you can have that on the client side  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to implement 2 things tomorrow:  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- support chained methods  \n17:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thinking more about it... I guess that, for a diferent client of the REST resource, it would be hard to get the language  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- have auto completion for links: [[label>>  \n17:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0did you notice the TODO I have added on http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Syntax+Highlighting+Application ?  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no I didn't thanks for pointing it out  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I saw the other ones but not this one  \n17:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I think the most important would be nested macros support  \n17:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since you can have html inside velocity or the other way around  \n17:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I remember that for security reasons we have introduced a limitation  \n17:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but can`t remember what was it exactly  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nested script macros  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we disallow that  \n17:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0is html a script macro?  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why don't we already support nested macros?  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm need to test that  \n17:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0in the codemirror implementation?  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope, server side impl  \n17:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0security issue AFAIK  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0everything is passed to server side  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no no  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I meant in the autocompletion  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\" ?
