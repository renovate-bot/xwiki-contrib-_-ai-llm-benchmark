I get a bit lost on ci.xwiki.org ?  \n09:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0just a sec  \n09:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/2859/testReport/  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: I will take care of it, XHTML validator does not like to much having duplicated ids on some subpages  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's normal since there is duplicated content between 2.0 and 2.1 at least  \n09:44\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, and I /thought/ I fixed that :-/  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0either we find a way to fix those id related error or we exclude those pages from validation  \n09:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but excluding these require to refactor a bit the validator  \n09:45\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, its these example headlines ... I must have done something stupid when trying to run the tests so I did not notice them  \n09:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so if you have an idea to fix those validations issue without a hack be my guest ;)  \n09:46\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0but these headlines also have been present in the previous version ... why did this not fail there ?  \n09:46\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, maybe because it has been only one table for all examples ....  \n09:47\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there was only one result  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now the is several results  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(in each section)  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: just sent an email  \n09:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can strip it but more places will arise where we need to do this and we're starting to do the stripping in a lot of places  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to decide if we really want to do that  \n09:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm fine with dropping support for jsessionid (no cookies)  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you guys can answer quickly then I can decide how to fix it and fix it quickly  \n09:52\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0maybe it would be easier to implement XRENDERING-20 \u00a0instead of wrestling the webstandard tests into not noticing some violations  \n09:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: the id is not generated by the toc macro  \n09:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you always have an id with a heading  \n09:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's generated by xwiki/2.x syntax parser itself  \n09:54\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, yes, this test checks the generated html, of course, so it would not help to scrap the syntax there  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0only thing I can think of is having difference example for each syntax  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that a difference id is generated  \n09:55\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, mayeb that would be the simplest fix  \n09:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but then there is consistency  \n09:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I guess it's minor enough as difference between syntaxes to be ok  \n09:57\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0actually what does XWiki do if it has two identical headlines in one document? I guess it adds numbers to make the id unique ?  \n09:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:58\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0anyway, yes, slightly modifying the headlines in the examples is maybe just the simples solution  \n09:59\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0sorry for not finding it beforehand, I remember I locally modified the test runs to only check the XWiki.XWikiSyntax page to make them \"run faster\" (otherwise would not even have finished over night on my small box at home ...), so I missed that glitch  \n10:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: nop XWiki does not do anything right now, or we would not have the validation failures ;)  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: are you here?  \n10:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll go ahead and hope sdumitriu agrees  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: now I wonder if I should remove the places where I added the stripping or not ;)  \n10:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we could leave them as safeguards or remove them for cleanliness since they shouldn't be needed)  \n10:14\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0are the debian packaging files stored anywhere ? :)  \n10:21\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n10:21\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:22\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n10:22\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:22\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n10:24\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0tmortagne: I see there are even more failures in some other subpages ( e.g. XWikiSyntaxTables), :-/ I will try to rewrite them; but if not, maybe the tests can just exclude them ? (I guess the WCAG tests already exclude the main syntax page the hard way, anyway)  \n10:25\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:31\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0Anyone got a answer to that ?  \n10:31\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0Looking to package up a java app and wanna use xwiki bits as a base possibly  \n10:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you might find something usable on maven.xwiki.org  \n10:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's where content is posted to by the build bot and during release  \n10:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/  \n10:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0somewhere in there :)  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ekarlso: they are deployed as maven artifact, search \"debian\" in the link provided by cjd  \n10:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the debian repository is \"generated\" by scanning the maven repository in a cron  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: FTR it's called a path parameter: http://doriantaylor.com/policy/http-url-path-parameter-syntax  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0spec: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was remembering it because I handled it in the new URL modue  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0modue  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0module  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\* Extract segments between \"/\" characters in the passed path.
