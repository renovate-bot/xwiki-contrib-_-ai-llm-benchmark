(02/12/2008 08:52): heay there  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:10): hi asyd   \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:10): asiri: one question for you  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:10): re the office importer  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:11): do you have a clean class named something like OpenOfficeHTMLCleaner that can be used externally by code?  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:11): in the future I think we'll also need a MicrosoftOfficeHTMLCleaner class  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:12): (that will be needed when importing HTML generated by MSOffice)  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:12): (some users will have Word and will want to do copy/paste)  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:13): (and we should allow them to copypast in the wysiwyg editor for ex and use the office importer code to clean it)  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:13): other question: do you have a clean OfficeImporterSource interface for the input source?  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:14): vmassol: HTML cleaner is not currently part of office importer, i simply use htmlCleaner = (HTMLCleaner) componentManager.lookup(HTMLCleaner.ROLE); clean the html generated by openoffice and apply few filters ... that are openoffice specific ..  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:15): vmassol: The source document is simply a byte[] ... but i beleive you meant something else ...  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:15): is it ?  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:15): asiri: I don't think this is true  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:15): you're doing a lot of cleaning  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:15): yes, through filters ..  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:15): it doesn't matter what technology you use  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:16): you're doing HTML cleaning  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:16): ok,  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:16): may be we should create a sub package for openoffice specific ones ?  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:16): or .. ?  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:16): so do you have a class that I can use from somewhere else to clean my HTML?  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:16): I want to do this:  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:17): cleaner = lookup(OpenOfficeHTMLCleaner.ROLE)  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:17): cleaner.clean(myhmlt)  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:17): No.  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:17): but it's possible to create one ..  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:17): I think it would be very useful to have  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:17): and much cleaner ;)  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:17): yes, i agree :)  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:17): and in the future we would add MicrosoftOfficeHTMLCleaner  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:17): so i can put all of those filters together and create a one ..  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:17): with a clean interface ..  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:18): yes same as the HTMLCleaner  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:18): got it ..  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:18): (please use the same interface)  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:18): yes, i agree ..  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:18): so it owuld be:  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:18): lookup(HTMLCleaner.ROLE, \"openoffice\")  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:18): lookup(HTMLCleaner.ROLE, \"microsoft\")  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:19): s/microsoft/microsoftoffice/  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:19): so this should go into xwiki-core-xml module ..  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:19): no I think it's fine in the office importer module  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:19): two more cleaners ..  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:19): aha ..  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:19): i see  \nvmassol - (02/12/2008 09:19): since it's about office import  \nasiri - (02/12/2008 09:20): yes.  \nxwikibot - (02/12/2008 09:44): Drafts.XWikiWebDAV was modified by xwiki:XWiki.asiri -
