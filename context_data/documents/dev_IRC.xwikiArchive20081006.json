But to do this I need some assistance :)  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 11:05): fmancinelli: sure, what do you need?  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 11:08): Well, basically I need to setup the building environment on the continuos building machine (i.e., putting there the Eclipse SDK) because the XEclipse build needs it, and I think that that would be enough. But I don't think I have access to the machine and I don't know how it is organized.  \njvdrean - (06/10/2008 11:08): the machine is maven.xwiki.org  \njvdrean - (06/10/2008 11:08): you're likely to have an access on it  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 11:10): I think you are right... I think I had actually... but I need to find my ssh keys in a backup :) Wait  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 11:16): ok. found it. I am in. Now my problem is how (and where) to lay things out  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 11:23): So first question: where can I unpack the needed eclipse SDKs? (proposal: an eclipse subdirectory in the home should be fine)  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 11:30): xipe: any idea on this?   \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 11:30): fmancinelli: I don't know about the layout, the best person to answer is Raffaello I think  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 11:30): he's here under the xipe nick but he doesn't answer often here so you might want to ping him on skype  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:30): is the default username and password different in XE ?  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 11:30): ok  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:31): cause Admin/admin does not work   \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:34): hmmm  \nasyd - (06/10/2008 11:42): \\\\_o<  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 11:48): cypromis: you need to have an Admin user in the wiki   \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:50): I imported the standard whatsitcalled into my enterprise manager installation  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:50): and now I try ot login and it does not accept the default one  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:50): when I install Xwiki its ine  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:50): with enterprise manager it seems the default user is different  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:50): or do I have to register an Admin user and that one will be Admin ?  \nasyd - (06/10/2008 11:51): once you uploader the xar, you need to click on it, select all data, and then import.  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:52): did that  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:52): its not my first install  \nasyd - (06/10/2008 11:52): and you can't logon using \"Admin / admin\" ?  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:52): just the first of enterpise administrator  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 11:52): correct  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 12:01): cypromis: it just works fine Whenever people tells us about this pb it's when they didn't import the Admin user page  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 12:01): cypromis: unless you made changes to authentication of course  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 12:01): (like configure LDAP only)  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 12:02): oh you're talking about XEM? (you said XE above)  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 12:02): in any case XEM should be similar  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 12:03): since it's XE + 2 plugins/applications  \nvmassol - (06/10/2008 12:03): XEM = XEM administrator I suspect  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 12:06): cypromis: yes, XEM or XE it should be exactly the same, if you can't login as Admin then there is no Admin user or as vmassol suggested you are not using the \"standard\" authentication  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 12:06): what error do you get when you try to login ?  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 12:16): lemme check  \nxwikibot - (06/10/2008 12:19): XWiki.AbdelkaderBenabdi was modified by XWiki.AbdelkaderBenabdi (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/AbdelkaderBenabdi  \nxwikibot - (06/10/2008 12:20): XWiki.AbdelkaderBenabdi was modified by XWiki.AbdelkaderBenabdi (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/AbdelkaderBenabdi  \nxwikibot - (06/10/2008 12:21): XWiki.XWikiCommittersGroup was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvelociter (Added object) - http://nearbee.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiCommittersGroup  \nxwikibot - (06/10/2008 12:21): XWiki.XWikiCommittersGroup was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvelociter - http://nearbee.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiCommittersGroup  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 12:22): ok, the ldap stuff was borked  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 12:23): sorry  \ncypromis - (06/10/2008 12:23): :)  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 14:35): I am back... sorry for the delay but I had some leakage problems (water :( )  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 14:37): anyway, I talked to Raffaello and I installed all the necessary SDKs... Now I should take care of handling the actual build. Raf told me that's in the hudson's domain  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 14:42): I suppose that the code is automatically checked out (somewhere) and the build scripts are run against it every time a commit is done. Now I don't know how all of this is configured, so I need a hint about how to proceed.  \nxwikibot - (06/10/2008 15:15): Design.RatingsImplementation was modified by xwiki:XWiki.GuillaumeLerouge - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/RatingsImplementation  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 15:15): fmancinelli: if I remember well all projects on our hudson are always built in an infinite loop commit or not  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 15:16): jvdrean could say more about that  \njvdrean - (06/10/2008 15:17): thomasmortagne: the problem of the infinite loop is partly in our project arch  \njvdrean - (06/10/2008 15:18): fmancinelli: yep you can configure hudson to update sources every \\* minutes and run a build if there has been some commits  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 15:18): thomasmortagne: thanks thomas, my question is where are the sources checked out and where do I put the script for building XEclipse. Actually for building it I have to issue 5 maven install command with some command line parameters (1 is for the plugin, 4 are for the standalone version, one for each architecture)  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 15:21): I think you have to choose the svn url the commend line to build when you create a new job  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 15:22): you can look at existing job configuration  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 15:23): or maybe you don't have rights ?  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 15:23): for example : http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform-applications-trunk/configure  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 15:24): you can link it to a svn repository url and uson will checkout each time it rebuild  \nthomasmortagne - (06/10/2008 15:25): in your case i think you will have to create 5 job unless these 5 projects are in the same tree  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 15:27): I don't think I have the rights to do this  \njvdrean - (06/10/2008 15:44): fmancinelli: you should have them now  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 15:44): ok I see the panel  \nxwikibot - (06/10/2008 15:52): DevGuide.velocityHqlExamples was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvdrean - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/velocityHqlExamples  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 15:55): This is the layout and what I have to do to build http://www.pastie.org/285904 In hudson I see that there is a link to the root pom (that I don't have). \u00a0So maybe I should try to craft a root pom (though I don't know if it's possible to say in that pom to build 5 times the same thing with a different profile each time)  \nxwikibot - (06/10/2008 16:04): DevGuide.velocityHqlExamples was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvdrean - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/velocityHqlExamples  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 16:55): I read something about hudson and I think that a good solution is to choose \"Build a free-style software project\" and provide a build.sh script that will simply execute my 5 maven build commands one after another. WDYT?  \nfmancinelli - (06/10/2008 17:12): going home... see you later  \nxwikibot - (06/10/2008 18:46): XWiki.nhards was modified by XWiki.nhards (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/nhards  \n\n"}
