I've installed 7.1.1 with the xwiki .deb packages on Debian + Tomcat 8 + openjdk7. no farm, just a single wiki. The theme/skin is flamingo. The proble we are seeing is in the wen UI: The drop down menus don't show after a click and the left side bar icons/glyphs for 'Blog', 'Dashboad', etc. show garbage inesetad that indicate the character is missing (FontASwesome afaik)  \n20:16\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0the browser dev console shows a bunch of CORS errors  \n20:16\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0...related to webjars and the fontawesome webfont. I've been reading and trying to make some sense of XWIKI-12250, XWIKI-12251, XWIKI-12271 and XWIKI-12246  \n20:17\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0and even tried usign the \u00a0xwiki-platform-cors-7.1.1.jar as suggested in the last commet of the latter  \n20:17\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0All to no avail  \n20:17\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0Anyone seeing something similar?  \n20:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0cramm: have you tried to clear your cache? anyway \u2026 I don't think anyone is available at this hour. Sorry I can't help.  \n21:09\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0evalica: Hi, thanks for replying. What I've tried is to uninstall xwiki completely, drop the mysql database and starting anew  \n21:10\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0evalica: as I write this I'm realising perhaps there is a cache in tomcat I need to clean too? I'm a total n00b in java et al  \n21:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I was talking more about your browser's cache  \n21:11\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0since you said you have problems with the menus and the icons.  \n21:35\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n22:10\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:38\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:03\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n23:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:24\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0evalica: will try that next  \n23:24\u00a0<cramm>\u00a0Thanks!  \n23:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0cramm: maybe this helps http://www.refreshyourcache.com/  \n23:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0cramm: but it might be a bug that needs reporting  \n23:48\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
