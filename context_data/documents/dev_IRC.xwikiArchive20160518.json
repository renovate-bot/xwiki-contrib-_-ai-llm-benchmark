http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-escaping/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-escaping/2464/ \u00a0because of \u00a0XWIKI-13269  \n10:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but I have no idea why, the code has not have escaped the < and > before, and it should not have done it as it returns JSON instead of HTML  \n10:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the only change is that it now uses jsontool, and shows the results on a single line instead of several ones  \n11:00\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n11:11\u00a0<ujjwal\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki

\n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*admin  \n16:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reminder to self: fix this null....  \n17:25\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has quit  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0M-yflory: question for you  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see you created http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Realtime+Netflux+Backend/  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I also see you put the following in there \"You probably don't want to install this directly\"  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so my question is: why have you created this page? ;)  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we only need to have pages that user want to install directly  \n17:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't think he's connected atm  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he is  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I checked before asking ;))  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's the main issue with vector.im IMO....  \n17:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, word on the street is everyone's using rocketchat  \n17:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0there is still no clear leader in the slack-clone sphere  \n17:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think he basically just copied Realtime+Backend which is where I originally wrote \"You probably don't want to install this directly\"  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same question for that one then  \n17:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so it's installable w/ the extension manager :)  \n17:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0as a dependency  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for that you just need it to be in a maven repo  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is the case already  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when you do mvn release:perform it puts it in a maven repo)  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wtf\u2026.  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guest deleting pages?  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who's doing imports on xwiki.org?  \n17:31\u00a0<M-yflory>\u00a0Yes, I did that because it is based on a copy of the old relatime backend (sorry, I lost the connection to Vector)  \n17:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0M-yflory: ok so no reason  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: sounds more like an uninstall actually  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"A XAR import has been started by null in wiki platform\" is an uninstall  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0talking about the deletes  \n17:32\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but I was commenting about the the xar import when I asked who's doing imports  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0M-yflory & cjd: if these are deps of other extensions then you may decide to not have them on exo  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only reason to be on exo  \n17:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If it's not on exo then we can't vote them 5 stars :D  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: sorry not not answering quickly enough to \"guest deleting pages?\" then :)  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to allow xwiki usres to find these extensions when inside EM in their wiki  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: if they are deps of other extensions there's no reason to vote for them  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you going to vote for the reandering link label generator?  \n17:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0no but we didn't write it :)  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(internal deps/extensons do not need to be visibile)  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't make sense  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again, \\*\\*if\\*\\* they are deps  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just need the top level exrensions to be there  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want to confuse users then what you're doing is definitely the best  \n17:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but it's cool to have a documentation page for it  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0create 10 extensions on exo  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which are used by a single app  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and name them similarly  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then when user search they'll have some fun  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to decide what to do withit  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a doc page that has 1 line that says the user shouldn't use it?  \n17:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, indeed we need to work on search results only showing validated extensiosn  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're serious?  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0serious : it's cool to have a one line doc that the user shouldn't use it  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/doc/doc saying  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry for my typos...  \n17:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh ok, so the reason why the original RtBackend was using an extension page was because it wasn't released with maven in the beginning  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0brain processing faster than fingers...  \n17:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0So I suppose we can delete those pages now  \n17:38\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well to be sure  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what extension draws them?  \n17:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0All of the realtime stuff uses RtBackend (and in the next version it will all use Realtime+Netflux+Backend  \n17:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0)  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n17:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it is kind of cool to have the EM page in order to show that we developed Netflux in XWiki  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, providing you have nice documentation  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise it has the opposite effect  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can still add some text about netflux in the extension drawing it  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/can/could  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just wanted to let you know about the non-necessity to have extensions published on exo  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since they're already in maven)  \n17:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, makes sense  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll let you decide what to do  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back to my other work ;)  \n17:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0have fun
