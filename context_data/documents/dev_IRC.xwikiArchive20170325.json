Can it be that when the user will be guided to the glossary page he will be given seggestions about that particular word on that page..  \n13:48\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Like For Example if a user is encountered with the word 'rendering'. He clicks on that word and then he will be guided to the glossary page.  \n13:49\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0There he will be given suggestions about things like - 'rendering architecture', 'transformation examples' etc.  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sgc072: only if that word has a glossary entry  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I said in comments, I don't think clicking is the best  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd say it should be displayed with a different style (to be defined) and when user hover overs it, a popup displays the explanation  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with a link to go to the glossary page in that popup )  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is much nicer since the user can see the definition without navigating away from the current page  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't you agree?  \n13:54\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0yes, on hovering a popup will display a small descrption of that word in the dialog box below it. But when the user will click on that word it will direct him to glossary page.  \n13:54\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Yes link to glossary page should be inside the dialog box.  \n13:54\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0thats better  \n13:55\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0dialog box == popup :P  \n14:00\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0And another question is that whether the definition of the glossary entry will be generated manually?  \n14:01\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0\u00a0Or the user will be directed to an already existing page? We just have to link that page with the glossary item.  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry back  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for adding a glossary item, I already suggested the following:  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- some user selects one or several works with the mouse  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- the user clicks a shortcut key (similar to annotations)  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- this opens a popup allowing the user to enter the definition and to save it  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- internally this creates a new page in the glossary space  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(sgc072)  \n14:13\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0yup  \n14:13\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0understood :)  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool, unless you have a better proposal ofc :)  \n14:16\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0But in the proposal, its written the definition should be atleast of one page. Isn't it mandatory?  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the definition shoud be located on a single page yes (for scalability reasons)  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not at least! exactly on one page  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/located/stored  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the scalability reason is because the alternative would be to store it in an xobject on a single page but xwiki doesn't scale that well when there are too many xobjects on the same page (it takes time to load them all)  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gtg, be back later  \n14:22\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n14:45\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:26\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:31\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:02\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:03\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0Hi vmassol , Like annotations the complete definition of the selected word would be displayed on the same page?  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sgc\\_072: you mean on hover?  \n19:00\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0yes  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess an extract/summary would be displayed  \n19:01\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0Yeah that what I wanted to know.  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if it's too long the full text would be on the glossary page for that term  \n19:01\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0yeah right.  \n19:02\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0One more thing. On adding a new entry I think the user should be directed to a new page.  \n19:02\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0I mean if the definition is quite long, it would look ugly  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it's easier to type in context  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but what the user could be filling in context could be the summary and he could cick to enter more details maybe  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*click  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(click = navigate to the glossary page)  \n19:04\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0yeah, this would be right.  \n19:04\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0I didn't thought of the context thing :P.  \n19:17\u00a0<sgc\\_072>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<dmidma>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:29\u00a0<dmidma>\u00a0Hello world!
