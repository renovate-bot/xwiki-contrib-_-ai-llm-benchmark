You could simply use spaces for different groups. Depends on your exact needs  \n10:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0In postgres you have to create a whole new tcp connection for each database. Then Hibernate can't do connection pooling and we would need a seperate pool for each db.  \n10:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But yes, almost anything you would need multiple wikis for you can do with multiple spaces  \n10:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Aside from the obvious, providing wiki as a service to customers.  \n10:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Re the tests, my wild theory at the moment is that something is opening a connection on that port and refusing to close it.  \n10:19\u00a0<hanasaki>\u00a0vmassol: \u00a0just a small yet complete setup  \n10:19\u00a0<hanasaki>\u00a0later might migrate to full psotgres..  \n10:19\u00a0<hanasaki>\u00a0does xem work w/ h2?  \n10:19\u00a0<hanasaki>\u00a0hsqldb?  \n10:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0IIRC, you can make a program so you have to kill -4 it to stop it by opening a tcp connection and then filtering FIN and RST packets.  \n10:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0For the moment, XEM only works with mysql.  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: is that true?  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I thought it was working with other dbs)  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oracle?  \n10:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's supposed to work Oracle yes  \n10:22\u00a0<hanasaki>\u00a0since its hibernate based... what's the issue w/ other dbs  \n10:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I kind of tried to avoid recommending Oracle since none of us have it installed.  \n10:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0only other one I know it's working on but never used it myself  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: does xwiki sas have setup on oracle for xem?  \n10:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: 99% sure  \n10:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0used to for sure at least  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:24\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<hanasaki>\u00a0so where does xwiki get its $ from since its opensource?  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://xwiki.com  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(see the list of services/solutions offered)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are other companies offering services too  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Support  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0more specifically: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Support#HProfessionalSupport  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol> ? http://www.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Offer/Support  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol> ? http://www.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Offer/Hosting  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol> ? http://www.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Offer/Development  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol> ? http://www.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Offer/Consulting  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol> ? http://www.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Offer/Training  \n10:29\u00a0<hanasaki>\u00a0ah  \n10:29\u00a0<hanasaki>\u00a0but until the stuff I do grows...
