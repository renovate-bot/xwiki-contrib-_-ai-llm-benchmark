As in, they don't show up in preview or saved page?  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:47  \ncjdelisle - (09:49): kwoot: Are you using mysql and are the very small images ok?  \ncjdelisle - (09:50): If so, it's probably the mysql max\\_packet\\_size  \ncjdelisle - (09:51): The image fails to save but the sneaky cache fools you... \u00a0until you restart the wiki engine.  \ncjdelisle - (09:51): Cache coherency should be fixed in 2.5  \nkwoot - (09:55): Thanks for the hint. I will let dba know about this.  \nkwoot - (09:57): Thinking about it. \u00a0Actually we currently use Oracle for the db. the attachments at the bottom seem fine, but I can only imclude with the 'image:' tag and not with the '[[image:file||options]]\u00b4 tag.  \ncjdelisle - (09:58): Hmm. definitely not the mysql issue then.  \nkwoot - (09:59): nope. did a mogrify of jpeg files to png but no change.  \ntmortagne - (10:00): kwoot: could you look at what is the difference in the produced html when you use image:file or [[image:file]], it's supposed to be the same thing so I don't understand why one works when the other does not  \nkwoot - (10:01): sure. one moment  \nkwoot - (10:01): btw, using google chrome/  \nkwoot - (10:03): <img src=\"/xwiki/bin/download/IT%20Projecten/Project%20projecttooling/screenshot020.png\" class=\"wikimodel-freestanding\" alt=\"screenshot020.png\"/> <img src=\"/xwiki/bin/download/IT%20Projecten/Project%20projecttooling/screenshot020.png\" alt=\"Onepoint Basic, open source versie\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\"/>  \nkwoot - (10:03): they seem fine. after edit the first image shows up as a html-broken-image/image-not-found link. But during edit they seem fine. Strange.  \ntmortagne - (10:04): both html image are the ok and the same except the height/with parameter, does it works if you don't put any parameter ?  \ntmortagne - (10:05): maybe chrome has some bugs percent resizing or something  \nkwoot - (10:05): Main/AllDocs?view=attachments shows no attachments in the wiki. Strange?  \nkwoot - (10:06): Maybe upload dir access rights?  \ntmortagne - (10:07): if image:file works it has nothing to do with the attachment itself i think  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 10:07  \nkwoot - (10:09): very, very strange. just started firefox.

Other big companies use this library  \nsburjan - (11:27): yes, we should print .. not everybody checks the console  \ntmortagne - (11:28): at least we could say \"you should have looked at the log\" ;)  \nsburjan - (11:28): yeah ....  \nsburjan - (11:29): tmortagne: are you familiar with JODConverter source code ?

So it's either a distro (ubuntu) thing, or I don;t know. Butthe problem isn't with JODConverter either.  \nmflorea - (13:22): sburjan: what are you trying to do?  \nsburjan - (13:23): to start OOServer in internal mode without modifying the xwiki.proprieties page.  \nsburjan - (13:24): but it seem there is no other way, but just to edit the file and put manually the path  \nmflorea - (13:24): what's \"internal mode\"?  \nsburjan - (13:25): internal mode is when xwiki start OOserver by itself.  \nmflorea - (13:25): I see  \nsburjan - (13:25): OO Server doesnt put an env path to system, so all the apps that could use it, to get that path and start it in the background  \nsburjan - (13:25): this thing will increase portability  \nsburjan - (13:26): if all the linux family would have same PATH for OO.. or at least have that one  \nsburjan - (13:27): so this is in Oracle's hands or in every distro maker  \nsburjan - (13:27): EOF  \nmflorea - (13:27): what's wrong with setting the path in xwiki.properties?  \nsburjan - (13:28): nothing, just another step.
