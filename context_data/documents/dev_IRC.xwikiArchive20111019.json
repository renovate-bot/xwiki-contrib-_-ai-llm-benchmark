You gave me some scripts but I couldn't run them on my mac...  \n15:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, I'll do it  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0great thanks :)  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: did you use the Template for creating the new RN?  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(i don't think you did)  \n16:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: nop I copied 3.2M1 actually, did not know there was a template  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you click on Add Page  \n16:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i see it misses the supported browsers section  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's now a template i created  \n16:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know if it's useful yet  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but there's only one way to know\u2026 :)  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to try using it)  \n16:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n16:06\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yepp. I was thinking about this for the MTR's also, but I don;t think it's okay to crowd the Add Page options  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not crowded sburjan  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's only activated for a given space  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but IMO the best for RN might be to create a small App similar to Extensions  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's probably better than a static Template)  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Templates are so Wiki 1.0 IMO ;))  \n16:08\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:d  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'll recreate the page  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah you're doing it?
