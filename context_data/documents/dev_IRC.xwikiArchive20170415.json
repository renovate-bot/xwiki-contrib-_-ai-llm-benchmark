Would you mind sending a mail on the xwiki users list and I'll answer there when I get some time? I'm the maintainer of the xwiki docker image so I can work with you to make it simpler to configure  \n17:47\u00a0<btorch>\u00a0vmassol: thank you, sure I'll check on the xwiki users list ..I think I have discovered my issue though after accessing the container with bash  \n17:47\u00a0<btorch>\u00a0I'm also going to map the /usr/local/tomcat to a volume which I didn't have before and I found the files I have to edit in there as well  \n17:58\u00a0<slayerjain>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:11\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:40\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit\n"}
