I deployed the new WAR file. Now I want also to update the XAR. But I can't login because there is no login link on the start page anymore.  \naaao - (16:24): With Firefox I can use: View, Page Style, No Style. Then I see the login link. :-)  \nsdumitriu - (16:27): It could be a cached style issue  \nsdumitriu - (16:27): You can Shift+Refresh to force a cache refresh  \naaao - (16:30): Too late. Can't test it anymore. Already imported the XAR and now everything looks good. :-)  \naaao - (16:32): Is there a way to disable the icons?  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 16:42  \nsdumitriu - (16:58): Which icons?  \naaao left at 17:04 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)  \naaao joined #xwiki at 17:05  \naaao left #xwiki at 17:09  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 17:12  \ntmortagne left at 17:13 (Client Quit  \nvmassol left at 17:19 (Client Quit  \nKermitTheFragger left at 17:19 (\"Leaving\"  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 19:02  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 21:15  \nxwiki-bridge left at 21:15 (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 21:15  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:25): I can't save user pages... \"Field users in object XWiki.Admin has an invalid name\" \u00a0Going to wipe the db and try from a fresh import...  \nsdumitriu - (21:27): Could be caused by Vincent's refactoring  \nvmassol - (21:27): CalebJamesDeLisl: are you sure you're up to date re svn?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:27): As of yesterday.  \nvmassol - (21:27): should be ok then  \nvmassol - (21:28): how can I reproduce?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:28): Edit your user page, click save and view.  \nvmassol - (21:28): trying  \nvmassol - (21:30): working fine  \nvmassol - (21:30): here's what I did:  \nsdumitriu - (21:30): wfm  \nvmassol - (21:30): go to my user page  \nvmassol - (21:30): edit (using new profile)  \nvmassol - (21:30): change about section  \nvmassol - (21:30): save  \nvmassol - (21:31): CalebJamesDeLisl: there error you have is one that I fixed  \nvmassol - (21:31): but I fixed it 2-3 days ago  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:31): I guess my svn is older than I thought.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:31): Good that it's fixed.  \nvmassol - (21:41): sdumitriu: what would be nice too for comments is the ability to edit them from the view display  \nsdumitriu - (21:43): Yeah  \nmflorea left at 21:46 (\"Leaving.\"  \nSvenDowideit left at 22:12 (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)  \nSvenDowiu joined #xwiki at 22:12  \nSvenDowiu is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \n\n"}
