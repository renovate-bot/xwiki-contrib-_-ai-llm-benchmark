 \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:38): Correct.  \nvmassol - (11:39): so the question is wheter we envision invitation as a must have in a wiki  \nvmassol - (11:39): personally I don't think it's a must have  \nvmassol - (11:39): ie the wiki should work fine without it  \nsdumitriu - (11:39): abusenius: You should assign the issues you're trying to fix to youself, so that I don't start working in parallel on the same thing  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:40): Well if it is packaged with XE then whether it's a must have or not it will be default.  \nvmassol - (11:40): CalebJamesDeLisl: someone must be able to create a custom wiki  \nvmassol - (11:41): like it's not because the blog app is bundled in XE  \nvmassol - (11:41): that I cannot create a wiki where I don't have the blog app  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:41): You can also create a wiki which doesn't have XWiki.Registration because it defaults to using registerinline.vm  \nvmassol - (11:41): Note: I'm not 100% sure re invitation/registration, I'm just trying to play the devil's advocate here to ensure we take a sound decision ;)  \nvmassol - (11:42): CalebJamesDeLisl: yes the question is whether someone might want registration but not invitation  \nvmassol - (11:42): if there's no strong compelling reason to have them together then it looks better to have them separate  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:42): A sound decision is what I want, I am never sure of my ideas.  \nSvenDowi- joined #xwiki at 11:42  \nvmassol - (11:42): (but possible with a dep from the invitation manager to the registrtion app)  \nvmassol - (11:42): s/possible/possibly/  \nSvenDowi- is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nabusenius - (11:42): sdumitriu, I don't think I can assign them to me, I'm not a committer, or at least I don't see how  \nvmassol - (11:43): abusenius: you can assign even if you're not committer  \nvmassol - (11:43): (unless someone changes the rights recently....)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:43): I guess the question is: \"should XWiki.Registration (bells and whistles) be bound to the invitation app?\"  \nvmassol - (11:43): s/changes/changed/  \nannacondan left at 11:44 (Quit: annacondan  \nabusenius - (11:44): vmassol, \u00a0mmm how?
