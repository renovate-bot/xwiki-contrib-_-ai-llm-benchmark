With normal sql you would end up doing horrific like 'something%somethingElse%' type searches which would take forever.  \n20:17\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but we I only expect to allow finite and well defined parameters  \n20:17\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0and this at the \"typed\" reference level  \n20:18\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0only the entity reference expose \"generic\" parameters  \n20:18\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0and this is only for the sake of the implementation, these are protected methods  \n20:20\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0you can look at the feature-immutable-refs branch for details on my implementation  \n20:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry guys got to go get my son, caleb remember that a URL or URI is a reference and it allows parameters\u2026. we need somehow to be able to carry the same kind of information  \n20:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0URL parameters are different, they are arguments which are passed to the page when it is \"executed\" they are not descriminators for which page to load.  \n20:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0URI are references and are meaningful  \n20:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the params are optional but needed to qualify the reference  \n20:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like the anchor, version, locale, etc  \n20:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go sorry :)  \n20:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ok, we can continue on the list.  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw guys, my comments were about Denis implementation  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not about the proposal  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the proposal was already discused adn vote  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0voted  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from I see you don't agree about the initial proplsal  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you should resend a vote for it then  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I assumed everyone agreed since it was voted  \n20:24\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0only dumbs do not change their minds :)  \n20:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Well it has not been implemented so as I see it, there is plenty of time for us to continue discussion.  \n20:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That thinking would make more sense if a lot of work had been put in to the implentation of that design but according to Denis, the version part has not been done, nor has the arbitrary parameters  \n20:28\u00a0<CIA-102>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f feature-applicationWithinMinutes\u000f \\* r8490e36\u000f \u000f/ (7 files):\u000f AppWithinMinutes ...  \n20:29\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0arbitrary parameters are implemented, but not exposed, so the only thing that is implemented is the availability of a parameter mechanism  \n20:29\u00a0<CIA-102>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f feature-applicationWithinMinutes\u000f \\* ra2a36ed\u000f \u000f/ (5 files in 3 dirs):\u000f Merge branch 'master' of github.com:xwiki/xwiki-platform into feature-applicationWithinMinutes - http://git.io/NaGR5g  \n20:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but may remind that we should have released on Monday, so we should keep the discussion short if possible :)  \n20:34\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Oups, just noticed that arbitrary parameters are available on EntityReference and it would more difficult not to have this  \n20:36\u00a0<CIA-102>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r8490e36\u000f \u000f/ (7 files):\u000f AppWithinMinutes ...  \n20:36\u00a0<CIA-102>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* ra2a36ed\u000f \u000f/ (5 files in 3 dirs):\u000f Merge branch 'master' of github.com:xwiki/xwiki-platform into feature-applicationWithinMinutes - http://git.io/NaGR5g  \n20:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:40\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so since we can convert EntityReference to DocumentReference, ensuring not arbitrary parameters will anyway require checking the map.  \n20:42\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0BUT NOT SURE THIS IS REALLY NEEDE  \n20:42\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0oups  \n20:42\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0caps locks in my back  \n20:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm  \n20:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0mail sent  \n21:00\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0cjdelisle: nice remarks about Serializable, I am fixing this right now  \n21:16\u00a0<nimbvs>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:17\u00a0<nimbvs>\u00a0hi. is the [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) mailing list working?  \n21:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it seems to be, I see mail from today  \n21:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0did you send a perticular message which you don't think made it?  \n21:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*particular  \n21:19\u00a0<nimbvs>\u00a0well, I just subscribed and sent a message  \n21:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0what was the topic?  \n21:19\u00a0<nimbvs>\u00a0but I received something strange back:  \n21:19\u00a0<nimbvs>\u00a0Sorry.
