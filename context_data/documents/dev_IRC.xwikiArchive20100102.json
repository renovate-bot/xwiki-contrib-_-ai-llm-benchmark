Alright. I got it anyway.  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:49): [Cindy Mitchell] But I do has a different question.  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:50): [Cindy Mitchell] how would I fetch content, then? o.o \u00a0I'm designing a theme, and I want to generally fetch page content and display it in my own format.. <.<  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:52): [sdumitriu] $doc.content or $doc.getRenderedContent()  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:53): [Cindy Mitchell] hm  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:53): [Cindy Mitchell] Okie.  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:53): [Cindy Mitchell] can I get the rendered content for another $doc?

 \nxwiki-bridge - (01:55): [Lady Serena Kitty] I think its something like $xwiki.getDocument(\"documentname\").content  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:55): [sdumitriu] $xwiki.getDocument('Some.Document').renderedContent  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:57): [Cindy Mitchell] ah.  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:57): \\*\\*\\* Lady Serena Kitty is thinking of just deleting all the local groups on some of her wikis  \nxwiki-bridge - (01:58): [Cindy Mitchell] hmm  \nxwiki-bridge - (02:02): [Cindy Mitchell] Oh wow  \nxwiki-bridge - (02:02): [Cindy Mitchell] XWiki is like insanely simple to skin.  \nxwiki-bridge - (02:05): [Cindy Mitchell] so okay  \nxwiki-bridge - (02:05): [Cindy Mitchell] is it XWiki.Header  \nxwiki-bridge - (02:05): [Cindy Mitchell] ?

 \nxwiki-bridge - (03:12): [Lady Serena Kitty] if its defined in the skin class, then no  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:13): [Lady Serena Kitty] but if you attach it to the skin document, then yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:14): [Cindy Mitchell] so, then-  \nxwiki-bridge - (03:14): [Cindy Mitchell] #include('header.vm') ?

eg: \"The current document: $doc\" would link to http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/DevGuide/API/xwiki%2Dcore%2D2.1.1%2Djavadoc.jar/com/xpn/xwiki/api/Document.html It would need updating by version but would be very useful.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:41): Maybe there could be an xwiki-core-current-javadoc.jar which sends a redirect to the current version.  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:46): [NielsMayer] i just started using davfs2-1.3.3-3.fc12.x86\\_64 with xwiki via \"mount -t davfs http://tsp/xwiki/webdav /mnt/davtsp/\" are there any client-side scripts (e.g. groovy) that can be run on the .xml extension files in order to extract JSX and SSX objects embedded within (and un-xmlenconde, e.g. getting rid of transformed &...); also the reverse to package up \\*.css, \\*.js and \\*.vm into a xwiki xml doc for storage   \nSvenDowiu joined #xwiki at 20:46  \nxwiki-bridge - (20:56): [NielsMayer] for example the dav view of the filesystem would have 'home/wiki.xml' representing document Main.WebHome but if there were objects, it would be preferable to have a compound document represented by another level of directory i the dav view, and then have the contents of document as a wiki.vm, and the SSX's and JSX's as wiki-N.js and wiki-N.css, tags as .tag etc  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:59): That's neat Niels, I have been working on revamping the skinx extension as a component, I still have to write some tests and get XWikiServlet working.  \nSvenDowideit left at 21:00 (Read error: 101 (Network is unreachable)  \nSvenDowiu is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:01): You were wondering about the security level of passwords, the answer is it's not that great, there should be salting and/or \"stretching\" the algorithm to make rainbow tables unfeasible.  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:11): [NielsMayer] CalebJamesDeLisle: currently /mnt/davxwiki/spaces/XWiki/\\_A\\_/Admin/wiki.xml shows \"<password>hash:SHA-512: ...</password>\" so at least it's not in the clear  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:14): [NielsMayer] so any suggestions on how to unpack a file like /mnt/davxwiki/spaces/XWiki/\\_A\\_/Admin/wiki.xml into its constituent components just using a standalone java, groovy script or ant task?  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:18): [NielsMayer] (the next step from there is that since DAV is a superset of subversion ( http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.webdav.autoversioning.html ) to use a remix of xwiki's dav to allow direct subversion checkin/out to xwiki )  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:18): My Pentium 4 will do about 95,000 SHA-512 hashes per second so building a rainbow table would be faster then it should.  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:20): [NielsMayer] true, but i might find the effort more worthwhile preventing people from accessing passwords  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:20): Constituent components? Like the XDOM or like breaking it into objects, classes, macros etc?  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:21): [NielsMayer] for example use a single password table akin to the /etc/shadow in unix rather than having password in XWiki.<user>  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:21): [NielsMayer] and have that single document locked down hard, and only accessible through a few narrow api's  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:22): Those are good ideas, but it's very easy to make the password class hash the password say 100 times which would make cracking take 100 times as long.  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:23): [NielsMayer] for example certain admin-sensitive docs could only be accessed by certain IPs (and in better security cases, SSH client certs)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:23): [NielsMayer] 100 isn't a very exciting number in cryptography :-)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:23): However watch out for groovy. It ruins all security.  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:23): [NielsMayer] unless its like 100 times the age of trhe universe or something like that  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:24): [NielsMayer] yeah that was a very intersting find  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:25): [NielsMayer] seems like other languages are also blind to this bug. i brought it up on clojure and they were all \"we solve this problem by not solving it\" which is basically the groovy copout  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:25): Another trick is generate an 8 byte random number and append it to the password as a byte array before hashing. Then add the random number (plaintext) to the stored password hash.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:25): eg: salting  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:25): s/eg:/meaning  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:26): [NielsMayer] \u00a0true.. that might be an easy fix too  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:27): Another neat thing is jbcrypt which is a method of hashing which takes a looooong time so making rainbow tables is unfeasible.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:27): Too bad it isn't in a maven repo.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:28): The advantage of salting is that it makes the amount of time required to generate a rainbow table now become the amount of time required to crack one password :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:29): [NielsMayer] imho, you can't neccessarily rely on language features for security anyways... so having a components use some kind of digital signature to ensure valid access between eachother them seems like the ultimate way of securing   \nxwiki-bridge - (21:30): [NielsMayer] i.e. it doesn't matter if you can see \"methods\" that you shouldn't have access to.. they'll error out once they check the caller's auth and id.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:31): That is a good idea, i think there is a method in reflection api for get calling method.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:31): If you like I can email you my java test program and my findings.  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:32): [NielsMayer] you need an external structure to define access levels, e.g. http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=76148 (very old paper, i was undergrad research assistant on this project, but same old idea)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:33): Do you have the pdf?  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:33): [NielsMayer] please yes do email them  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:40): [NielsMayer] i don't have the pdf but ossher's work is old so there should be pdfs or references online. for example \"For example,\u00a0Ossher's grid\u00a0mechanism [18] can de- scribe and restrict an individual program's structure in many dimensions (for instance, modules and lev..\" --> http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/notkin/papers/icse-singapore.pdf  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:42): [NielsMayer] the basic idea is simple. a grid can represent a directed acyclic graph... so use a grid (multiple grids actually, one per \"view\" or \"aspect\") to represent what is allowed to access what. (as opposed to simpler models like ISO layer model which never work in real world).  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:44): That is very interesting. My first thought is \"Or make them private and throw groovy overboard\" ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:45): [NielsMayer] i like groovy. i'd prefer clojure and it would be a better match for the domain, but i'm done w/ language wars  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:46): I also like Groovy and dislike language wars but that one bug/feature is rather aggravating.  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:47): [NielsMayer] well it's fixed in 2.0  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:47): [NielsMayer] it sounds like a 2.0 kind of fix  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:47): [NielsMayer] of course when 2.0 will be available...  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:49): [NielsMayer] but since groovy appears to have a future, i'm not that worried for now...   \nxwiki-bridge - (21:49): [NielsMayer] and in some unforseeable future when i have time, i've been long wanting to add clojure as a jsr223 lang in xwiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:50): [NielsMayer] then i'd never need groovy again (i'm an old lisp programmer, prevented from using \u00a0proper programing languages for decades)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:50): Yes, I hope they don't push it up to 2.1 at the last minute.  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:52): [NielsMayer] given that all those access level bugs are \"top ranked\" in jira, i would hope that is their focus for 2.x  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:52): It seems that adding closure would make XWiki cover just about all types of languages. Am I wrong?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:53): Yes and they can put in a backward compatibility switch for people who just need everything public.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:54): Did you get the email?  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:54): [NielsMayer] yes, clojure would make xwiki the most multilingual wiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:55): [NielsMayer] i'd actually want to strip out some of the langs that i dont like like python  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:55): [NielsMayer] jpython used for formatting {{code}}  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:56): I don't like python (because I don't like type un-safety), but I like the options.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:56): I think pygments was compiled to a java jar and runs independently of jython.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:57): If I ever get around to making a redhat rpm distribution, I would like to make all unnecessary things packaged in separate rpms.  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:58): [NielsMayer] i don't like languages that use newlines and indentation (invisible constructs) to represent structure  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:58): [NielsMayer] a redhat rpm distro would be a great ide  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:58): [NielsMayer] a  \nxwiki-bridge - (21:59): [NielsMayer] for one, get it packaged along w/ fedora (whichalrady has working mysql/tomcat6 rpms)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:59): I would also have some GPL rpms like ruby and php.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:00): I would package for jetty (which is also in the fedora repo)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:00): I would also allow a choice between mysql and postgres which are both in the fedora repo.  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:00): [NielsMayer] yeah. great idea. i'll be happy to test your rpms. basically, my goal for admining my xwiki system i'm trying to launch is to use standard f12 other than \u00a0Sun JDK  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:01): Getting it working with GNU JRE is worrying.  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:02): [NielsMayer] i think it works with OpenJDK, it's just i don't want to worry about bugs  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:02): [NielsMayer] or diffs  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:02): [NielsMayer] basically tomcat6 insists on adding OpenJDK as a prereq  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:03): I wonder why they haven't switched to Sun VM, it's GPL'd  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:03): [NielsMayer] and i just rpm -e --nodep OpenJDK and reinstall sun's jdk  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:03): [NielsMayer] i had a little arg. w/ the people on #fedora about that  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:03): Is OpenJDK in the fedora repo?  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:03): [NielsMayer] they're quite dogmatic about what's in or out  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:03): [NielsMayer] yes openjdk is there  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:03): Dependency :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:04): [NielsMayer] and they claim there's no need for sun's jdk  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:04): I say give the user choices.  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:05): [NielsMayer] java-1.6.0-openjdk.i686 : OpenJDK Runtime Environment java-1.6.0-openjdk.x86\\_64 : OpenJDK Runtime Environment  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:05): [NielsMayer] java-1.6.0-openjdk-demo.x86\\_64 : OpenJDK Demos java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel.x86\\_64 : OpenJDK Development Environment java-1.6.0-openjdk-javadoc.x86\\_64 : OpenJDK API Documentation java-1.6.0-openjdk-plugin.x86\\_64 : OpenJDK Web Browser Plugin java-1.6.0-openjdk-src.x86\\_64 : OpenJDK Source Bundle R-java.x86\\_64 : R with Fedora provided Java Runtime Environment  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:06): However I won't get moving on this until I upgrade from F9 to F12. I don't want to do that until I have a new computer.

Good to hear.  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:20): [NielsMayer] well i'll let you know. for $700.00 i built a much nicer box than anything else i could compare   \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:20): Remember the days when you could buy cheaper than you could build?  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:22): [NielsMayer] they've been claiming tht for years. i think everyhing in the opty is available in the amd64 arch which is what they target  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:22): [NielsMayer] i think what happens is amd introduces the opty, then 6 mos later, the same comes out as consumer.  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:23): [NielsMayer] so if we see 6 core consumer chips a year from now they might just be consumer optys  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:24): [NielsMayer] i actually had a need for speed on my project. i'm doing a lot of DSP and presenting the results in xwiki  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:24): DSP?  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:25): [NielsMayer] digital signal processing  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:25): sound? video? radio?  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:25): [NielsMayer] for audio and video  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:25): [NielsMayer] http://nielsmayer.com/prototype-11-17-2009.jpg  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:27): Hmmm. That info is being pulled from the audio stream? What is it used for?  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:30): [NielsMayer] helping people figure out the structure of streaming media  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:31): [NielsMayer] and annotate, commment, share clip, etc  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:31): It sounds like it has value in the compression field -> choosing which algorithm to use for a given segment.  \nxwiki-bridge - (22:32): [NielsMayer] well hopefully a dynamic compression algo will be handling that :-)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:33): I guess that's what I meant, as part of the dynamic compression algorithm.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:56): I just double checked the space requirements for sha-512 rainbow tables. 8 character password using only lower case letters and numbers = 180TB less worrying then I thought.  \nxwiki-bridge - (23:48): [NielsMayer] nice  \n  \n{{/code}}\n"}
