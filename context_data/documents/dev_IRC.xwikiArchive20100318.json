I have to confess my lack of understanding about how ssl authentication works.  \nbblfish - (13:19): https has a session mechanism, I think  \nbblfish - (13:19): heh: it's really simple  \nbblfish - (13:19): we hacked the ssl layer  \nbblfish - (13:19): so we accept any certificate, even self signed  \nbblfish - (13:20): then we pass that to the application layer that does the verification  \nbblfish - (13:20): that code is here  \nbblfish - (13:20): <dependency>  \nbblfish - (13:20): <groupId>org.openrdf.sesame</groupId>  \nbblfish - (13:20): <artifactId>sesame-sail-nativerdf</artifactId>  \nbblfish - (13:20): <version>${sesame.version}</version>  \nbblfish - (13:20): </dependency>  \nbblfish - (13:20): heu  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:20): Okay so you just get the sessionId from the HttpServletSession and do your validation, then as long as that stays the same all is good.  \nbblfish - (13:20): http://github.com/bblfish/foafssl-java/blob/master/foafssl-verifier/src/main/java/net/java/dev/sommer/foafssl/verifier/DereferencingFoafSslVerifier.java  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:21): brb coffee :)  \nbblfish - (13:21): ah ok, me too then  \nglerouge1 joined #xwiki at 13:25  \nxenon75 left at 13:25 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nxenon75 joined #xwiki at 13:25  \nflorinciu left at 13:26 (Quit: Leaving.  \nglerouge left at 13:29 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nbblfish - (13:30): I am just refactoring that code, btw  \nbblfish - (13:31): there is a SPARQL query in there  \nbblfish - (13:31): the inputstream is the from an http connection to the WebId  \nbblfish - (13:33): ah no, its not even used.

It can the GET that webid for more info about him  \nbblfish - (13:46): s/the/then/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:47): Right I'm still not understanding what the user passes to xwiki to prove that they are not using someone else's id.  \nbblfish - (13:47): CalebJamesDeLisl: did you make a WebId on webid.myxwiki.org ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:47): It seems to me that the xwiki auth code must check the client cert.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 13:48  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:48): No I haven't. I'm weird about having to read things before I use them :)  \nbblfish - (13:48): well, you don't have to read, you just have to do  \nbblfish - (13:48): :-)  \nbblfish - (13:48): go make yourself an account  \nbblfish - (13:49): click the create webid button and look at the certificate it generated  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:49): What will I be doing with it?:  \nbblfish - (13:49): You can then login to other sites  \nbblfish - (13:49): it just will be easier to understand  \nbblfish - (13:49): and you don't have to read! :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:50): Oh yes I do :) Security stuff always looks like it works.  \nbblfish - (13:50): yes, but if you get the feel, it will tune your inutions  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:51): Anyway I don't think logging in will tell me what I need to provide the auth module.  \nbblfish - (13:51): Please try it  \nbblfish - (13:51): It's 2 min  \nbblfish - (13:51): I spent days putting that together  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:52): Well I'll set up an account but then I have to read the code to find how the login process works.  \nbblfish - (13:53): Well I can help you there  \nbblfish - (13:53): but it will be much faster to understand  \nbblfish - (13:54): ok so you have a home page now  \nbblfish - (13:54): there is a button, submit cert requrest.

I forgot  \nbblfish - (14:00): yes, that's an issue I am trying to resolve  \nbblfish - (14:01): in your certificate Preferences->Advanced->  \nMichelleShi - (14:02): myxwiki.org down?  \nbblfish - (14:02): yes, it seems like it is  \nbblfish - (14:02): Preferences->Advanced->view certificates you will see your certs  \nbblfish - (14:03): in the cert you will find your public key and your web id  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:03): Yes I just logged in to test.foafssl.org and it let me pick a cert.  \nbblfish - (14:03): that is what the code http://github.com/bblfish/foafssl-java/blob/master/foafssl-verifier/src/main/java/net/java/dev/sommer/foafssl/verifier/DereferencingFoafSslVerifier.java  \nbblfish - (14:03): verifies  \nbblfish - (14:03): it verifies that the public key in your cert matches the one in your foaf  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:04): re myxwiki down: see what happens when you get me to touch something? ;)  \nbblfish - (14:04): I don't think that webid.myx\u2026 could shut down myxwiki too ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:05): Yea it's a \"virtual wiki\"  \nMichelleShi - (14:05): when will myxwiki be available again?  \nbblfish - (14:05): perhaps I introduced an infinite loop in the code?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:05): XWiki scalability is very cool. \u00a0it should restart in a few minutes.  \nsdumitriu - (14:06): myxwiki: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space  \nbblfish - (14:06): is there a stack trace?  \nsdumitriu - (14:06): I believe that pygments/jython has a problem  \nsdumitriu - (14:07): I think {{code}} triggers this  \nbblfish - (14:07): mhh, I don't use pygments, jython  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:07): Might have been on the edge and I tipped it over getting that cert.  \nsdumitriu - (14:07): bblfish: It's not your fault  \nsdumitriu - (14:08): It's just a coincidence  \nbblfish - (14:08): CalebJamesDeLisl: I don't think you created a cert  \nbblfish - (14:08): thre is nothing http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/aUser  \nbblfish - (14:08): or it crashed just then  \nbblfish - (14:09): oh wait, looking in wrong place  \nbblfish - (14:09): ah no  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:10): hmm, I have a cert in the browser. Maybe sending it made it load one more class, straw that broke the camel's back so to speak.  \nMichelleShi - (14:10): It's available now.  \nbblfish - (14:10): yes, it was a bit slow  \nbblfish - (14:11): anyway, the way it works is by you having a certificate with a webid insides ( A URL for you) and then an http GET on http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/aUser should show your public key  \nbblfish - (14:11): you should delete your certificates  \nbblfish - (14:11): and try again  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:14): forgot the password I had used.  \nbblfish - (14:16): ok, well let me know when you are back on track...  \nbblfish - (14:16): I'll do some refactoring  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:16): got it. and generated a new cert.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:17): Redirect back to the user page would be cool...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:17): I found out why my certs aren't going to the right place.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:18): I seem to get kicked out of login when I go to generate a cert.  \nbblfish - (14:18): ok, damn I tried fixing something recently...  \nbblfish - (14:19): let me try  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:19): mmm create local objects, show certificate. fun fun/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:20): \"simulate input from a personal profile document\" wonder what this button does :)  \nbblfish - (14:20): CalebJamesDeLisl: I just created a cert  \nbblfish - (14:21): did you click the advanced button?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:21): of course  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:21): You wonder how I break things.  \nbblfish - (14:21): ok, so then you have to create a certificate on the advanced page :-)  \nbblfish - (14:21): it just allows you to set a shorter time to live and test the whole script  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:21): Yea the advanced page kicked me out of login.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:22): So I had to login and go back there.  \nbblfish - (14:22): I clicked advanced and am still logged in  \nbblfish - (14:23): ok I also created a cert in advanced in FF  \nvmassol - (14:23): sdumitriu: is it you who fixed the pb on massol.myxwiki.org?  \nvmassol - (14:23): (it's ok now)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:25): bblfish: I noticed your rdf stuff is in the document body so you were able to solve the http parser issue?  \nsdumitriu - (14:25): vmassol: No, myxwiki got restarted, and the problematic macro didn't get loaded yet  \nvmassol - (14:25): ah ok  \nbblfish - (14:26): yes, it was not a problem of the parser. It was bad html  \nbblfish - (14:26): now the page is xhtml 1.1 compliant I think  \nbblfish - (14:26): xhtml 1.1/rdfa compliant to be exact  \nbblfish - (14:27): are you logged in as aUser?  \nbblfish - (14:27): that could be your problem. You can't create a cert if you are not logged in as aUser  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:27): Yes. still trying to find the public key in the user page.  \nbblfish - (14:27): it's not there  \nbblfish - (14:28): don't click the advanced buttone when makeing a cert  \nbblfish - (14:28): let's keep things simple  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:28): Ahh yes, kicked out of login again.  \nbblfish - (14:28): is that perhaps because you don't have a first and last name?  \nbblfish - (14:30): ah you have a key now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:30): I don't know. I think vincent's script just deletes users doesn't kick them out.  \nbblfish - (14:30): http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/aUser  \nbblfish - (14:30): you have a key  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:30): Yes I have a key but kicked out again.  \nvmassol - (14:30): CalebJamesDeLisl: yes  \nvmassol - (14:31): CalebJamesDeLisl: it's not supposed to be needed anymore if you can configure your reg feature  \nvmassol - (14:31): to not allow empty names and ensure first name != last name  \nvmassol - (14:31): + captcha enabled  \nvmassol - (14:31): would be great if this could be configured on wiki.org and myxwiki.org  \nbblfish - (14:32): perhaps there is a bug in my velocity code http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/WebId/XWikiUserProfileSheet  \nsdumitriu - (14:32): So many people on IRC today... Is it because of GSoC?  \nbblfish - (14:32): perhaps I don't do $! somewhere  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:33): I can make that change. I still have an class/object based way to configure the registration page sitting on the hard disk.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:34): Hmm, I think I'm getting kicked out because no username and password cookies are being set anymore.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:34): just jsession  \nbblfish - (14:34): ok, so not my code?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:35): I think it is not.  \nbblfish - (14:36): the code here http://www.myxwiki.org/  \nbblfish - (14:36): the web page looks broken  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:38): Yes it does.  \nlucaa left at 14:39 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:39): Interestingly, my global username at myxwiki.org works (username and password cookies are set)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:40): Yet the local username at webid does not work. Probably configuration, I don't think anything was changed in the auth code.  \nvmassol - (14:43): page fixed  \nbblfish - (14:43): no, I only added WebId/ tree  \nbblfish - (14:44): I think recenlty we did something so that it returns rdfa doctype  \nbblfish - (14:44): but I can't see that affecting anything  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:44): bblfish: https://foafssl.org/srv/idp reads back my /aUser#me page  \nbblfish - (14:45): yes, it does an HTTP get on it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:45): So where does the login happen?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:45): It looks like that page wants to be used to login somewhere else.  \nbblfish - (14:47): have you removed all you extranous broken certs from your browser?  \nbblfish - (14:47): then go here: http://nanoblog.me/  \nbblfish - (14:47): at the top is a login to your account link, it shows you how currently foafssl.org is working. (though I am about to rewrite it)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:49): I just pasted foaf.me into the text field at the page I was on and now it thinks I'm logged in...  \nbblfish - (14:49): I don't know where you are  \nbblfish - (14:50): what page are you looking at  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:51): http://foaf.me/index.php and at the top it says logout.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:51): and it says the url of the webid page.  \nbblfish - (14:51): http://nanoblog.me/ is better  \nbblfish - (14:51): because you don't have anything in your foaf profile on xwiki, it's not going to be very interesting  \nbblfish - (14:52): next to the logout button did it give your xwiki url?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:56): Yes.  \nbblfish - (14:57): ok, so you were logged in then  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:57): I just tracked the login process with firebug  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:57): Horrible abuse of the redirect :)  \nbblfish - (14:57): yes. foafssl.org is a hack, to help people get going  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:58): What I'm wondering about is the key which is passed to nanoblog. Who's key is that?  \nbblfish - (14:58): that is the signature of the URL  \nbblfish - (14:58): by foafssl.org  \nbblfish - (14:59): with a timestamp  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:59): Signed by foafssl.org's key I presume?  \nbblfish - (14:59): yes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:59): I see.  \nbblfish - (14:59): which is printed on the srv/idp page  \nbblfish - (15:00): well the publick key is there  \nbblfish - (15:00): the private key is on the server  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:00): While we're at it could we just put the whole thing into the auth code so there need not be the trust in foafssl.org?  \nbblfish - (15:00): yes of course  \nbblfish - (15:00): that would be step 2  \nbblfish - (15:00): the good thing about foafssl.org is I can do a quick test that way  \nbblfish - (15:01): then if you like it, you can roll it into auth  \nbblfish - (15:01): so I think writing a foaf+ssl login with foafssl.org is really simple  \nbblfish - (15:01): you could probably do it in less than a page of code  \nbblfish - (15:02): (depending on the lang of course)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:02): But you already have the code for foafssl.org written in java.  \nbblfish - (15:03): yes. setting up foafssl.org requires not just the java. It requires setting up xwiki with a client side cert  \nbblfish - (15:03): sorry  \nbblfish - (15:03): with a CA signed certificate  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:03): I see.  \nbblfish - (15:03): (otherwise they see warning signals)  \nbblfish - (15:03): also it requires some setup at the ssl layer  \nbblfish - (15:04): so it requires more work. I would do that only after we can show that the basic idea works  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:04): Right that very annoying FF page about self signed cert.  \nbblfish - (15:04): yes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:04): It didn't used to be that way.  \n92AAADNIF left #xwiki at 15:04  \nglerouge1 left at 15:04 (Quit: Leaving.  \nbblfish - (15:05): with Secure-DNS things will be a lot better  \nbblfish - (15:05): I think there will be no need for CAs anymore  \nbblfish - (15:05): and that is being rolled out right now in the US  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:05): Mmm, not really. You still have the ISP people (hi guys) and the NSA (hi guys)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:06): The potential for middlemanning the connection is still there.  \nbblfish - (15:06): yes, it'll take time. But long term the guy who broke X509 recently told me a few good ideas he had  \nbblfish - (15:07): Dan Kaminsky  \nbblfish - (15:07): he was in Berlin for Chaos communication congress at Xmas  \nbblfish - (15:08): his idea is that with secure DNS you can put your server certificate into the DNS  \nbblfish - (15:08): in a way, that proves the association  \nbblfish - (15:08): can't remember what the DNS naming system is called  \nbblfish - (15:09): but that's a bit of time off :-)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:09): ccc I seem to remember reading txt files by them back when txt files were big.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:10): DNS and CA's share the same shortcomings, centralization.  \nDV\\_\\_ left at 15:11 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nbblfish - (15:12): http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/wiki/Conference\\_Recordings  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:13): Still trying to figure out how we could put a full auth mechanism on each xwiki instance.  \nvmassol - (15:14): tmortagne: are we ready to upgrade myxwiki.org to the new 2.3-snap now?  \nvmassol - (15:14): also, are we ready for the 2.2.3 release?  \nbblfish - (15:14): ok, so I think by default you can allow foaf+ssl using foafssl.org, and then if people like it, we give them a README to set up the certificates etc  \ntmortagne - (15:14): upgrade: i think so i was about to start  \ntmortagne - (15:14): for 2.2.3 i need to look around but i don't know any remaining blocker  \nvmassol - (15:14): guys are we ready for 2.3M1 release too?  \nbblfish - (15:14): (you can put up foafssl.xwiki.org too  \nbblfish - (15:14): if you don't want to rely on me  \nvmassol - (15:15): has anca done her commits?  \nvmassol - (15:15): (ie is annotations working on trunk?)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:15): bblfish: I trust you :) but I don't like this 3rd party stuff  \nvmassol - (15:15): I guess we need a few days more to test it  \ntmortagne - (15:15): vmassol: did not seen anything related to annotation in notification but i could have missed it  \nbblfish - (15:16): CalebJamesDeLisl: yes, I don't like it either, it is just a stepping stone. Reduces the size of what is required to get going.  \nvmassol - (15:16): I don't think I've seen it either  \nvmassol - (15:16): hmm so 2.3M1 will get delayed a bit more I guess  \nvmassol - (15:16): we should define a new date  \nvmassol - (15:16): but anca isn't here  \nvmassol - (15:16): anyone else has stuff for 2.2.3 or 2.3M1?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:16): bblfish: I don't like the idea that the servers still need a CA cert when it's all done.  \nbblfish - (15:16): CalebJamesDeLisl: I like to do things step by step. It helps debugging.  \nbblfish - (15:17): Ah ok. To change that you need to change the way browser manufacturers work, and I think that is the next step  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:17): I wonder if firefox would let us sign eachother's keys :D  \nsdumitriu - (15:17): vmassol: There are always bugs to fix, but we have to draw a line  \nbblfish - (15:17): yes, we could do that  \nsdumitriu - (15:17): We can release a 2.2.4 in two weeks  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:18): bblfish: I don't suppose any CA would sign keys for us which can sign other keys.  \nbblfish - (15:18): you could do the same we do with clent side certts, by have an issue Alternative WebId  \nbblfish - (15:18): on the server cert  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:19): Now you're talkin'  \nbblfish - (15:19): but before you get people to understand that, they first have to understand the simple bit  \nbblfish - (15:19): we are doing now  \nbblfish - (15:19): when enough hackers grok that, we'll be hacking some good improvements into FF  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:20): So all your \"first step\" authenticator will need are the request parameters and foafssl.org's key?  \nbblfish - (15:21): yes  \nbblfish - (15:21): I should automate the key by publishing it  \nbblfish - (15:21): in rdf  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:21): And it should work through a portlet then.  \nvmassol - (15:21): sdumitriu: oh yes definitely, we shouldn't wait  \nbblfish - (15:21): i suppose I have not tried portlets  \nvmassol - (15:22): just asking if there were some regression/blocker still open  \nvmassol - (15:22): (for 2.2.3)  \nbblfish - (15:22): by the way the author of the GNU public licence, eben moglen's talk is clearly a huge call for the free software movement to start working on distributed social networks http://bit.ly/brQmJz  \nvmassol - (15:22): tmortagne: I think we're ready for the 2.2.3 release then \u00a0if the functional tests pass  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:22): If it \\*should\\* work through a portlet then I will write a request interface which extends portlet and servlet.  \nbblfish - (15:23): ok, cool :-) I think we even have some code to verify the signature in github  \nvmassol - (15:23): tmortagne: I have restested my demo with a snap on 2.2 branch from this morning and I don't have any exceptions anymore  \ntmortagne - (15:23): vmassol: i plan to upgrade myxwiki.org when hudson is done with the rebuild and test and release tomorrow morning 2.2.3  \ntmortagne - (15:23): ok cool  \nbblfish - (15:25): CalebJamesDeLisl: the test code is here I think http://github.com/bblfish/foafssl-java/blob/master/foafssl-identity-provider/src/test/java/net/java/dev/sommer/foafssl/login/ShortRedirectIdpServletTest.java  \nvmassol - (15:26): tmortagne: ok  \ntmortagne - (15:31): sdumitriu: you should maybe choose another example than \"wiki\" for http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ShortURLs since it's the default servlet mapping for path based multiwiki  \nsdumitriu - (15:32): Oh, forgot that  \nsdumitriu - (15:32): This might actually break things  \nsdumitriu - (15:34): It seems to work when virtualwiki or multipath is disabled  \nsdumitriu - (15:34): Well, /wiki/ is a decent name for the mapping  \nsdumitriu - (15:34): I'll add a warning  \ntmortagne - (15:35): jvelociter: what do we do about http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-615 ?  \ntmortagne - (15:36): sdumitriu: yes when it's disabled it should work well i think  \nsdumitriu - (15:37): tmortagne: Where is path based multiwiki documented?  \nsdumitriu - (15:37): I can't find it on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Virtualization  \njvelociter - (15:37): tmortagne: I fixed the import as backup pack for programmers  \njvelociter - (15:37): but indeed if guest is initially not a programmer that's not going to work  \ntmortagne - (15:38): sdumitriu: http://manager.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/AccessWiki and http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/URL+resolution  \njvelociter - (15:39): tmortagne: maybe ok for what you say in XWIKI-4073  \njvelociter - (15:39): (i.e. global admin instead of programming right)  \ntmortagne - (15:40): jvelociter: yes i don't see other solution  \njvelociter - (15:41): it does not fix the issue for farm mode, but that's another problem  \njvelociter - (15:41): (for local admins I mean)  \ntmortagne - (15:41): which issue ?  \njvelociter - (15:42): the fact that local admins will not be able to import as backup the XE XAR that needs programming rights  \ntmortagne - (15:42): well we can't do anything about that  \njvelociter - (15:42): yep  \njvelociter - (15:43): except some xar signing or other not trivial development  \nbblfish - (15:43): CalebJamesDeLisl: did you find out what your login problem was on webid?  \ntmortagne - (15:43): except of course not have any page tht needs programming right in XE standard but all that page are in jira alreasy think  \njvelociter - (15:43): first we should get rid of the need of prog right in the XE XAR  \ntmortagne - (15:43): yes  \njvelociter - (15:43): tmortagne: can you handle the fix in Package.java ?  \ntmortagne - (15:44): jvelociter: yes should not be too long  \njvelociter - (15:44): thanks  \ntmortagne - (15:46): the comment was already \"Determine if the user performing the installation is a farm admin\" ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:46): bblfish: I think it might be myxwiki cookie zone configuration.
