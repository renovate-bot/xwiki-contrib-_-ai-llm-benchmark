 \nmarta\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:20): anamarias\\_: 'a notion of \"friends\" between users' can be pretty easily implemented by defining an xwiki class and using xwiki objects attached to the user's page to express these relations  \nmarta\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:21): 'render render customized pages for each user' is possible  \ncypromis left at 14:22 ()  \nmarta\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:22): 'a way to matched installed applications to corresponding users' - sorry, i'm not sure i understand what you mean here  \nanamarias\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:23): a property, just like for \"friends\"  \nanamarias\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:23): but this one should say which applications each user has installed  \nmarta\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:24): ok, so i guess this is an easy one, too  \nanamarias\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:24): maybe some preferences for each of the applications too  \nmarta\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:25): so basically this is just some structured data you need to store for each user  \nanamarias\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:25): yes  \nanamarias\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:25): how about the activity stream ?  \nmarta\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:27): if this should be something like what is displayed in recent changes, then all you need is a query  \nanamarias\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:28): ah good  \nmarta\\_ - (11/05/2009 14:28): (and probably some formatting ;) )  \njumpkick left at 14:29 (\"Leaving.\")  \ncypromis joined #xwiki at 14:35  \ntachirei joined #xwiki at 14:58  \ntachirei left #xwiki at 14:59  \nglerouge - (11/05/2009 15:21): anamarias\\_ re the activity stream, as marta\\_ pointed it out you can pretty easily run a query to get all the latest modifications / activity done by an user and his / her friends. However that might not be the most effective appraoch when an user has many friends / a lot of activity (heavy queries running on the server)  \nglerouge - (11/05/2009 15:22): anamarias\\_ : an alternative would be to build upon XWiki's built-in activity stream service to create streams for each user  \nrrodriguez left at 15:22 ()  \nglerouge - (11/05/2009 15:22): then instead of running a query each time all you'd need to do would be to retrieve the user's stream  \nglerouge - (11/05/2009 15:23): anamarias\\_ : jvelociter should be able to tell you more about this way of doing things  \nanamarias\\_ - (11/05/2009 15:31): ok, thanks  \narunreddy joined #xwiki at 15:41  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 15:46): Hi arunreddy  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 15:46): Hi Sergiu..  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 15:47): how u  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 15:48): Sleepy  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 15:48): You?  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 15:50): am fine.tq  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:02): XWIKI-3468  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:02): Site odo.lv has several pages (documents) which are translated in 3 languages.  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:02): Document information tab shows several entries for the same document for each language for childrens and backlinks.   \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:03): What does the same document mean ?  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:05): sdumitriu: around?  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:05): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:05): Let me check something  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:06): ok  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:06): i opened the site. and the document information is same for a particular page in all the languages.  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:08): I think odo.lv already uses the fix, so it's normal that they don't expose the bug  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:09): is the issue fixed ?  \ntachirei joined #xwiki at 16:09  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:10): No  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:11): It offers a patch, but it's a raw one  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:11): It should be cleaned and tested  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:11): OK, so the problem is this:  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:12): ok  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:13): If you make the wiki multilingual (from Administration -> General -> Multilingual), then translate a document (Main.a) in 3 languages, each translation containing a link to Main.b, then when opening the Information tab for Main.b will show 3 backlinks from Main.a  \nsdumitriu - (11/05/2009 16:13): Only one would be enough  \narkub joined #xwiki at 16:13  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:13): ok  \narunreddy - (11/05/2009 16:23): sdumitriu: i have registered on the site. got a mail for validation.
