Is it ordered alphabetically or when the last change on a page was made? I only found this article http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/HierarchyMacro. Has anyone more information about that? Thx for helping me in advance.  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:31\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0@Evi, there\u2019s just the parent slot in pages insider there. Sorting is then left to the various macros.  \n11:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0You have question about some precise macro then?  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:41\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Hello XWiki experts, is there a model to follow when packaging an extensions that contains a xar and a java component? Thus far, I\u2019ve seen dependency-based methods. Is there a way to wrap it all in one archive?  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:49\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0@polx: ok, thx. So if I want to change the displayed order of the pages I have have to manipulate each makro..  \n11:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0what macro are you using?  \n11:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n11:53\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0Spaces Index  \n11:57\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0In the dashboad template, the space index lists all pages/documents in the space  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR, just got an issue again with link references in a wiki by a user  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for lestcastocdeurs.myxwiki.org  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically one user wanted to add a gadget to the dashboard  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so he added a gadget with a link like [[Notes des episodes>>Notes des episodes]] and this works when displayed on Main.WebHome but fails when displayed on Dashboard.WebHome (failed = creates a wanted link)  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using Notes des episodes.WebHome makes it work  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(\"Notes des episodes\" is a non terminal page)  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but using WebHome is complex and the user didn't know he had to use this...  \n12:02\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:09\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n12:39\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: that`s probably something that happened in the past as well  \n12:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I imagine that the dashboard gadget used an include macro instead of a display macro  \n12:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so it`s normal for the relative link to resolve relative to the place where it is used  \n12:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0polx: no, XWiki extensions should be installed with extension manager and it should be in charge of installing any additional dependencies that the extension may have (this includes other parts of the extension itself, like various jars)  \n12:51\u00a0<polx>\u00a0@Enygma, this means that the extension manager is the only way to distribute, right? Since otherwise, you\u2019d need to upload 3 (in my case) different extensions.  \n12:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:12\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:35\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0Is it possible to add a page to the quick link list? Or is it just for services like Sandbox  \n13:35\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: there's no include nor display. I guess it's how the resolving is done inside the Dashboard macro  \n13:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie the location metadata set by the macro probably  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whatever the cause, we need to fix this  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that it doesn't reproduce as is on master because Dashboard has been moved from Main.Dashoard to Dashboard.WebHome  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if you move it back, we still get the same problem  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I'm not sure I understand the logic  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you have [[something]] inside Dashboard.WebHome, how is it resolved?  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and why is it resolved differently if it's in Main.Dashboard?  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since I myself have issues explaining this, I can't imagine how complex it must be for our users ;))  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(something is pointing to something.WebHome in the example)  \n14:24\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:25\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:26\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: you don`t have anything in Dasbhoard.WebHome. The content of that page is just {{dashboard /}}  \n14:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it`s inside the gadgets that you can have stuff  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: forget the dashboard macro it's not th eproblem  \n14:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and in your case it was probably a basic text gadget (gadget object inside Dashboard.WebHome) with the content [[somePage]]  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I get the same behavior without the dashboard  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0So you an easily reproduce:  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* Create a top level nested page \"something\"  \n14:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0rendering [[A]] in page Main.WebHome will give you one result and redering [[A]] in SomethingElse.WebHome will give you a different result  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what I don't understad  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in my case it's Main.WebHome and Main.Dashboard  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/and/vs/  \n14:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, so A is a top level, non-terminal page  \n14:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and [[A]] inside Main.WebHome should resolve as the non-terminal sibling of Main, which is A.WebHome  \n14:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(after trying the children first)  \n14:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi\\_: You can edit the Quick Links panel  \n14:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so Main.A doesn't exist so it consider it not a relative ref but a full ref, i.e. A.WebHome  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now when [[A]] is in Main.Dashboard (Dashboard is a terminal page)  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would it try it as a children page?  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since it's terminal)  \n14:38\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0@Enygma: I'm in the edit mode of quick links panel. For Sandbox its \\* [[$services.localization.render('xe.panels.quicklinks.sandbox')>>Sandbox.WebHome]]. What do I have to put in if I want to add a Quick Link for the Site /Main/Wiki+Guide/?  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from the link I see, it resolves as Main.A.WebHome  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so basically the difference is that we have 2 levels (Main and Dashboard for Main.Dashboard vs 1 level only for Main.WebHome - WebHome doesn't count)....  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yuck, impossible to understand for users ;)  \n14:41\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: we explain it this way: relative links first try children and then try siblings  \n14:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for a terminal page, there is no children to try so we default to siblings directly, like we did before  \n14:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0just that now they are non-terminal siblings by default  \n14:52\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n14:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0on Main.WebHome, it was Main.A, Main.A.WebHome, A.WebHome (stop)... on Main.Dashboard it was Main.A, Main.A.WebHome (stop)  \n14:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi\\_: Check out the syntax guide for link syntax: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax?syntax=2.1&section=Links  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0autocomplete in wiki editor would help a lot actually  \n14:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0in your case, it would be [[Some Label You Want To Show>>Main.Wiki Guide]]  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(autocomplete for links)  \n14:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0he`s in inline edit now  \n14:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but still, yes  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I'm referring to my issue above ;)  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where the user couldn't create the proper link  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the end he's used the full URL....  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that was the only he could make it work  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*only way  \n14:58\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0Ok, thx. And I'm desperately trying to understand how the standard parent / child relation works in XWiki. When I add new pages it seems that they are sorted randomly. Not alphabetically nor when the last change on a page was made..  \n14:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: in your case he should have probable used either [[space:A]] or [[A.WebHome]] to refer the top level document absolutely, regardless of rendering context  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not possible Enygma`  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WebHome is not something he knows about and nor is \"space:\" prefix  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he tried for 10 minutes and then stopped  \n15:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi\\_: have you read http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/ContentOrganization ?  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically it's not possible unless you start reading the doc and take the time t understand several concepts which is not something casual users will do  \n15:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: it`s the price we pay for being relative by default  \n15:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I would prefer to be absolute by default and relative with some syntax... like [[.A]] instead  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, all I'm saying is that we need to quickly find a better solution for linking  \n15:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: can`t disagree :)  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n15:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0just that backwards compat was a big requirement and this is the result  \n15:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and I`m not sure how we can do anything about it without breaking backwards compat  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we were doing absolute by default before  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so not sure why you say that backward compat as a big req  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/as a/was a  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now ofc we need to handle the mess we created since 7.4 ;)  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(7.2 actually)  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma` is taling about considering a single element as absolute  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0single element always been relative  \n15:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0how is [[A]] from Main.X being resolved to Main.A, as we did before, absolute to you?  \n15:04\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0@Enygma: yes, I've read this, but this says nothing about the ordering. Like A - B - C - D or 1 - 2 -3. Which children is on top C or A, and why?  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, ok I see, I remember now  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a single element would not even mean anything before before a document has to be in a space  \n15:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi\\_: when viewing page trees, the pages are sorted by the page name (not by the page title). A page has a name (that is shown in the URL) and a title (that you can edit in edit mode). As a result, pages could \\*seem\\* unsorted when titles are not the same as the page name.  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(absolute single element I mean)  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0about tree and sorting we talking about moving to Solr for those which would fix performance issue and also rendered title sorting  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/talking/talked/  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only thing I can imagine is a new xwiki syntax  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like xwiki Syntax 2.2  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which would handle it differently  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the only valid way I can think of to not break backward compat  \n15:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi\\_: we have an issue for the document tree widget to come up with a solution for sorting by page title: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12832 but there are some technical issues that makes it more difficult than it would seem. Right now just know the difference between the page name and page title and that this is the reason for the apparent sorting issue in the tree. The pages are sorted, just that they are sorted by page name :)  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it would be absolute first  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/first/by default  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to start a mail thread about thi  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s  \n15:09\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n15:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: that sounds like a solution that would allows us to incrementally migrate to it  \n15:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0instead of breaking stuff  \n15:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0XWiki 2.1 is already abused enough with the recent changes :)  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but we would have incompatibilities when converting from 2.1 to 2.2 automatically  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why?  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n15:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since in 2.1- we don`t have the notion of relative links  \n15:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that we will introduce in 2.2  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it's resolved depending in the context?  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/in/of  \n15:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0one issue with this logic is that reference resolving does not have much to do with the syntaxe  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n15:11\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0ok, I understand the difference of page title and url. With what logic are the urls sorted? Like A, B, C?  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: sure but it means we would have several resolvers and that syntax would use one resolver  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's just an arbitrary choice for a syntaxe to choose its resolver)  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw this is what we do alreay  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have different resolves for wiki syntax 2.0 and 2.1  \n15:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi\\_: what do you mean by sorting URLs?  \n15:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not really  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not the same level  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the difference between 2.0 and 2.1 is the resource reference, not the way to understand a document reference  \n15:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi\\_: What you see in the URL /xwiki/bin/view/A/B/C is the location of the current page (C). The full location of page C is A.B.C (with the wiki being the root location for all pages)  \n15:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also it's not just the syntax, you have the same resolution in scripts and in macros  \n15:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's a good point. If they're not in sync that would be confusing  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the resolving of macro params representing references in not done by the syntax but by the macro....  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/in not/is not  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the resolving of the reference is not done by the syntaxe either right now :)  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even for link  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n15:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WikiModel does it  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all the syntaxe is doing is saying if a document resource reference and nothing more  \n15:21\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0@Enygma: I mean how the children are sorted in the page tree. When I have two children pages. \u00a0One url is \"A\" and second url is \"V\". If it is sorted alphabetically \"A\" should be on top of the tree, right? I hope you understand my question. Its hard to explain.  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we're stuck :)  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what makes it's very different from 2.0 vs 2.1  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there could be ways but it's not as simple as a new syntax  \n15:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it would need introducing namespacing for references and the question of the default namespace  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe what we are missing is a syntax to say absolute too  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[[/Notes des episode]]  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0space:xxxx is too hard to explain to a user since you need to explain the concept of space\u2026  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we create an alias for \"space:\"  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've been talking to the user (that's Emmanuel Bernard)  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he actually googled for our syntax  \n15:39\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he says that if he had know that the ref of the page was \"Notes des episodes.WebHome\" he could have succeeded  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw we have a bug in French on myxwiki.org for rename: https://www.evernote.com/l/AHcE7XisTB9MtqbtbLs2XD6LeqZ3Qgfaps0  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"RENOMMER AUSSI {0}{1} {1,CHOICE,0#ENFANT|1#ENFANT|1\"  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0any new syntax in the reference is a breakage in theory but [[/Notes des episode]] should not break too many people and it's indeed an easy one (still an easy one for technical people)  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we also need to define a syntax for \"parent\" so we could go fully the unix style and have . for current (which we already support), .. for parent and / for root  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt .. and / would break anyone  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could but it's marginal and it's probably acceptable  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/could/would probabmy  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like we would break 2 people in the world  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0probably not even  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm sure there are people who name some of their pages with a leading \"/\"  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I've seen some wild names ;))  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and \"\u2026\" is likely too  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ellipsis)  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone naming tech pages after a unix path would hit the issue for ex  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea/Enygma` (don't remember who coded the new rename ui): have you reused some existing translations keys for the new rename UI but using different parameters?  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see https://www.evernote.com/l/AHcE7XisTB9MtqbtbLs2XD6LeqZ3Qgfaps0  \n15:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: it's probably me who coded the new rename ui, but I don't remember about the translations, I'll have to check the code  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's likely it's broken for all translations now  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(except the English one)  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing another language  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no it's ok in spanish for example  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking l10n it's probably someone who translated the hint instead  \n16:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, maybe he messed up the choice syntax  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think he mixed up the hint and the label  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go in meeting right now, will check after unless someone beats me ;)  \n16:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: it's https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/12ec17d1c486935162581d47bbf1077693c401e6  \n16:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0core.rename.links.label used to have some parameters  \n16:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and it doesn't have them anymore  \n16:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0apparently I broke it.
