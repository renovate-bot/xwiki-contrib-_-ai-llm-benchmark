 \ncjdelisle - (12:18): The title for example is taken from the title field, run through #evaluate and then it ends up in the page.  \ntmortagne - (12:18): it depends how you defined your field i don't see what the user action has do do with it  \ncjdelisle - (12:18): Thus the title is evaluated as velocity then rendered as syntax.  \ntmortagne - (12:19): no it's not  \ntmortagne - (12:19): templates does not support wiki syntax  \ntmortagne - (12:19): and the title is not inserted into document content but in the UI  \ncjdelisle - (12:20): Hmm. no not that title.  \ncjdelisle - (12:20): <property>  \ncjdelisle - (12:20): <heading>$msg.get('core.register.title')</heading>  \ncjdelisle - (12:20): </property>  \ncjdelisle - (12:20): ^^ from RegistrationConfig.xml  \ncjdelisle - (12:21): Configurable has a line somewhere which says:  \ntmortagne - (12:21): ok but again as i said it only depends how you defined your fields  \ntmortagne - (12:21): if it's wiki syntax it's wiki syntax  \ntmortagne - (12:21): if it's not supposed to be wiki syntax then you don't use it the right way  \ncjdelisle - (12:21): = $obj.get('heading') =  \ncjdelisle - (12:22): err no.  \ncjdelisle - (12:22): = #evaluate($obj.get('heading')) =  \ncjdelisle - (12:22): that's it.  \ntmortagne - (12:22): for me  \ntmortagne - (12:22): = #evaluate($obj.get('heading')) =  \ntmortagne - (12:22): does not make any sense  \ncjdelisle - (12:22): The heading property is evaluated as velocity.  \ntmortagne - (12:22): either you use #evaluate and you escape the result either you don't use it  \ncjdelisle - (12:23): Then it goes into the page content and is eaten by the renderer.  \ntmortagne - (12:23): if it's a title i don't see why you allow wiki syntax in it  \ncjdelisle - (12:23): How would I prevent it?

(e.g. [[label>>whatever?queryString#anchor]] to [[label>>whatever||queryString=\"\u2026\" anchor=\"\u2026\"]]. That's for XWiki syntax 2.1 of course? If some of us agree here I'll send a vote  \nsdumitriu - (14:58): +1  \nvmassol - (14:58): the advantage is to remove any need for escaping in links  \nsdumitriu - (14:58): Actually not quite  \nsdumitriu - (14:58): If I think better about it, it means custom meaning for some parameters  \nsdumitriu - (14:59): What does anchor mean for a mailto link?  \nvmassol - (14:59): the params could be valid only for a given link type  \nvmassol - (14:59): and be ignored for others  \nsdumitriu - (14:59): How do users enter that in the WYSIWYG? You really think that they know what a QS is?  \nvmassol - (14:59): I don't think we have to give meanings to these params for all cases  \nvmassol - (15:00): sdumitriu: well how do they do that now?  \nsdumitriu - (15:00): They just paste the full link  \nvmassol - (15:00): nope  \nsdumitriu - (15:00): Which they copied  \nvmassol - (15:00): we're talking about link to documents  \nvmassol - (15:00): not urls  \nsdumitriu - (15:00): Only to documents?  \nvmassol - (15:00): urls would stay urls  \nsdumitriu - (15:00): OK then  \nsdumitriu - (15:01): Let me rethink  \nvmassol - (15:01): the cons is that it's a little bit longer to type  \nvmassol - (15:01): than before  \nvmassol - (15:01): but it's more semantically correct I think  \nvmassol - (15:01): s/semantically/syntactically/  \nvmassol - (15:02): (less magic)  \nvmassol - (15:02): we could even group queryString and anchor together as extraData or something neutral like this  \nsdumitriu - (15:02): OK, +1  \nvmassol - (15:03): we probably need to fine tune it so I'll send a proposal mail  \nsdumitriu - (15:03): mflorea: Try to change the color theme to \"Inner dark\" and then use the WYSIWYG. Can you do something about it?  \nvmassol - (15:11): proposal sent  \nvmassol - (15:11): sdumitriu: I call them parameters rather than queryString, makes it less technical and less related to URL  \nvmassol - (15:11): s/call/called/  \nvmassol - (15:12): if someone can think of a better name, it's most welcome  \nvmassol - (15:12): first we need to decide if that's what we want  \ntmortagne - (15:15): vmassol: big +1  \nmflorea - (15:27): sdumitriu: are you referring to the background color of the rich text area? It is forced to white on purpose.  \nsdumitriu - (15:28): OK, but the text color should be forced as well  \nsdumitriu - (15:28): Since that way it's white text on white background  \nvmassol - (15:30): tmortagne/sdumitriu/others: please reply to the proposal mail re queryString/anchor. I'm ready to continue the work I've started but I need to know what we want to do, so I'm a bit blocked by this FTM.  \nvmassol - (15:30): thanks  \ntmortagne - (15:30): vmassol: that's what i'm currently doing ;)  \nvmassol - (15:30): cool  \nvmassol - (15:30): :)  \nmflorea - (15:31): sdumitriu: maybe the best option is to use the content background color and the content text color (I suppose they exist) from the current theme in the RichTextArea.css  \nsdumitriu - (15:35): I remember there was a discussion about this some time ago  \nsdumitriu - (15:35): Maybe it was before color themes were introduced, so this information was not available  \nmflorea - (15:36): yes, it was before, and we talked about separating the rules that affect only the content from the skin and to include only them in wysiwyginput.vm  \nsdumitriu - (15:37): I guess now you can use the color theme information  \nmflorea - (15:37): yes, I can  \nmflorea - (15:38): so there is a variable for content background color and content text color, right?  \nsdumitriu - (15:38): Yes  \nmflorea - (15:38): great  \nsdumitriu - (15:38): You have to add something like:  \nsdumitriu - (15:39): #template('colorThemeInit.vm')  \nsdumitriu - (15:39): And then you have:  \nsdumitriu - (15:39): $theme.pageContentBackgroundColor  \nsdumitriu - (15:39): $theme.textColor  \nmflorea - (15:41): cool, let me do this change  \nnuvolari - (15:45): sdumitriu: pong  \nsdumitriu - (15:46): Hi nuvolari  \nsdumitriu - (15:46): Remember http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-542 ?  \nabusenius left at 15:46 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \nnuvolari - (15:47): sdumitriu: hmm, was quite some time ago, but I recall a little bit  \nsdumitriu - (15:47): Well, the idea is that it's an issue which should be resolved by tweaking the httpd configuration  \nsdumitriu - (15:48): Do you still have that problem?  \nr4tune joined #xwiki at 15:52  \nr4tune - (15:52): !search todo  \nr4tune - (15:53): which one of those is the best?  \nnuvolari - (15:53): sdumitriu: I will have to doublecheck for you.
