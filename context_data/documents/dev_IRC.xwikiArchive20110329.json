i think just using two more fields rather than dynamically determining what is present is fine  \n18:06\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0it might actually decrease the resource use, in comparison  \n18:06\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0at least from what i can imagine ;)  \n18:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure using pure object is a lot easier for the code  \n18:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but your idea was a little nicer for the user writing the page  \n18:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but object based can be done right now...  \n18:07\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0well, creating a new page the way i do it now requires to add an object, anyway, although it holds strictly numeric informaiton. so no trouble on translating  \n18:07\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0so i'd have the following fields in the object: category id, section id, min syntax, max syntax  \n18:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but that's a simple object you create at startup and don't touch much when modifying the page  \n18:08\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0well, that's a little more problematic then... because the min and max would have to be updated if necessary  \n18:09\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0i don't mind either, you make the call and tell me what action to take  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0good things with object is that you can search among them with a query without having to parse all the documents  \n18:09\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0yep  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you want to have a search based on section name in the UI for example  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or something like that  \n18:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0could be nice when there is a lot  \n18:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt|Notebook: new i'm not sure about translation stuff  \n18:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/new/now/  \n18:11\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0well, right now i would only have used the parsing for retrieving the cat name, the section name and include the specific contents for the specific revisions of the syntax  \n18:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what is min/max syntax exactly (you probably already said it but i don't remember) ?  \n18:11\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0cat name and section name can work with the current getSections  \n18:11\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0min syntax determines what the minimum syntax version is where this is displayed. e.g. the grouping section is not present in 1.0 syntax  \n18:12\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0max syntax determines the max version we wrote for that particular syntax  \n18:12\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0so if we have 2.1 selected but we only have something for 2.0 we reuse the 2.0 content in 2.1  \n18:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0wouldn't a list of version be better, maybe we can go back to some 2.0 syntax in 3.0 syntax compared to 2.1 ;)  \n18:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok probably not very common but it could probably happen  \n18:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0hmmmm, that would require lists for each section we would like to reuse...  \n18:14\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0that would be a lot of trouble to maintain  \n18:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0nevermind you have enough stuff to take care of right now  \n18:14\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0it would prolly just be easier to C&P the content into a new section  \n18:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0doon't listen to me  \n18:14\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0oh it's fine  \n18:16\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0so what do you say, rewrite the getSections (and other parts if neccessary) or just add two more fields and let them do the job and use getSections only for retrieving pretty names for sections and categories?  \n18:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt|Notebook: I would say if it's not too much work to do it with objects go the object way  \n18:17\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0okay, will do  \n18:17\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0it's really only something to worry about when extending a section page by another version section  \n18:18\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0PS: i have to consider some new wording :)  \n18:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0adding a quick getSection method could only be a bad designed quickly deprecated method APi when we have a good velocity target XDOM manager which is not very nice  \n18:18\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0okay  \n18:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which me need to to as quick as possible anyway  \n18:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we have more and more use case where we need to parse document content in velocity  \n18:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but the priority list is full of stuff like that :)  \n18:19\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0it's bound to be ;)  \n18:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in the meantime i'm fixing the javadoc\\*  \n18:21\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0HF ;)  \n18:24\u00a0<qwebirc37211>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:34\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: do you have 5 minutes ?

 \n18:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: sdumitriu and Marta told me it's okay.  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok what?  \n19:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0that the tutorial is ok  \n19:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well see my comment above  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's almost ok but it's lacking integration with current content  \n19:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok. I'll move it to DevGuide space and link it from there  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's \\*already\\* a page for that  \n19:01\u00a0<vladikoff>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so don't link it from the devguide space home  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we would confuse the user  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with 2 similar entries  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better to have only 1  \n19:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, so I should try a merge  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to modify http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/InternationalizingApplications  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to add a tutorial section in there  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ refactor it a bit IMO  \n19:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok.  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now the tutorial itself could stay on a separate page if you want  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or included inline  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0separate is probably best  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so reference information + tutorial on that page should be ok I think  \n19:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes. My point was to move the page outside of Drafts. In which space should I move the page ?  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh I thought you wanted to link it from the devguide space home  \n19:04\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes devguide space is a good space to move it to  \n19:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok. I will do that this week  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reading your tutorial  \n19:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok. I am going home, I will be back in 1h  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02 sec  \n19:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've read it  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it's a tutorial for the 3rd section of the http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/InternationalizingApplications doc only  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe not\u2026. anyway please do what you think it bsest  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can review after  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm probably wrong  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the tutorial is not about the 3rd section  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I got confused by the frist part of it  \n19:08\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it's a complete tutorial on how to translate. Not too technical IMO, it's for a regular user  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie the xclass/xobject creation which aren't about transaltions actually)  \n19:08\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well the xclass/xobject is not strictly necessary  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's already part of the faq tutorial  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's ok  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a bit confusing for me  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I understand the intent  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the real part about translation is only step4 actually)  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually you could have reused the FAQ tutorial and explained how to make it internationalized \u2026. ;)  \n19:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you wouldn't have had to explain how to create an app  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but since you alreayd have the tutorial done let's use it as is  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n19:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok :)  \n19:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so what's the conclusion ? :P  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have to go too, bb in 40mn  \n19:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay... talk laters  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0move it and refactor the i18n page  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to include/link to it  \n19:11\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we said  \n19:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:25\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0i want to get the name of a document i retrieved as a string  \n19:26\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0which function would i have to use?  \n19:26\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0because $sectionPage.substring(17) won't work  \n19:28\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0oh... nvm  \n19:28\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0checked the wrong bit of the java doc  \n19:30\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0hey I was writing my proposal for GSoC-2011 , i came across \"describe a tentative project architecture or an approach to it\" I am not too clear about what it means , I would be really thankful if someone could help me  \n19:32\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0supreet: Describe how you'd organize the project  \n19:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Major modules, used technologies  \n19:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0To do that well, you should understand a bit how XWiki works  \n19:34\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0do I need \u00a0to describe in detail how it would start and what all would be done in sequential order?  \n19:34\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0Thanx and I have been chatting up with evalica to understand how XWiki works \u00a0:) she has been a great help  \n19:35\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0:)  \n19:37\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0supreet: The level of detail should not be too much, since it will be a lot of effort put into something that might not be correct  \n19:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Mentors will see errors in the coarse description and will correct them  \n19:40\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0hmm okay :) so basically a short overview  \n19:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But at the same time it shouldn't be too shalow, since it could be interpreted as if you don't really know what you want to do  \n19:42\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0oh okay  \n19:52\u00a0<supreet>\u00a0sdumitriu: I ve been working and am interested in the project idea 'Mobile Skin for XWiki Enterprise' .

I started coding it  \n22:44\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0dependency injection ?  \n22:45\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0what is JSR330, anyway?  \n22:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://atinject.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/javax/inject/package-summary.html  \n22:46\u00a0<jstoldt|Notebook>\u00a0and wouldn't it be a good idea to put parts of the syntax guide in the cache macro? i imagine the way i create the map now is rather expensive. and unless somebody adds new sections or changes the language i doubt there is a need to process that on every request...  \n22:53\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: how much source code would need to be refactored in order to have JSR330 ?  \n22:53\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I mean which parts would have to be refactored ?  \n22:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: one class  \n22:53\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0which one ?  \n22:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ComponentDescriptorFactory  \n22:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's to implement support for it  \n22:54\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0so this means we won't use dependency injection core wide ?  \n22:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then we're going to slowly deprecate our own annotations, see  \n22:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://markmail.org/message/jiemhifhkkfsgii2  \n22:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n22:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0sburjan`: We are using dependency injection already  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's more than 1 class, there's another one for the @scope support  \n22:55\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0this topic is very advanced for me :)  \n22:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Just that it's triggered by our own custom annotation, not by a standard  \n22:55\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I see  \n22:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Every @Requirement is a dependency injection  \n22:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a good article on DI with CDI: http://java.dzone.com/articles/cdi-di-p1  \n22:56\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0so XWiki.java (the old monster) doesn't use injection ?  \n22:56\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has quit  \n22:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: corect  \n22:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correct  \n22:57\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I guess I'll have to look into annotations in order to better understand DI  \n22:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0annotations is not related to DI  \n22:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just one possible way to describe an injection point  \n22:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in xwiki land we were using an xml file to describe this a few years ago  \n22:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(before we moved to java 5 and annotations)  \n22:58\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I see only core devs voted on the thread, so I assume it's a little bit complicated for the people to understand (advanced java stuff)  \n23:03\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has quit  \n23:04\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0so this would only simplify our code ?

I am not familiar with them. Only thing I understand is that we'll use a standard instead of using our own  \n23:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's the only thing  \n23:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0The advantages of using it are:  \n23:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* Be standard  \n23:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no second bullet  \n23:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n23:08\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0:)  \n23:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0\\* maybe work with a bunch of more advanced DI controllers ?  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: yes that's the sub bullets points:  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*\\* Our components will be able to be re-used by injectors other than ours (Guice  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example)  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*\\* Since IDEs will support JSR330 they'll be able to offer features for our code  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(auto complete, graph, etc), for ex  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/dependency-injection/  \n23:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but till they standardize bindings too it won't be complete....  \n23:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0CDI is great but it's only Java EE.....  \n23:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: wdym only java ee ?  \n23:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not Java SE  \n23:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0do we use SE also ?  \n23:13\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I mean I guess we have plain java classes (no servlets).. so those are considered SE ?  \n23:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: yes if you take XWiki Commons for ex, it's only java SE  \n23:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: you can search the list for CDI if you want to know more.

This was a pain, because we were using the machine for multiple users.
