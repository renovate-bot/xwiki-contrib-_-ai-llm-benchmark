 \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0.children  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've tried [[.test]]  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it doesn't work  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it links to the sibling NP  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if it exists, didn't try if it doesn't exist)  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm right the parser cannot make the different between test and .test, .test.WebHome works  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but since that' what the syntax mean explicitely we need to fix it anyway  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0some special resolver might help  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm [[.test.WebHome]] doesn't work either  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are using snapshot or 7.4.1 ?
