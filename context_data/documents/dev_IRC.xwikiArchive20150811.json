Did I miss a bug in 7.0.1 ?  \n14:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: well maybe it doesn't work with Markdown ?  \n14:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok i'll just upgrade now and hope i don't break the wiki  \n14:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah you use markdown as wiki syntax ?  \n14:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0don't want you to look into things that are old  \n14:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0Document Syntax = Markdown 1.1  \n14:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but that should not make a difference to the generated HTML :-/  \n14:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I would have to try, markdown is disabled in my instances (because I never got around to enable it)  \n14:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it's the only reason we use xWiki  \n14:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0we were looking for a system to document our stuff that uses markdown  \n14:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: so the html says the following  \n14:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there is a \u00a0\"xwiki.section.edit=1\" \u00a0\u00a0in xwiki.cfg to disable section edit. I guess section edit does only work with syntax xwiki/2.x - totally misses the section limits in markdown, sorry  \n14:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0<span class=\"edit\\_section disabled\"><span title=\"This document's syntax doesn't support section editing!\"></span></span>  \n14:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0for each edit icon  \n14:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, thats why, then better disable it for now.  \n14:52\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yeah, it should in fact not show up ?  \n14:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0if i delete the span, the distance is OK  \n14:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I am sure it implementaion is done that way because someone thought only the old xwiki/1.0 syntax is a problem, so it rarely happens ... but one can easily argue for the opposite  \n14:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, then disabling section edit in the xwiki.cfg might even fix that problem  \n14:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0also the font size is 9px, which i also don't understand  \n14:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0um, yes that is not the normal layout  \n14:56\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0:S  \n14:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: it's actually 13px  \n14:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0my bad  \n15:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess 14px \\*should\\* be the default currently ... but anyway, does it look ok now ?  \n15:03\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: yep, i think it will be fine. i'll let you know after the reboot  \n15:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: i saved a document now and got a Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space  \n15:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0\u00a8:(  \n15:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0JAVA\\_OPTS=\"-mx2048m\" \u00a0at least \u00a0for production instances, i you ask me  \n15:08\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: this is my JAVA\\_OPTS=\"-Xms512m -Xmx4096m -XX:GCTimeRatio=2 -XX:ParallelGCThreads=8 -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 -Djava.awt.headless=true -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100 -XX:+DisableExplicitGC\"  \n15:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0erm, ok, that should be enough  \n15:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0duh, any stack trace ?  \n15:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yeah, but it vanished now as i reloaded the page  \n15:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0anything \"special\" about that page?  \n15:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0is it perhaps the \"autosave\" feature?  \n15:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0no it just contains some markdown, no macros  \n15:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah autosave is enabled for markdown ... but, nah, why should it.  \n15:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you just restartet the server, right ?  \n15:12\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0no, first wanted to save the document  \n15:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, and it bit the bucket when you pressed \"save\" ?  \n15:13\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yep  \n15:13\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0and when i hit reload with \"resend form data\" it worked  \n15:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe there is something in the log?
