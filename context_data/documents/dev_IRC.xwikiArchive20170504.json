As I can see on, XE 9.3.1 the default Admin profile is not hidden and the default groups are hidden. The new created users and groups are also created as not hidden. Is this the expected behavior or it's a bug that these pages are not created as hidden? Thanks!  \n10:47\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0Hi, I need to convert all page to language \"en\", so that the search function isn't multiple language  \n10:49\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0acotiuga: I don't think we want to hide user profile pages  \n10:49\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0regarding groups, I don't know  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0I confirm I see many users use the standard search to find users so we should not hide them  \n10:51\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:51\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0I guess for groups it's ok since it's more technical (not much information for basic users)  \n10:52\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0it could still be useful for normal users to find names of groups maybe when they search in searxh suggets f.ex  \n10:52\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0(since they don't have access to the groups ui)  \n10:52\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0now we could have a configuration about that since in some use case it does make sense to hide other users profiles I guess  \n10:52\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0but the default should still be not hidden  \n11:00\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Thanks for the answers.  \n11:18\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0Enygma: \"[WARNING] Rule violated for bundle xwiki-platform-refactoring-api: instructions covered ratio is 0.83, but expected minimum is 0.89\"  \n12:03\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:11\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n12:11\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0I have a problem with the search box suggesting when I type a word that I want this one to work in part (gif: https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcikU6LeeW6FI40/giphy.gif).

Does someone have any advice / indication ?  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0caubin: the extension index is stored in the permanent directory in <permdir>/extension/repository/  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0each extension is associated to a .xed file in which it's indicated where it's installed (or not installed)  \n16:10\u00a0<ClmentAubin[m]>\u00a0Ok, thanks !  \n16:55\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:15\u00a0<Nehagup\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:34\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<slayerjain>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:30\u00a0<slayerjain>\u00a0Got selected for gsoc 2017.
