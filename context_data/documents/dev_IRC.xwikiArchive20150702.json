And now I am talking with Marius about the functionality  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ramona\\_: document leve is ok that's the point of PE1/PE2  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but a nested dcument  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok good that you're talking with Marius  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*level  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0please check my second question too  \n11:40\u00a0<ramona\\_>\u00a0now i will try with a nested document and also with different levels  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ramona\\_: what about my second question?  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"btw I'm curious to know ramona\\_ whether you made the last change at http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/NestedSpaces?viewer=changes&amp;rev2=77.1\u00a0 or not  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not then it looks like a bug\"  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(precisely the removal of the space)  \n11:43\u00a0<ramona\\_>\u00a0i didn't do those changes  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks then it's a bug I think, I'll try to reproduce  \n11:43\u00a0<ramona\\_>\u00a0I only added Tested/Passed  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k thx  \n11:56\u00a0<ramona\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:56\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:57\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: hello again  \n12:05\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'm trying to test PE4 from http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/NestedSpaces on a 7.2-snap  \n12:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0but I'm unable to set as parent a nested doc for another nested doc  \n12:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0is this implemented?  \n12:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0from the UI at least I can't add new nested docs, so I have to do it by URL and try to change the parent manually  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: fyi created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-399 don't know if it's something we have seen already or not  \n12:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I'm trying to create the parent-child relation between multiple nested docs  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: the parent/child is deprecated and should not be used  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to create a nested doc, you can use the url or a velocity script  \n12:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0so basically most use cases from Permissions shouldn't even be tested?  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example: http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/A/B/C/WebHome  \n12:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0is this what you're saying?  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: yes they should  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they should be working  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure I understand what you mean  \n12:09\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok, let's keep it simple  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Nested space is a replacement for parent/child  \n12:09\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tell me how I can test PE4  \n12:09\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0step by step  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you create a nested space as I explained above  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you create some WebHomre, for example A.WebHome and set some permissions  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you then verify that the permissions you get on A.B.C.WebHome are inherited from A.WebHome  \n12:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok. so this should happen even if a.WebHome is not the parent of A.B.c.WebHome  \n12:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I thought the parent setting was a must for this test  \n12:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:32\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:04\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:04\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:21\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:26\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:26\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:40\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:47\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n14:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n15:19\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:36\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys plenty of red and yellow on http://ci.xwiki.org/  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to fix that since we have a release monday!  \n19:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has quit  \n23:12\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n23:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit\n"}
