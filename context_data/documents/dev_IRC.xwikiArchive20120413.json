I am working today to help testing 3.5.1 and 4.0. I will focus mostly on database migration  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: I talked to Silvia yesterday, you may want to have a quick status check with her  \n09:45\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0Silvia told me that postgres works on 3.5.1, but I wasn't able to properly migrate. She told me that I was skipping a step, I wil ltry again to reproduce  \n09:45\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I already had  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: you already discussed this with sdumitriu AFAIK  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIR you were simply using the wrong mapping file  \n09:46\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0sdumitriu committed a fix exactly last friday. I tested with that, but I was still unable to make it work.  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok, unfortunately I tried to get info from sdumitriu but he's not answering much :(  \n09:47\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e8a4d64dab1f2dfbce9fe70e24c0ca9166956f53 didn't do the trick, if this is what you're talking about  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:47\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but I wil lre-test today to make sure  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what I was talking about  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok we need to release 3.5.1 ASAP we're already very very late  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's become very urgent now  \n09:48\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:49\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes, I know. I am aware of it, this is why I tested 3.5 last friday. and I've had issues only with postgres  \n09:49\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0going to re-test all databases for 3.5.1  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:09\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n10:09\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:22\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<blackbird\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n10:59\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<CIA-120>\u00a0Vincent Massol\u000f master\u000f \\* r7a490bb\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/7a490bbb5824a1a0207e1085e81a43454b6e834b \u000f/ (7 files in 7 dirs):\u000f XCOMMONS-150: Move ComponentManager deprecated methods to Legacy modules ...  \n11:06\u00a0<CIA-120>\u00a0Vincent Massol\u000f master\u000f \\* r887e9bc\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/887e9bcf324606282e88e15df454331acc302159 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-component/xwiki-platform-component-multi/src/main/java/org/xwiki/component/internal/ContextComponentManager.java :\u000f XCOMMONS-150: Move ComponentManager deprecated methods to Legacy modules ...  \n11:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:12\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Hi, evalica, all what do you think of https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/44 ?  \n11:13\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0( XWIKI-7720 \u00a0)  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelo: hi  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you know if it's normal that we return only a single result in the JSON for a livetable even when there are multiple objects in a given doc for the class we're looking for?  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why not return them all?  \n11:14\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I think it was by design  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you know cases when we wouldn't want this? IMO this should be the default behavior  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and possiblty a flag to return only one result if there's a use case  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n11:15\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0yes that would be fine  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll dig a bit to see what it would mean to implement this  \n11:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it complexifies a bit and introduce the needs for programming right, but I guess that's OK  \n11:16\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0(unless the logic is ported to a backend function that bypass thePR, of course)  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n11:19\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:25\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0where should I report a small improvement in the Wiki Editor ? which is the proper component in platform ?  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0web module  \n11:32\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0mflorea, hi  \n11:33\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0just to let you know : the dynamic message tool of AWM doesn't work by default on a subwiki of XEM  \n11:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Hi jvelo  \n11:33\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0\"You don't have the rights to execute this script\" error  \n11:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it needs PR  \n11:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there are other pages that need PR too  \n11:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the class editor for instance  \n11:34\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0that's not an excuse ;)  \n11:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, I'm just given an explanation :)  \n11:35\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0anyway I don't understand why this dyn msg tool isn't done in java  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are way too many stuff done in wiki pages for usre  \n11:35\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0because it was easier/quicker to do it in groovy/velocity  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm looking at the livetable macros and they're a major pain to be in velocity scripts to  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: easier/quicker on the short run but that means increasing the tech debt  \n11:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, I'm aware of that, but when I wrote that code it had to be included in XE 3.3, so that was the only way, considering the available time  \n11:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7375  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as long as you're fixing it now it's ok ;)  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since 3.3 has been released a long time ago already  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, but in the mean time I was release manager and now I work on something else  \n11:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it's on the TODO list, but there were other thing more important  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's what I mean by tech debt, tech debt is always ok when it's managed (ie not out of control, it becomes an issue when it's unmanager)  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*unmanaged  \n11:39\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0mflorea, one thing you can do when you have several pages that need PR in an application is check for it and warn users  \n11:39\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0check out for example the code of https://github.com/jvelo/xwiki-reader/blob/master/src/main/resources/ReaderCode/OPMLImportSheet.xml  \n11:40\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0right now AWM fails quite in a ugly way in XEM  \n11:40\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it looks like it doesn't work  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when someone has to pay the tech debts of others, it's hard\u2026 which is what I'm seeing right now with the livetable code\u2026 yuck  \n11:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvelo: I'm not sure that all apps should do this. AWM pages that require PR have the RequiredRightClass objects attached and level set to programming, so you should know when you import the AWM in a sub wiki  \n11:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. this is a general problem, with any app that uses PR  \n11:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0e.g. with any XAR extension from e.x.o that needs PR, and you try to install it on a sub wiki  \n11:45\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0mflorea, yes it's a general problem I agree  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelo: I should be able to simple replace calls to $xwiki.searchDocuments by calls to the query manager  \n11:45\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0vmassol, anything has technical debt  \n11:46\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0as soon as you touch code your paying some and creating some ;)  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelo: if you're saying that everything has the same value I don't agree  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so putting everything in the same bad doesn't make sense to me  \n11:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvelo: does it work in Workspaces? if the page is saved by a global user that has PR (and workspaces have only global users)  \n11:46\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0no I'm not saying that  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/bad/bag/  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some stuff are in a much worse condition than other  \n11:47\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0sure  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and some people are refactoring their code while others aren't  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no magic  \n11:47\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but it's not so black/white  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as you say  \n11:47\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0for example debt varies with who looks at it  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some people keep the mess and others take the time to fix it  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't make it easier for them  \n11:48\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0sure, but what I mean is that the notion of \"fixed\" and of \"mess\" is relative  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's hard is fixing someone else' mess  \n11:48\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it can be fixed for you and not for me  \n11:48\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0etc.  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but we have a shared notion of common practices on this project  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm pretty sure we agree at 80% at least  \n11:49\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it's more subtle than just the practices  \n11:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0often by fixing something you alter the features  \n11:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it might be \"fixed\" in terms of technical elegance  \n11:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but it doesn't offer the same  \n11:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0etc  \n11:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0anyway I'm just playing the devil advocate as you'd say ;)  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I'm on livetable  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I find it so much a mess than I'm hesitating throwinf everything away  \n11:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0what part of the live table?  \n11:51\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0the velocity backend I guess  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I'm just looking at gridresult\\_buildRowsJSON  \n11:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and?  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has nothing to do in velocity as a start  \n11:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0(btw, it was a huge velocity macro before a split in it smaller ones)  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anything done in wiki page is just wrong  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0plain wrong  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you cannot debug it  \n11:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you can enhance it  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you cannot have unit tests  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't have syntax coloring, nor autocpmpletion  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nor can you refactor it easily  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I need to change  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0searchDocuments  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in favor of using xwql  \n11:53\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0vmassol, good luck with that  \n11:53\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0;)  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that's already hard  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to track down all calls by hand  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0navigate to different pages  \n11:54\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0you'll have to fix http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7273 first  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0etc  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7273 is the opposite as to why I wanted to use it ;)  \n11:55\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0aha  \n11:55\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it's a feature for you  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I was considering it a feature....  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I really don't think we should add distinct  \n11:55\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but the problem with XWIKI-7273 is not the objects  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that should be a filter  \n11:55\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it's the languages  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's useful to return several documents  \n11:56\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0not that often  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn' tmatter how often  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if there's only 1 use case it's enough  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we now have query filters  \n11:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0you'll make the 99% use the filter  \n11:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0it should then be the other way around  \n11:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0#occupyquery  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not us  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's SQL  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by default it returns all  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not the opposite  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have to add a filter to return only 1  \n11:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I'm thinking as a API consumer  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(distinct)  \n11:58\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0with your strategy for any trivial query, you will need 2 filters  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my strategy  \n11:58\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0query.addFilter(\"hidden\").addFilter(\"distinct\")  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to be able to construct the query in the future  \n11:58\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0because that's what you need most of the times  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nothing prevents us from having a layer that does this by default for those who need it  \n11:59\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0well filter should be able work the other way around too  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but hard coding a behavior is always bad  \n11:59\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0who talked about hard coding ?
