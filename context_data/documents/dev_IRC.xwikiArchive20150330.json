(like it's done in onImageEdit() in org.xwiki.gwt.wysiwyg.client.plugin.image.ImagePlugin, just without the need of selecting the image)  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found the reason  \n10:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:06\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:18\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:25\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0mflorea: Hi, i've got one question about GWT, I want to implement something like MacroController for Image plugin (i.e. you can edit the image with double-click without the need of selecting the image), i just have troubles crafting proper ImageConfig (since the image isn't selected, the code in ImagePlugin.onImageEdit() returns null)... any ideas how to obtain proper JSON image representation?  \n10:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: You could select the image on double click before calling onImageEdit()  \n10:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's quite easy to do this using the selection manager  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok blog test should work fine now  \n11:16\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0mflorea: thanks, something like this? http://pastebin.com/XbXGsDeP  \n11:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't understand this line:  \n11:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0s.selectAllChildren(doc.getParentNode());  \n11:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you need to check if the event target element is an image (img tag) and if so then select it  \n11:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0s.selectNode(image)  \n11:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(or something like that, I don't remember the exact API)  \n11:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0i.e. if the user has double clicked on an image then select that image element and trigger the edit image wizard  \n11:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n11:35\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0mflorea: okay, thanks, i will try to figure it out  \n11:43\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n12:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:30\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:13\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n14:38\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:33\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:48\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n16:39\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n16:46\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:01\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:15\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n17:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:04\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:14\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:15\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:02\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n20:11\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:42\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:22\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n21:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:59\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n23:12\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:27\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:33\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit\n"}
