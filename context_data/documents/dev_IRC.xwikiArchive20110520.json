 \n10:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0get another box connected or get someone to reset the existing ones.  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how will resetting the vm be enough?  \n10:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Once reset they need more swap space, they are dangerously underprovisioned  \n10:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0no the box is frozen :(  \n10:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0512M of swap --> out of memory + out of swap  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so tell me what we should have and I'll forward to our admins  \n10:21\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0At least as much swap as there is ram which is 2GB on one machine and 3GB on the other.  \n10:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0#2 it NEEDS an out of memory killer  \n10:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0looking for the exact name...  \n10:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://linux-mm.org/OOM\\_Killer  \n10:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It may well be functioning correctly but was not there for us because the swap space is so small.  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: ok an admin is looking at the agents now  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys is there an easy way to make a pull request from my cloned repo?

He added a test in the admin sheet to prevent admin section from being exported as PDF. The problem is that the export admin section uses the \"export\" action, and so nothing is generated.  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see....  \n11:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. the test he added thinks it is handling an export  \n11:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I reported it on the MTR already.  \n11:51\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: can you point me to a url saying that javadb is part of java6 (I can find lots of links pointing that it's part of \\*\\*Sun\\*\\*'s JDK 1.6  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0goolging  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0googling  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found that it's not in the JRE btw  \n13:05\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: admin says swap should now be o  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n13:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0great  \n13:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I have a little vps I setup on my desktop and I'm building platform in my own little hudson.  \n13:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If there is interest I could bring a small army of these in as slave nodes.  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: should we kill http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/186/console ?  \n13:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I've been looking at that.  \n13:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0swap is much better  \n13:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0this is odd.  \n13:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0agent 1 is idle  \n13:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0might aswell kill it then start it again and see where it freezes up.
