(I really thing this would be a feature) ... so the only way of changing the list of edit panels is by editing editpanelsvars.vm  \nStulle - (13:47): well, it would be a major improvement if the according settings were easily accessible and it wouldn't need a change of files in the .war or anything  \nrstavro - (13:48): s/thing/think  \nrstavro - (13:48): yep  \nsdumitriu - (13:55): Stulle: You don't need to change it in the filesystem, you can upload a modified version as an attachment to XWiki.DefaultSkin  \nsdumitriu - (13:55): And it will be in the database  \nStulle - (13:56): i was actually wondering about this feature. is it enough to just attach the file or do i have to make further alterations to the XWiki.DefaultSkin page to make it use the attachment rather than the filesystem one?  \nEnygma` left at 13:56 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nlucaa - (13:57): sdumitriu: hi, I noticed that there is a document save listener in the skinx extension for the save of a ssx with use global.
