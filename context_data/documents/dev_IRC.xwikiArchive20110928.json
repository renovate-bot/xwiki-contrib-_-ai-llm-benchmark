 \n14:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0actually I tough editor=inline was already there before mflorea latest changes  \n14:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but don't know very well what as been done for this particular subject  \n14:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: see http://tuska.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiAllGroup?editor=inline  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah edit, stupid me  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mixed up view and edit  \n14:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm does not seems to be the same thing actually in 3.1  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm not working for the main webhome though  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it does not really display inline mode as it should  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm on master)  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but myxwiki is beta so...  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0try on a page that really is supposed to be editable as inline maybe  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0like a group  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well the home page is supposed to be  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the dashboard  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0right  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe some pages need to be updated to not check the action anymore but the editor instead  \n14:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0probably missing some retro-compatibility stuff  \n14:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's not that easy since it's not correct to put inline as action if the action is actually edit  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we're suposed to be 100% backward compat  \n14:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0probably what happen on \u00a0http://tuska.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiAllGroup?editor=inline  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to fix this before the RC1  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a pity marius isn't here  \n14:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not sure how to \"fix\" it, the only way would be to force inline as context action which is not correct, all we can do is fixing the standard pages I think  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has marius mentioned he wasn't going to be present today?  \n14:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no idea  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok to put enforcer rule for JCL and Log4J in top level POM?  \n17:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yep  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok doing it  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's vicious because some modules in platform core were using JCL  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but they didn't decalre a dep on it, it was provided transitively  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I'm a bit afraid to perform the enforcer check transitively  \n17:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0enforcer can only look at pom.xml ? I tough it was possible to check java imports  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need a custom check that verifies that no code uses code from a non declared dep  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a maven plugin for that actually, I don't know if it can fail the build, I'll check  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0t's the dependncy plugin, the problem is probbaly the false negatives: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/examples/failing-the-build-on-dependency-analysis-warnings.html  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I sent a mail about this not too long ago  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could use the enforcer plugin to check transitively but we'll probably need a lot of excludes in this case...  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll explore a bit the options  \n18:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: hi, will you have some time to upgrade myxwiki.org to 3.2M3 today?  \n18:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Not today unfortunately, have company coming over.  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be real good to upgrade it to verify 2.3M3 works in a real life conditions so that we can fix stuff in RC1  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any volunteer?  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I would do it but I'd like to work on pushing our artifacts to maven central now)  \n18:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I might be able to do it tonight, if not tonight then tomorrow.  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys is it normal that if I do a: git checkout xwiki-commons-3.2-milestone-3  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I look at the pom.xml I see 3.2-SNAPSHOT and not 3.2-milestone-3  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Nope  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for miletone-2 it seems ok  \n18:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0indeed the tag is wrong  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: what happened?  \n18:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/blob/xwiki-commons-3.2-milestone-3/pom.xml  \n18:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No idea  \n18:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0missing a push ?  \n18:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The others seem correct  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: I wanted to build and deploy to sonatype's repo to stage for central but I need to be able to build 3.2M3  \n18:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes the others look correct  \n19:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The artifacts seem to be OK  \n19:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So maybe just the tag was wrong  \n19:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'll recreate the tag and push it  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unfortunately it's complex to push existing artifacts to central  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't found a way to do that  \n19:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(except 1 by 1 but that's too painful)  \n19:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you can't use deploy:deploy-file in a script ?  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's possible but it needs to be done for all files and for all artifacts  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for each artifact that's 8 files  \n19:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but you can find all those in a bash script using find or something and execute deploy:deploy-file for each  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how can I find them all?  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0based on groupId and version?  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from my local repo?  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what if I don't have them all in my local repo?  \n19:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Updated the tag  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if yo don't have them of course will be hard to send them but that's always true :)  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you could execute the script from maven.xwiki.org  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I build from a tag I know I have them all  \n19:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you would have better upload speed \u00a0anyway  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the only way to be sure  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maven.xwiki.org indee  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could try  \n19:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well if you get all the xwiki-commons\\*3.2-milestone-3 you should be sure you have all of them too  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would need my creds on there  \n19:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki-commons\\*3.2-milestone-3.\\*  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll try since I really think it's better to push already released artifacts  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to take me a lot more time than I had planned though ;)  \n19:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when you get something nice could be added to release process  \n19:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems maven is not installed on maven.xwiki.org  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: would be good to organize better the maven user home directory on maven.xwiki.org  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are lots of shell scripts lying around  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even a groovy one  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some jar like javax.jms.jar  \n19:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Removed the groovy one  \n19:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'd remove the ssh-agent\\*.sh ones since I made aliases  \n19:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think a directory hold them all would be good, wdyt?
