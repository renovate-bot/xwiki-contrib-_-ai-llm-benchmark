All other settings do. I'm only using the LDAP extension and install it using the web interface. I get it configured and working properly. Restart/reboot, the settings stay but the extension says not installed. Any ideas on a solution?  \n12:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm not sure but perhaps make sure your Permanent Directory (as configured in the xwiki.properties file) is not inside of a temp directory that is cleaned on startup.  \n12:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:22\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0cjd: xwiki.conf you mean?  \n12:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it might be inside of xwiki.cfg  \n12:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I don't remember properly  \n12:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0environment.permanentDirectory?  \n12:23\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0how can I check it's current value?  \n12:24\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0(running value)  \n12:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yup, that's the one, if nothing is set then it will use a directory inside of where xwiki is deployed  \n12:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so it depends on how you installed  \n12:25\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0manual war + jetty in /opt/jetty/webapps/xwiki  \n12:25\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0reverse proxy through apache  \n12:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0does XWiki have write access on /opt/jetty/webapps/xwiki ?  \n12:32\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0yes  \n12:32\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0permanent directory was commented out, with /var/local/xwiki which didn't exist  \n12:33\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0not sure what it was defaulting to. just uncommented. waiting for jetty to restart to test  \n12:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0uhh that's going to have side-effects  \n12:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well it seems that wherever it put your permanent dir was somewhere that was getting wiped each time anyway so maybe no problem  \n12:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0make sure that the user which tomcat is running under has write permission on /var/local/xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0jetty but yeah. xwiki isn't loading now. be back to report in a sec  \n12:37\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0thank you for your help  \n12:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh right indeed, jetty  \n12:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0IMO jetty is a better container than tomcat but that's just my personal opinion  \n12:38\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0seems easier to setup. lol  \n12:38\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0javax.servlet.UnavailableException: Cannot initialize RequestProcessor of class com.xpn.xwiki.web.XWikiRequestProcessor: java.lang.NullPointerException \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0at org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet.getRequestProcessor(ActionServlet.java:614)  \n12:38\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0is what i get hitting jetty directly  \n12:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0can you paste the entire stack trace to https://ncry.pt/ and put the link here ?

 \n12:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0just create the directory and give jetty permissions on it  \n12:46\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0or can i \\*start fresh\\* so to speak, my mods/changes should be in the DB?  \n12:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0some of them will be, extensions will not be  \n12:46\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0ok let me try that because it did also bitch about perms which i thought i gave  \n12:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but that's your problem already  \n12:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you're back today?

 \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: if it's a Maven project the release plugin does a bit more than creating a tag, it also set the right version before and update to next version SNAPSHOT after  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0two thing that may be a pain to do by hand when you have several modules  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if what bother you is Nexus validation I actually found out that there is a nexus release plugin that can automatically validate the release, just did not had time to setup that in https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/parent  \n15:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0what bothers me is mostly that I have to teach each person in my team about maven and then the flag to not require java6 and then they always have some problem with GPG and then if they're on windows (Yann is) there is another problem  \n15:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0What we could do is weed the version number out of the tag name and then fix it in all of the POMs before releasing and then garbage any of the tags created by maven release plugin  \n15:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if there's no obvious version number in the tag name or if anything else goes wrong, put the error in the page of the extension on e.x.o  \n15:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0this would make releasing an extension something that someone could do without this 1 hour training which seems to currently be mandatory  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are talking about making more painful each release so that the first one require a bit less documentation  \n15:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It's not just documentation, people don't expect things to require a page of documentation  \n15:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if they do, people just leave  \n15:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if you ever released something on npm, you know what we're up against  \n15:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: see my comment on XWIKI-12908  \n15:56\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: thanks for your comment  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: latest feedback could be interesting for you to have in mind: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/DownloadFormFeedback ;)  \n17:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed, that would be nice  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0solr 5.4.0 released btw  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(dunno if we should upgrade now or wait for 8.0 though)  \n17:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0would fix http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11633  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so could be interesting  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if not too dangerous)  \n17:34\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<Sputnikk23>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Ramona1: hi  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forget it :)  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0disabling ircbot to avoid some spamming  \n18:07\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: should be better now, pages generated by the githubstats app are hidden  \n18:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:52\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:16\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:21\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n22:57\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n23:01\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:07\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit\n"}
