 \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok \u00a0if it works only on the modile having the config then that explains it  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was running it on a downstream one  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since the one with the config is a pom one)  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so I can't run it  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0except by manually moving the config  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or temporaroly changing the packaging just to generate the xml  \n16:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying that  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no, not working either  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I copied the config to a jar packaging module  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and after running the mojo, the json is still there  \n16:46\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0c'mon! :)  \n16:49\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0that's not fair... I have integration tests for that! :)  \n16:51\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0vmassol: is the json config in the pom.xml or in a separate file?  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe ;)  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the pom.xml  \n16:53\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lkrejci: I edited xwiki-commons/xwiki-commons-core/xwiki-commons-component/xwiki-commons-component-api and copied the revapi config from xwiki-commons-core/pom.xml there  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I executed mvn clean revapi:convert-config-to-xml -N -e  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in xwiki-commons/xwiki-commons-core/xwiki-commons-component/xwiki-commons-component-api /)  \n16:55\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0Hi ! there is a way to force to include a doc (contains macros) on page in edit OBJECT mode ? vmassol mflorea  \n16:57\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i'm using macro to show my own displayer fields (custom display)  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ol-ow2: I don't understand. You have a textarea xproperty and you want to include some doc when that xproperty evaluates at rendering time?  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the custom display should include the doc then  \n17:00\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0My current custom display is : {{velocity}}#getInputText(){{/velocity}}, then it should be {{include reference=\"myMacrosPage\"//}{{velocity}}#getInputText(){{/velocity}}  \n17:00\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0right ? vmassol  \n17:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:01\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0and so for each custom displayer  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, with proper new lines between the macros  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:01\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok thanks  \n17:01\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0:)  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the alternative  \n17:02\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0yes ?  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that you put these velocity macros in macros.vm or another velocimacro for the skin, that's loaded at startup time  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0velocimacros are global macros  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0available from everywhere  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have some already in macros.vm  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but xwiki.properties can be configured to point to several velocimacro files  \n17:03\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0ok noticed :)  \n17:04\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0and.. another point  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's xwiki.cfg  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the property is xwiki.render.velocity.macrolist  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not specified it defaults to /templates/macros.vm  \n17:05\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0there is a difficulty to migrate xwiki 6.4.4 to xwiki 9.1 ?  \n17:05\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0farm to farm  \n17:05\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0or recommandation from you ?  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess the difficulty is nested pages  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's not a big ussue  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just need to understand what it means  \n17:06\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i've try a largeExport / import  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just need to read this page http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/ContentOrganization/#HMigratingtoNestedPages  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you shouldn't do that  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should let xwiki do the migration  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise you'll loose installed extensio,s activity stream, stats, etc  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Backup#HUsingtheXWikiExportfeature  \n17:11\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0thanks for these infos ;)  \n17:12\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0have a nice week-end ! :)  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0u2  \n17:12\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0thx  \n17:14\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0vmassol: the conversion silently barfs on comments in the JSON  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me try to remove them  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm same problem  \n17:24\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:28\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n20:20\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:21\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:26\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0has quit\n"}
