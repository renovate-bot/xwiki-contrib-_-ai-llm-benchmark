 \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks nice overall \u2026 some content bugs  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be nice if clicking in the menu didn't refresh the whole page  \n10:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think that won't be possible  \n10:48\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0not with the code of the admin app  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case it's already very nice  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it maintainable?  \n10:48\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0thanks  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the content)  \n10:48\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i tried to make it maintainable  \n10:49\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0this is actually something i'd like to discuss with you  \n10:49\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it probably best if i explain what i did  \n10:49\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so the layout is this, the XWikiSyntax is just the page that puts together all the content.  \n10:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it generates the navigation items and headings for the content  \n10:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0each sections content is stored on a single page  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so one page per section content  \n10:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and each of those pages has a level 5 heading that holds information about the version  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0exactly  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is a section?  \n10:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so for instance for the links i got three sections, \"10\", \"20\" and \"21\"  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"editing\" ?  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or \"paragraphs\"  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0nope, Paragraphs  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0editing is a category  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0a nice thing could maybe be to make it a bit more dynamic and make XWikiSyntax discover the sections pages based on an xclass  \n10:52\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anyway, the three sections within a content page are used to include the content for the proper syntax version  \n10:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0within the content map (in code at the beginning) i got some markers that tell the code when the section should be available or if the section for a previous version should be loaded  \n10:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0tmortagne: i would have like that  \n10:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but somebody said that would require PR  \n10:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why ?  \n10:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0and i didn't want to go to those extents for the Syntax page  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can search document with a xclass based where clause  \n10:55\u00a0<xipe>\u00a0has quit  \n10:55\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that would be nice to have because then i could remove the information from the map and add it dynamically  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's one of the most commons request used in XE (getting the list of panels, users, etc..) and it does not need PR  \n10:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0oh  \n10:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the section pages  \n10:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0my bad  \n10:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i thought you said sections  \n10:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n10:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what is the difference ?  \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0let me reread what you said  \n10:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0XWikiSyntaxNew > Category (virtual entity) > Section page (XWikiSyntaxParagraphs page) > Sections (===== 10 ===== or ===== 20 ===== or ===== 21 ===== headings that will be included into XWikiSyntaxNew)  \n10:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i understood \"each sections content is stored on a single page\" as one section being one page  \n10:59\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0content wise one page holds one section but from the wording one page can hold multiple sections that represent different revisions of content  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to start upgrade of myxwiki.org to 3.0RC1  \n11:00\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that will be nice! then i can work there or something  \n11:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt: anyway i need to look at details but if you have read right on pages you should be able to do something dynamic without PR  \n11:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: same comment than vmassol on the two columns  \n11:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/vmassol:/jstoldt:/  \n11:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the question is if i can figure out which sections (i.e. which headings) exist on the Section page  \n11:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it looks nice :)  \n11:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0jstoldt: depends how section are stored in a page  \n11:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because without the information for what to look for the code won't work as it works now and we would need more redundancy  \n11:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0can't youhave only one section by page ? would be too overkill ?  \n11:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like i said, a level 5 heading that reads either 10, 20 or 21 (according to version) and after that the displayed content  \n11:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0right now i am just hiding the h5 headings  \n11:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or you mean subsections ?

I'm worried that adding {{signed}} will cause a proliferation of PR code everywhere because it will become much easier to do.  \n17:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: it's not an API issue, there is all needed API in this case  \n17:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but not anyone case use API which does dangerous things like installing a jar  \n17:11\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0So does that mean the extension manager can be tricked with an {{include}} macro to add jars for anyone?  \n17:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: no since you need to include a page which have programing right  \n17:12\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Sure but can't anyone include that page?  \n17:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes but this page does not allow anyone to use click on the button  \n17:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/use//  \n17:13\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0So it checks for admin permission on the viewer?  \n17:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n17:13\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0But an API can also do the same.  \n17:14\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0What I would have done is use a groovy script to add a script service to $services which does the check and adds the jar when asked.  \n17:14\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0then {{include}} the page with the groovy script.  \n17:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: there is a service, i don't understand what groovy as to do with that\u00a7  \n17:15\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Well, the part which needs PR can add a script service so that it can be called by the part which is sandboxed.  \n17:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you don't require programming right on the page author anyone can call the API and wait for an admin to access the page  \n17:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not all about the viewer  \n17:16\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Sure but why not use a save() trap then.  \n17:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0plus without PR i don't see how you expect to execute groovy...  \n17:17\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0The included page can have PR right/  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0apache starts using git: http://git.apache.org/  \n17:18\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Anyway, I'd like to change that issue from a bug to a feature request since I don't think there is any documentation anywhere on Configurables with PR.  \n17:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's more on improvment than a new feature request IMO  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's not a feature request for me, improvement is ok  \n17:19\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't agree but I suppose it's an acceptable compromise.  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw on XE 3.0 we have 42 new features listed but I doubt that they're all features  \n17:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a042 sounds a lot indeed  \n17:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but 42 is always a good sign :)  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=%28project+in+%28XWIKI%29+AND+fixVersion+in+%28%223.0+M1%22%2C+%223.0+M2%22%2C+%223.0+M3%22%2C+%223.0+RC1%22%29+AND+resolution+in+%28Fixed%29+OR+project+in+%28XE%29+AND+fixVersion+in+%28%223.0+M1%22%2C+%223.0+M2%22%2C+%223.0+M3%22%2C+%223.0+RC1%22%29+AND+resolution+in+%28Fixed%29+OR+project+in+%28XTPACKAGER%29+AND+fixVersion+in+%28%221.16%22%2C+%221.17%22%29+AND+re  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice url  \n17:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like IRC cut part of it, does not work for me  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me tinyurl it  \n17:22\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0\"That's a regression: this was fixed at some point and broken again it seems.\"  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://tinyurl.com/4ja2dnl  \n17:22\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't see how it would have but if it did then it was a security vuln.  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've never really defined what we mean by feature vs improvement  \n17:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: if that was a regression I would not accept it to be just tagged as \"improvment\", remove that line if you like  \n17:24\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0If it did work at one point then I would like to know about it.

(maven allows that)  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but doing these kinds of things makes page fragile too  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since they dpeend on external systems  \n18:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0extension manager does not have version range in the API yet but it's possible to do that with aether directly  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't use aether  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would need some example  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to try generating the jira JQL for listing all issues in a release but I don't know if it's easy or not with aether directly  \n18:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I did not tried this particular use case with aether myself yet but as far as i can see it's about creating a VersionRangeRequest (or a name like that), execute it and get the result in the returned object  \n18:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so more or less 3 lines of code  \n18:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0plus the sets on the request object  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what about reading pom.xml?  \n18:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0depends what you need in the pom  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's using maven itself or aether does it?  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for extracting the deps  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it used to be in maven when I last used that)  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if it's dependency management plumbing aether will give it to you  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0for all the rest you need to parse it with maven API  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0transitive deps I mean  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you give it a GAV and it returns a list of transitive deps  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the request will give you an Artifact object which contains all informations you need  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0dependencies etx  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0etc  \n18:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0very easy to read  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0transitive ones?  \n18:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0nop you have to do that recursively i think  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so using maven  \n18:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but there is maybe some helper i did not seen yet since I did not need it  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maven core can do that  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it used to)  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is better than looping as otherwise you have to implement the same logic, understand scopes, etc  \n18:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: since maven is using aether for this logic i'm pretty sure there is all your need in aether  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be in maven  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(probably is)  \n18:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0aether is supposed to be what is taking care of all dependency resolution work in maven 3  \n18:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0transitive dependencies included i'm sure  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: so in the extension manager you're looping to find the transitive deps?  \n18:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're taking care of scopes?  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I guess so)  \n18:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n18:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i can't let aether take care of that since in extension manager generic logic each dependency can comes from any repository and their are not supposed to be all maven stuff only  \n18:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0plus it's not a build so the logic is a bit different  \n18:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0for example provided scope is taken by extension manager  \n18:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: should be ok i think  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks good thanks  \n18:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: note that I did not put the xhtml syntax in the pom.xml examples, don't think we need to put all since it's explain at the top of the page where to find what  \n18:53\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok i see you've put it in the standalone jar cool  \n18:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n18:56\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0is this the proper form for questions are not development related  \n18:56\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0\\*forum\\*  \n18:57\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbc581: yes here or on the forum/mailing list, see dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/MailingLists  \n18:59\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n19:01\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0heh r27837 I did change the registration page. I just changed the wrong entry.  \n19:02\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0my question is recording the annotation functionality and the you scribo. I would like to develop an application where by I can cross reference security vulnerabilities published by nist (CVS repository) against a list of applications we have in our environment. do I need to create an ontology to load the CVS from XML properly  \n19:02\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0interesting application  \n19:03\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0so you need to parse xml?  \n19:03\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0yes I have urgent need to represent things in semantic form  \n19:04\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0by semantic you mean RDF?  \n19:04\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm. must have scared him away.  \n19:05\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:06\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0by semantic you mean RDF?  \n19:07\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0I suppose that would be the route to go. using rdf might be complicated for me. I am still trying to gain experience  \n19:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:08\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I think your code will need to run with programming permission, is that ok for what you are doing?  \n19:08\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0it might be necessary for me to reach out to Fabio directly. would this be considered rude?  \n19:08\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0I should facilitate if necessary. could this not be done with velocity or groovy?  \n19:09\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0re rude: I don't think so.  \n19:09\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0It can definitely be done with groovy.  \n19:10\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0I wish I knew more about scribo but I suppose I can look for some groovy programming resources  \n19:12\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0scribo as in the LaTeX editor?  \n19:12\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0As far as groovy, it's almost exactly the same as java, So much so that you can often copy/paste java examples from the web into groovy macros.  \n19:13\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0I suppose the main difficulty will be to put something together for my company before they attempt some of the shelf commercial package instead. by scribo I mean the annotation framework. I think the URL is www.scribo.ws  \n19:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0bbc581: you should probably details your use case on the mailing list instead of IRC, Fabio will probably answer to it there when he have time or someone else (plus could be useful for others too since it's easier to find stuff on mailing list archive than IRC)  \n19:16\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:19\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:20\u00a0<bbc5812>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:20\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<bbc5812>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:35\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:49\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n19:51\u00a0<cpels>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:53\u00a0<mayanks431>\u00a0has quit  \n19:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:34\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:26\u00a0<mayanks431>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:29\u00a0<mayanks43>\u00a0has quit  \n21:32\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:02\u00a0<harshanianu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:04\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I think I'd like to fix XWIKI-6170 by caching a document \"pointer\" which has 2 fields, one is a document and the other is a string.  \n22:05\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0So when the requested key is not the same as the document's key, the it stores null for the document field and the \"real\" key for the string field.  \n22:06\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0I thought about fixing it by making sure the key is always the same but that is more complex, IE it relies on more code being right in order for it to work.  \n22:07\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0Any thoughts?
