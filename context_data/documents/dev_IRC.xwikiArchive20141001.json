 \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:13\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, what could be causing issues that prototype cannot load elements by class? \u00a0$('.bottombuttons') doesn't find anything (although jQuery('.bottombuttons') can), this issue is affecting AWM and possibly other pages (for example user cannot be edited now, due to similar problem)  \n12:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0got it, $ is alias for document.getElementById  \n12:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: with prototype: $$('.myClass')  \n12:27\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0gdelhumeau: yup, that sadly doesn't solve my issue... in AWM step 2, $('inline').down('.bottombuttons') returns undefined  \n12:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I think you should use: http://api.prototypejs.org/dom/Element/prototype/select/  \n12:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0(and even better, drop Prototype and use jQuery instead if you can)  \n12:30\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0that javascript is taken from AppWithinMinutes.WizardStep jsx, so i could use jquery, but i would have to rewrite whole awm  \n12:32\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0this is the whole loaded dom, no other issues according to js console (all files should be loaded properly), http://pastebin.com/LQZCE7Ep  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:23\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ok, solved, it was created by template modifications (moving quicksearch to content body)  \n13:28\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0gdelhumeau: any ideas, why form element in #contentmenu breaks prototype?  \n13:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it breaks it?  \n13:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:31\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0well, try <div id=\"contentmenu\" class=\"pull-right actionmenu\"><form></form> \u00a0(or any valid form element) in menus\\_content.vm and some functionality gets broken (for example step 2 in AWM or editing user profile, so maybe only inline edit is broken)  \n13:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0can you give me an example of what is broken ?
