 \nsdumitriu - (15:12): This is why we have http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/444307267  \nvmassol - (15:12): I'm not sure  \nsdumitriu - (15:12): So your question actually is: won't characters that can't actually be placed in the content be displayed wrong?

Maybe it's something related to tags.  \nvmassol - (15:46): sburjan: you have a screenshot of what doesn't work? Have you tried the tag cloud on 2.6 with IE7?  \ntmortagne - (15:46): jstoldt: i don't think so, macro description are strongly linked to the macro, either plain string a a field or a translation for not way to make it look like elsewhere dynamically AFAIK  \ntmortagne - (15:47): s/for not/but no/  \nsburjan - (15:47): vmassol: uploading screenshot  \njstoldt - (15:47): pitty but okay, i'll just C&P the strings from the language file then...  \ntmortagne - (15:48): we plan to support variables in translations at some point but it's not top of the todo list  \njstoldt - (15:48): cool :)  \nsburjan - (15:50): vmassol: http://img121.imageshack.us/i/extensionslivetable.png/  \nsburjan - (15:50): Tag Cloud works on 2.6 with IE 7  \nvmassol - (15:52): sburjan: seems you've clicked on the tag cloud in the screenshot  \nvmassol - (15:52): can you try without clicking in the tag?  \nvmassol - (15:53): the image looks ok, it simply shows no match  \nvmassol - (15:53): ah not quite 1-30 of 30  \nsburjan - (15:53): vmassol: I didn't click on the tag cloud. I just selected Type -> Plugin  \nvmassol - (15:54): anyway I'm not the right person to help here  \nvmassol - (15:54): IMO this needs to be raised in jira  \nvmassol - (15:54): and jerome is the person to ping  \nsburjan - (15:55): but I tested on 2.6 on IE7, and tab cloud works, Livetables work. I guess what we have on Extensions is something custom. Don't you think ?  \nmbryant - (15:55): vmassol: hey quick question who do I need to talk to about the format date of a date property. I need to know if I can use the full ISO 8601 format  \nvmassol - (15:55): no  \nvmassol - (15:56): (that's for sburjan)  \nvmassol - (15:56): I bet you haven't tested the samre thing  \nvmassol - (15:56): did you test with a select field?  \nvmassol - (15:56): with the same data?  \nvmassol - (15:56): there's nothing custom on xwiki.org  \njstoldt - (15:56): how would i compare two strings in groovy? i want to see if a given parameter has been filled and says \"true\"  \nvmassol - (15:57): mbryant: you can set the date format to anything AFAIK  \nvmassol - (15:57): mbryant: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HDateformat  \nmbryant - (15:58): vmassol: thank you thats exactly what I needed I appreciate it  \ntmortagne - (16:14): sdumitriu: working on org.xwiki.extension.repository.DefaultExtensionManagerTest.testInstallAndUninstallExtension  \nsdumitriu - (16:14): tmortagne: How long will that take?  \nsdumitriu - (16:14): I'm looking at XML encoding  \ntmortagne - (16:15): no idea yet, does not looks like directly related to extension manager but i guess it's not very big, in any case it's a test issue IMO  \ntmortagne - (16:17): according to the error, some module is referencing org.xwiki.rendering.internal.parser.GenericLinkParser in its component.txt which does not exists anymore  \ntmortagne - (16:17): vmassol: any idea ?  \nvmassol - (16:19): tmortagne: doesn't ring a bell  \ntmortagne - (16:21): ha i think i know  \ntmortagne - (16:22): it's not excatly 2.7-SNAPSHOT issue but extension manager is trying to install ruby macro 2.4 which is broken by link related changes made  \njstoldt - (16:24): could something like this work: if (xcontext.macro.params.openin && xcontext.macro.params.openin == \"true\")  \njstoldt - (16:24): ???  \njstoldt - (16:25): disregard that... stupid me is too stupid to type proper name of the param -.-  \ntmortagne - (16:26): jstoldt: not a groovy expert but in java the == would not be enough (you would have to use xcontext.macro.params.openin.equals(\"true\"))  \ntmortagne - (16:26): but sine == is enough in velocity it's probably true for groovy too i guess  \njstoldt - (16:26): yeah, using the proper param name does the trick...  \ntmortagne - (16:26): ok  \ntmortagne - (16:27): answered before before i see you last message ;)  \njstoldt - (16:27): haha, still nice you answered.  \njstoldt - (16:28): well, usually i agree that using a compare function would be nicer  \njstoldt - (16:28): but since i am actually only checking for true with no variation it should be fine  \njstoldt - (16:28): and i think i like groovy better than velocity. seems more c++'ish to me X-D  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): mflorea: \"Failed to parse /document-formats.js\"  \nmflorea - (16:30): sdumitriu: when/where?  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Test/27snapshots#HOfficeImporter  \nsdumitriu - (16:31): Ask sburjan for details  \nmflorea - (16:32): ok  \njstoldt - (16:34): how would i go about uploading a new version of a macro? just export it as xar and upload it to the appropriate page?  \ntmortagne - (16:36): jstoldt: upload where ?  \njstoldt - (16:36): i prepared an enhanced version of the Windows Path macro  \njstoldt - (16:36): so i'd just attach it to that page  \nvmassol - (16:37): hmm that shows we need instructions  \nvmassol - (16:37): on extensions.xwiki.org  \njstoldt - (16:37): that'd be neat  \nvmassol - (16:37): Adding it now  \njstoldt - (16:38): cool  \nsburjan - (16:39): mflorea: \u00a0yes, so the OO path is correctly set, the OO server starts, but I get that error in console  \njstoldt - (16:40): sburjan: latest 3.3 beta of OO.o?  \njstoldt - (16:40): because i tried that one and i got errors and eventually switched to LibO  \nMenso joined #xwiki at 16:41  \nsburjan - (16:46): It doesn't matter the version of OO. I have the default that came with ubuntu 10.04  \njstoldt - (16:47): i see  \njstoldt - (16:48): when replacing the screenshots, should i use .gif to make a new attachment version or could i use .png to create entirely new pictures?  \ntmortagne - (16:49): sdumitriu: i think i found what is the issue, should not take long  \nvmassol - (16:49): jstoldt: is it any better now?  \nsburjan - (16:49): jstoldt: use png or jpeg please  \nvmassol - (16:50): jstoldt: always png  \nvmassol - (16:50): (gif is proprietary)  \njstoldt - (16:50): great. should i remove the gifs then?  \nsburjan - (16:50): so rules is set :)  \nsburjan - (16:50): jstoldt: only if you re-create them as png's :)  \nvmassol - (16:50): jstoldt: let me know if instructions are better  \njstoldt - (16:51): i created new ones with new content  \ntmortagne - (16:51): (sdumitriu: basically this is caused by http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view\\_bug.do?bug\\_id=4273532)  \nvmassol - (16:51): jstoldt: as a user is it ok to understand that you need to click on the edit button to make a change to the page?  \njstoldt - (16:51): vmassol: i'll just finish editing and then check your explanation  \njstoldt - (16:53): could somebody just check the macro and see if i met the requirements?  \nsburjan - (16:53): jstoldt: This could help you if you want to help with documentation. \u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DocGuide#HScreenshots2FImages  \njstoldt - (16:53): and also possibly delete the old .gif's?  \nsburjan - (16:54): jstoldt: if the screenshot was re-created as png, yes.  \njstoldt - (16:54): okay  \nMenso - (16:54): Was there a conscious decision made not to have newly created pages be children of whatever page the user is viewing when he its \"create page\" ?  \nsburjan - (16:54): I am going home. See you later guys  \nvmassol - (16:55): jstoldt: use a comma to separate contributors  \nvmassol - (16:55): I'm adding doc for this too  \ntmortagne - (16:55): sdumitriu: fixed, wommitting in 10 sec  \ntmortagne - (16:55): s/wommitting/committing/  \nMenso - (16:55): better than vommiting :-)  \ntmortagne - (16:56): sure :)  \nsburjan left at 16:56 (Quit: Ex-Chat  \ntmortagne - (16:58): done  \njstoldt - (16:58): okay, i think i'm done.  \nvmassol - (16:58): btw jstoldt I wonder if the new unc prefix will work for your use case  \njstoldt - (16:58): huh?  \nvmassol - (16:59): XWIKI-193  \njstoldt - (17:00): oh, yeah, well, although it would be nice i don't think it needs the requirements here  \njstoldt - (17:00): i basically just added the windows path macro for my colleagues who have no clue about all the computer stuff  \njstoldt - (17:00): so they can easily make alink from a given directory path  \njstoldt - (17:01): they all got the same network shares as drives on their machines anyway, so it will work for anyone that is actually conerned by this  \nvmassol - (17:02): jstoldt: hmmm ok so what you're saying is that we need a UI for it in the wysiwyg editor now  \nvmassol - (17:02): mflorea: that's a good point  \nvmassol - (17:02): the wysiwyg editor might need some support for the new link/image types  \nvmassol - (17:02): mflorea: doc:, path:, unc:, icon:, the future user:  \njstoldt - (17:02): yeah, that is pretty much the ghist of what i am saying  \njstoldt - (17:02): i don't know about other companies but in this particular one the major requirement is \"MAKE IT EASY, MAN!\"  \njstoldt - (17:03): so best would actually be to create file:/// links via the WYSIWYG editor by choosing a file  \njstoldt - (17:04): but not uploading it, obviously  \nMenso - (17:04): that would only work if it's linked to the server instead of a mapped drive, in case users have network shares mapped to different drives  \njstoldt - (17:04): Menso: users don't do that here, IBM and administrators make sure of that  \njstoldt - (17:04): most of them wouldn't know how to change it anyway  \njstoldt - (17:05): most of them users, that is ;)  \njstoldt - (17:05): you see, we got all those nicely mapped drives which everybody sees but only has limited access too and everyone keeps spreading documentation in twenty different places  \njstoldt - (17:05): unfortunately, not all of them are from my unit  \nMenso - (17:06): ah :-)  \njstoldt - (17:06): so sometimes i have to be able to just map to a file easily  \nMenso - (17:07): Would it be hard to adjust xwiki so that new pages are created as child pages of the page the user is currently viewing?  \njstoldt - (17:07): so it will neither get outdated files nor lose the possibility for the creator to updated it in a place he considers fine  \njstoldt - (17:07): Menso: you just need to add the link to the new page in the currently viewed page  \njstoldt - (17:07): clicking that link will automatically set the parent  \njstoldt - (17:08): on creation...  \nmflorea - (17:08): jstoldt: did you try to use the \"link to Web page\" dialog with file:// ?  \njstoldt - (17:09): mflorea: that works, i think... i used that already but i used it in the syntax directly, iirc  \nevalica left at 17:09 (Quit: Leaving.  \njstoldt - (17:09): anyway, how would i go about educating people who don't care too much about this on how to use file:///?  \njstoldt - (17:09): so i want to ease things for them, which is why i installed the windows path macro  \nMenso - (17:09): it wil set the parent to xwiki:Space.Doc  \nMenso - (17:09): instead of Space.Doc  \nMenso - (17:10): jstoldt: yeah, like creating a link to a page that doesn't exist makes that link set the parent too xwiki:Space.PageThatContainsTheLink instead of Space.PageThatContainsTheLink, it's a bug I think  \njstoldt - (17:10): Menso: yeah, noticed that too... at least sometimes. although there is little loss unless you try to export child pages, which fails as soon as you got identical headings in at least two of the pages (\\*cough\\* ;) )  \njstoldt - (17:11): i dunno if it's really a bug or a feature, to be quite honest  \nmflorea - (17:11): jstoldt: what do you mean by \"ease\"? what do you think it's hard to do right now?  \nMenso - (17:11): jstoldt: it's failing me for a customer that wants to use treeview to show the tree of documents but they have to fix the parents manually for all pages  \nvmassol - (17:12): mflorea: the users wouldn't know about /// or about \"/\" vs \"\\\"  \njstoldt - (17:12): exactly, vmassol  \njstoldt - (17:12): Menso: it does? that's weird, because i don't fix it here and it looks good in the document index tree  \njstoldt - (17:13): on 2.6^^  \nmflorea - (17:14): adding a custom dialog for each possible protocol (file:, doc:, path:, unc:, icon:, user:, etc.) requires a lot of work.  \nsilviar left at 17:14 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \njstoldt - (17:14): mflorea: i don't think it's hard but i'm a lot more nerdy then my colleagues here and it is one of the prequisits for my work that i give them something that is very very very easy to use because the people who will edit the wiki after my departure are not paid to edit full time but to do design stuff  \njstoldt - (17:15): well, i wouldn't know about that but i think at least being able to do it for file and possibly path will help  \ntmortagne - (17:15): mflorea: there should be some extension point to let someone provide it, WYSIWYG should not know most of theses link types  \njstoldt - (17:15): or path and unc... actually i don't know what they do X-D  \njstoldt - (17:16): tmortagne: extension point sounds great, so admin can decide what to add  \njstoldt - (17:16): and it can be very generic  \nnpm\\_\\_ joined #xwiki at 17:16  \ntmortagne - (17:16): especially since that's how link type are designed, there is not fixed list of types  \njstoldt - (17:17): yep  \ntmortagne - (17:17): s/not/no/  \nmflorea - (17:19): tmortagne, jstoldt: someone needs to write the code, as an extension or not.  \njstoldt - (17:19): just providing some basic capability. like a file browser, a dir browser, probably a attachment/xwiki files browser and an interface to work with would be neat  \nEnygma` left at 17:20 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \njstoldt - (17:20): true but if the extension interface and some basic capability is available someone is bound to come along and extend things at his whim and upload it to extension.xwiki.org  \njstoldt - (17:20): anyway, i have no idea about your schedules and everything, i am just speaking as a nerdy kind of user ;)  \nvmassol1 joined #xwiki at 17:22  \nMenso1 joined #xwiki at 17:22  \ntmortagne - (17:22): mflorea: i know but it's not about supporting evrything, what i mean is that what is really important is the extension point  \ntmortagne - (17:22): then anyone can provide it as an extension untill it validated in standard  \nMenso left at 17:23 (\\*.net \\*.split  \nsdumitriu left at 17:23 (\\*.net \\*.split  \nnpm\\_ left at 17:23 (\\*.net \\*.split  \nvmassol left at 17:23 (\\*.net \\*.split  \njstoldt - (17:26): well, since discussion died away and i wanted to go almost two hours ago... see you guys! ;)  \nmflorea - (17:27): bye  \njstoldt left at 17:27 (Quit: Page closed  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 17:30  \nmflorea - (17:33): sdumitriu: I can't reproduce the open office issue raised by sburjan.
