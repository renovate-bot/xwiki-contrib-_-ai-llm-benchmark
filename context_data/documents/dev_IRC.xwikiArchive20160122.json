I've tried to improve the doc at http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki80M1#HUpgrades let me know if it's ok and if I've understood it correctly. FTR I don't like that we reference jira issues in releases notes (or in code FWIW) as I consider the issue tracker a transient resource that can go away at any time. I prefer that our doc be self sustaining.  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you agree?  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW I think this should be added to the doc proper too  \n10:39\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n10:41\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I've commented on the jira issue  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should not be documented actually  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and no jira issue should have been created  \n11:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n12:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:53\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n13:06\u00a0<RodrigoXwiki>\u00a0has quit  \n13:17\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0has quit  \n13:45\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n13:53\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:15\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0is now known as <msmeria>  \n14:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:38\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:39\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:59\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: Hi  \n16:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Hi vmassol!  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should probably use https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/go-offline-mojo.html instead  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for your doc at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/FillLocalMavenRepository)  \n16:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, I didnt use it, not really, was just wondering for that guy who has troubel installing the ui on the mailing list  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0making the build fail is not very nice and this should avoid any build failure  \n16:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, but it could make the stuff look less than a hack, maybe  \n16:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it fails only in the validators, because the developers are not set up ... not due to dependencies  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it fails because you call install  \n16:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you call the depdnency plugin it shouldn't fail  \n16:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, yes, or that  \n16:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tested and it works, thanks!  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n16:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:04\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0Hi may I a quick question before the week end (if someone left) :-) ?  \n18:04\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0On my web site, I want to get some external json data from another web site (provided on http without authenticate).  \n18:04\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0Which way I have to import simple json data from external site or read it?  \n18:04\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0A nice API to read external http data?  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi Pbas1  \n18:13\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0Hi :)  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could check http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Include+External+Content  \n18:15\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0Ok thxs  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you need to parse the json then you could use groovy, the download + parsing can be done in 1 line  \n18:15\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0how do you do?  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are examples on e.x.o too  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm fine thanks  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying hard to fix your jira issue about the pdf export  \n18:16\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0I can parse with velocity too isn't it?  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you can too using $jsontool  \n18:16\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0yes I saw that  \n18:17\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0it seem a complicated issue  \n18:18\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0wow one line witth groovy ... thinking ...
