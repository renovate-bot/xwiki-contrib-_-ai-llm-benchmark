 \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no it's not for this reason  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm strange  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it wasnt building and I started manually the rendering module  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and now platform syas it's waiting for rendering  \n14:01\u00a0<nIMBVS>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: platform is supposed to wait for its dependencies to be done building, that's how we configured it  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but there were no dep being built  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I triggered the rendering job after  \n14:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I tough you said that you started rendering  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0look now  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's waiting for agent1 and 2 only  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so my question stays actually :)  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't want to run platform on agents 3-6?  \n14:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the fact that platform is buildeing on aagent1 and 2 is normal  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that looks like a bottleneck  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since only 2 agents out of 6 are working  \n14:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ui tests contently fail on 3-6 since a long time now  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0always?  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if that's the case it's high time we do something about it  \n14:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0most of the time from what I remember  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becuase right now we have only 2 agents basically  \n14:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n14:30\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very interesting: http://engineering.linkedin.com/testing/continuous-integration-mobile  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially the layout tests which we could do too  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys what is this page http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/XWikiAndEclipse ?  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should it be moved to the draft space? it doesn't look finished  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some guy just clicked on a question mark and created a new empty page...  \n14:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: don't we already have docs on xwiki and eclipse ?  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm seems outdated: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/BuildingInEclipse  \n14:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes wa have several documentations atround XWiki and Eclipse  \n14:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the eclipse/xwiki doc seems a bit scattered and outdated  \n14:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the only one up to date is http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DebugXEWithEclipse I think  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be great if someone could reorganize this doc a bit  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see the outdated doc is linked from http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DevelopmentTools#HEclipse  \n14:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll fix http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/BuildingInIdea  \n14:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0building on Eclipse is not really a very good idea IMO, easier with maven itself. I doubt anyone is doing it, probably why the doc has not been updated.  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0building means loading  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie setting up in your IDE  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can rename the page  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll rename the idea page  \n14:47\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\u00a0then there is everything needed on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DebugXEWithEclipse if the need is to setup up a Eclipse dev environment to work with XWiki  \n15:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0mflorea: Regarding comment preview, I was expecting the problem to be fixed by adding \"&sheet=\" to the URL  \n15:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Why doesn't that override the sheet? That's what I understood from the sheet module documentation  \n15:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: the sheet must exist. The sheet manager checks if the sheet document exists. Now, if you're asking why \"\" is no resolved as current document, that is because SheetRequestInitializer puts the sheet parameter on the execution context only if sheet request param is not empty.  \n15:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK  \n15:23\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I tried to pass the current document as well  \n15:23\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0sheet=Blog.WebHome  \n15:23\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But then nothing gets displayed  \n15:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Because the content of Blog.WebHome doesn't display anything  \n15:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0that's normak  \n15:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you need a sheet that display the content from the request  \n15:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0or the current content  \n15:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. a sheet that does what rendercontent.vm does  \n15:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0(should do, actually)  \n15:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0A/B?sheet=Space.Page means render the content of Space.Page in the context of A.B  \n15:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ah, I see why it doesn't work with the same document as the sheet  \n15:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so either we define a sheet for previewing comments, or we fix rendercontent.vm to take into account if the content is specified on the request.  \n15:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The passed content isn't taken into account since the sheet is requested from the database  \n15:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n15:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: can I force xwiki-manager to stop ? as far as I can see in http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-manager/4165/console looks like it's a jenkins issue since it did not seems to have executed maven at all  \n15:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking agent version  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: manager has been having this problem all the time for the past days  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you can stop it but next time it runs it'll be the same  \n15:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I don't understand how it can come from xwiki-manager itself since I don't see anything in the console  \n15:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like the slave used on agent-2 is pretty old compared to root jenkins, 1.423 instead of 1.449  \n15:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0samee for agent-1  \n15:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and probably others too I guess  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes would be good to upgrade them  \n15:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0doing it  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0upgrading jenkins too first maybe  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that we don't have to do ti again in a few days  \n15:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking the release note  \n15:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0starting upgrade of root jenkins  \n15:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Just realised that there's a problem with the license headers in the XML files  \n15:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In theory, the wiki content is under CC-SA  \n15:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Not LGPL  \n15:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So the pom should be updated  \n15:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0\"See the NOTICE file distributed with this work\" => there's no NOTICE file in XARs either, so the message is misleading  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we should have one  \n15:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, we should  \n15:58\u00a0<dbaeli>\u00a0vmassol: Back on confluence conversion subject : the use of converter works great, some issues with code macro inside a panel macro.
