At first it worked, creating blog headdings with \u00d6\u00dc\u00c4, but meanwhile it fails. Can it depend on a blog category i created with \u00c4\u00d6\u00dc, which i can not delete?

If you report it a developer will be able to take a look at it and see if it's a regression.  \n10:01\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Thanks for the info.  \n10:09\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Hello. Can someone tell me if I can use a dependency of an application which is attached as a XAR to a page ?  \n10:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am reffering to http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/FullCalendar+Application  \n10:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I need to add this application as a dependency to another app  \n10:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0mflorea, tmortagne , any idea ?  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: I don't really understand the question, something attachment to a page is an attachment, nothing else  \n10:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0where and how do you want to use that attachment ?  \n10:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I want to use this app as a dependency for another. Trying to fix http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XAMEETINGS-13  \n10:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sburjan: if you need to build the other app with maven then you need th dependency on a maven repo. If you just need to publish the other app on e.x.o, then it's enough to specify the dep on the extension page  \n10:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0okay, I go my answer. Thanks mflorea and tmortagne  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why did you talked about attachments ?  \n10:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you want as dependency exactly ? FullCalendar+Application ?  \n10:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: FullCalendar is not released on contrib, you have have the XAR attached to the extension page  \n10:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you can cannot use it as a dep on a maven proiect  \n10:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I tough sburjan was talking about an attachment in one of the application pages  \n10:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but you can use it as dep for another app that is published on e.x.o (as long as you don't want to build it with maven)  \n10:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well the Meeting Application is build with Maven, so ..  \n10:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thanks for the answers  \n10:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so you need to publish full calendar on contrib  \n10:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: Maven can only depends on Maven, it's as simple as that  \n10:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0before adding the dep on pom.xml  \n10:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0exo is not a maven repository  \n10:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thanks  \n10:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Guys could someone look at hidden doc feature when there's a page with translations, it doesn't seem to work  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I seleect hidden doc and save and then edit again it's not checked  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm in a training today so anyone who could look at this for 5.4 would be great)  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n10:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: so when you are in a translation and not on the document default version ? or is it failing in any version as long as there is a translation ?  \n10:40\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has quit  \n10:40\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:42\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm in the default  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but this page has \u00a01 translation  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no multilingual  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually checking sandbox  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can be reproduced on sandbox  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(my wiki is in fr)  \n10:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n10:56\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n10:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:01\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:10\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n11:11\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:12\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0is there a way to easily disable solr? (for testing purposes)  \n11:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: I have not tried lately, but maybe moving away the webapps/wiki/WEB-INF/lib/xwiki-platform-search-solr-\\* jars and restart works  \n11:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: yep, solr is not running now, thanks... and it took \"only\" 25k of database requests to display main page :)  \n11:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, this is definitely not normal  \n11:27\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep... i will try to disable one plugin after another to figure out what causes it... if i try to load empty page, it takes only 12 database requests (several session settings and few data selects) and it takes about a second, if i try to load document with an attachment and some text, it takes 80 database requests and ~3 seconds, but if i try to load main page, it takes about 1300 database requests and ~5-10 seconds  \n11:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: lucene also do the same thing than Solr at startup (when there is not already a lucene index)  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the ancestor of Solr module basically  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we will soon remove it form XE  \n11:34\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: yep, i'm familiar with lucene, but it should be ok (no info messages in log, no large asnych increment of queries), but i will try to disable it too  \n11:34\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:35\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0disabling LucenePlugin should do the trick, right?  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: yes  \n11:43\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0well, startup still takes 20k requests (selects/updates), but loading normal page takes 200-400 requests  \n11:52\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0slowest part is still database (according to cpu sampler), but it's way faster than previously (hibernate now uses mariadb connector + hikari connection pool)  \n12:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:26\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0is now known as <evalica>  \n13:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:02\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:05\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0has quit  \n14:31\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:32\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n14:34\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:13\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0is there a reason why hibernate mapping doesn't contain \"cache\" element? or is is set in source?  \n15:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n15:43\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:06\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:35\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n16:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<sashyla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:51\u00a0<sashyla>\u00a0has quit  \n16:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0hi devs  \n16:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have a problem while migrating from 5.2.2 to 5.4-SNAPSHOT  \n16:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hi devs.. how distant of you..
