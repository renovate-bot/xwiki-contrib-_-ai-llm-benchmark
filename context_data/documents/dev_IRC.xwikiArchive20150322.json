The \"default\" one that serializes everything and the local one that serializes without the wiki prefix  \n13:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0it could be really helpful in some situations when you need to compare a string serialization with a document reference and you're not really so willing to get a context / component manager so that you can have a serializer...  \n15:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0+1 thought about that for a while  \n15:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0they can also self-parse if you know the entire path (including wiki)  \n16:09\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n16:09\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:52\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:09\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:20\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has quit  \n21:28\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:29\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n21:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:23\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:56\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:02\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit\n"}
