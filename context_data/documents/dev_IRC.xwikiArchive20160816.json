Is this a feature of xwiki or xwiki.org?  \n11:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0http://blabla.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Admin looks like it`s the admin user of the \"blabla\" wiki  \n11:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but it`s not  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting to modify all contirbutor ids  \n11:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m not very sure what it is... it might be some apache configuration on xwiki.org, but the result is not natural to me  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for uixp  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I agree  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the type of the xproperty is\"page\" so I'll need to change that to string  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0changing it  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw it's strange that we don't have a Page displayer that provides a link to the page  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the LT doesn't display any link\u00e0  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: myxwiki.org is back  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0870 failures for http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-escaping/ :(  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lots of \"WARNING: Unescaped ' character\"  \n13:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:20\u00a0<Joerg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:21\u00a0<Joerg>\u00a0is now known as <Guest47634>  \n14:21\u00a0<Guest47634>\u00a0Hello, i search for the server requiments for xwiki and cant find them. could someone help me out?  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Guest47634: see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation#HHardwareandSoftwarerequirements  \n14:30\u00a0<Guest47634>\u00a0thanks, vmassol , but i miss the prozessor sepcs  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed we're missing that, not sure what to put since it depends on what you'll do with yuor wiki  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't have much experience myself  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll ask around  \n14:32\u00a0<Guest47634>\u00a0its for 200-250 registrated users.. thank you  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep I saw your requests to XWiki SAS ;)  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the number of users is not a parameter for this though  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0TPS would be a better parameter  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it depends a lot on memory too  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and about what you'll use xwiki for  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hard to recommend anything  \n14:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know xwiki installs with several 100K of users that require very little cpu  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I knoow installs with 5 users that require huge cpu ;)  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(because that wiki doesn't a lot of processing)  \n14:37\u00a0<Guest47634>\u00a0its primariy for an lexicon used, but we dont have a one server... so they send me on the quest to find out what we need  \n14:38\u00a0<Guest47634>\u00a0troubeling i\u00b4m a preacher not an it sepcialist...  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need it installed on premises?
