Anyone here knows why groovy code require the author of the including doc (not as I have expected, the content doc) to have programming rights ? This put a major restriction, since object sheet could not execute groovy code, when the object document is not created by a user having programming rights. Example, rendering XWikiUserSheet with groovy code is not possible. And this is not what the API check does to pr  \nasyd - (24/11/2008 10:47): you may don't need programming rights, regarding which API you use  \nasyd - (24/11/2008 10:47): but anyway it's a good thing to restrict the usage of groovy, otherwise users are able to do what they want   \nDenis - (24/11/2008 10:48): asyd: to run any groovy code, up to now, you should have programming rights, and these rights are currently tested on the author of the including doc, not the security doc  \nasyd - (24/11/2008 10:49): hmm ok  \nDenis - (24/11/2008 10:49): this is opposed to the restriction access done for accessing the priviledged API, which is check on the security doc (sdoc)  \nDenis - (24/11/2008 10:50): this makes the usage of groovy really restricted or tricky  \nDenis - (24/11/2008 10:50): so I wonder if there is any reason for that, or if this is a bug ?  \nasyd - (24/11/2008 10:51): hmm, tried the mailing lists?  \nDenis - (24/11/2008 10:51): not yet :)  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 11:48): XWiki.XWikiServerXeclipse was modified by XWiki.RaffaelloPelagalli (Added object) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiServerXeclipse  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 11:48): XWiki.XWikiServerXeclipse was modified by XWiki.RaffaelloPelagalli - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiServerXeclipse  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 13:06): XWiki.LucivanaFroes was modified by XWiki.LucivanaFroes (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/LucivanaFroes  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:26): vmassol: Following xwiki/2.0 code \\*\\*Cost:\\*\\* is this correct ? Basically i need to bold the whole Cost: part, how do i do that ?  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:27): ok, \\*\\*Cost~:\\*\\*  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:27): asiri: ah I see  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:27): but this : <strong>Cost:</strong>  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:27): :(  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:27): cost:xxx is considered an URI  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:28): ohh, same issue we discussed earlier ? :)  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:28): (vmassol)  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:28): I would have thought it would work though since after \":\" there was \\*\\* and not some normal text  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:28): don't know what earlier is  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:28): but yes  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:28): this format:  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:28): scheme:something  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:29): is a link  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:29): hmmm that said I thought we were supporting only some uris  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:29): let me check  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:29): I think there might be something wrong here  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:29): (asiri)  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:29): since normally only \"mailto:\", \"attach:\" and \"image:\" are valid URIs  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:30): previously we hadd a problem with <p>example:<i>hi</i></p> ... which is converted into example://hi which is scheme://something format  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:30): it hought it has to be (scheme)://(something) and not just (scheme):(something)  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:31): he he  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:31): this is different  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:31): since in your example above it's a URL not a URI  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:31): right.  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:32): ok I know what the pb is  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:32): wikimodel is indeed passing this as a reference token to us  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:32): we parse it and since we don't recognize a valid URI we consider that \"code:\\*\\*\" is a reference  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:33): i didn't know the difference between a uri and a url .. :P  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:33): asiri: can you create a jira issue for this please?  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:33): (a url is a special uri)  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:33): see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/URI.html  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:34): a URI can be either a URN or a URL is that correct ?  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:34): A URI is a uniform resource identifier while a URL is a uniform resource locator. Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of URIs, uniform resource names (URNs), which name resources but do not specify how to locate them. The mailto, news, and isbn URIs shown above are examples of URNs.   \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:35): got it :)  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:35): vmassol: should the jira be about this specific scenario or a more generic one ?  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:36): asiri: it should be about inline reference pointing to unknown URIs  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:36): which we should leave as normal text and not references  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:36): you can use your example in the jira issue  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:36): don't worry I'll fix the subject if need be  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:36): (asiri)  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:36): vmassol: what do you mean by a reference ? sorry, should i know that already ?  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:36): :)  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:37): a reference is either a link or an image in our syntax  \nasiri - (24/11/2008 13:37): oki doki, now i get it, thanks. (vmassol)  \nvmassol\\_ - (24/11/2008 13:37): but an inline reference is always a URI  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 14:34): Design.RatingsImplementation was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (Lead & Jira issue) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/RatingsImplementation  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 14:38): Design.NewWysiwygEditorInterface was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvdrean - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/NewWysiwygEditorInterface  \nmaggo - (24/11/2008 16:58): hi @ all, is there a howto for logging xwiki messages with rsyslog/syslog-ng for central loggin?  \nasyd - (24/11/2008 16:59): configure log4j to use a syslog output?  \nmaggo - (24/11/2008 17:12): asyd: yes but i don't know anything about log4j, but i infer that it is possible over log4j?  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 17:44): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 17:49): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 18:00): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (Added image \"Create JSX Object\") - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 18:06): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (Added image \"My first JSX\") - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 18:10): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (Added image \"JSX Magic\") - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 18:26): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (Added a note on the generated script tag) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 19:24): XWiki.XWikiAllGroup was modified by xwiki:XWiki.RaffaelloPelagalli - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiAllGroup  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 19:24): XWiki.WebMaster was modified by XWiki.VincentMassol (deleted document) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/WebMaster  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 19:32): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 19:43): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 20:28): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (Wrote the minimal SSX section) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 21:42): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (minor heading change) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 23:04): Main.Steve Bumbaugh was modified by XWiki.john\\_ewing (deleted document) - http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Steve+Bumbaugh  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 23:15): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (Added JSX code for the AddSizes extension) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 23:18): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (formatting) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 23:21): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter ([formatting]) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 23:24): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \nxwikibot - (24/11/2008 23:27): Drafts.HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial was modified by xwiki:XWiki.JeromeVelociter (Added SSX code for the AddSizes extension) - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/HowToWriteSkinExtensionsTutorial  \n\n"}
