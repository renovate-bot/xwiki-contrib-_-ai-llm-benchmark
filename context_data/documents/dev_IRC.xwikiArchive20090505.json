 \nkraze - (05/05/2009 04:12): nope, mostly links  \nkraze - (05/05/2009 04:13): \"Useful links\" types.. so that these links do not span pages and pages worth of lines with only a few words or less per line  \nkraze - (05/05/2009 04:14): s/types/within tables  \nsdumitriu - (05/05/2009 04:15): So this might be a real problem...  \nkraze - (05/05/2009 04:15): these tables were working up to 1.4.1.  \nsdumitriu - (05/05/2009 04:15): Can you create an issue on jira.xwiki.org and paste such a table?  \nkraze - (05/05/2009 04:15): sure  \nkraze - (05/05/2009 04:20): I just tested it on Netcipia and it works ok  \nkraze - (05/05/2009 04:20): perhaps this is a bug that has already been addressed. \u00a0do you still want me to file a bug report?
