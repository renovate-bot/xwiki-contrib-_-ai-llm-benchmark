 \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: hmm are you sure?  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just found ExtensionVersionClass in git  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in platform  \n13:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you are mixing stuff  \n13:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i'm talking aout compatibility field  \n13:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this field does not exist  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but I don't care about this field  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course there is versions in XWiki Repository  \n13:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the first thing you talk about in the issue...  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I care is adding a new field to ExtensionVersionClass  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and deprecated the \"compatibility\" one)  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*depreczate  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*deprecate  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XWIKI-9642 is valid for me  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue is about adding a field to ExtensionVersionClass  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you change the title sure :)  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now it's talking about merging a field that does not exist in the version object  \n13:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: one of the idea I have regarding this Compatilibty field is using tags maybe. Instead of the free form, we could have tags like \"5.0\" , \"6.1\", etc. this way we could use the TagCloud and filter what applications are tested / working on a specific version.  \n13:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0title changed  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would make tag cloud quite a mess IMO  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have 2 solutions IMO  \n13:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0then we can create a tags funtionality clone just for the compatibility versions  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- a new freeform text for each ExtensionVersionClass  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- a new XClass for holding compat information (more structured)  \n13:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now the issue at XWiki Repository level is that there is no reason XR talk about XE, it does not even know that exist  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it should not be related to XE, we can either put \"XWiki\" or have a field to enter the \"product\"  \n13:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I'd like the new XClass with compatibility info, and we can borrow the UI from tags. That's what Jira is also doing\u2026 having like tags things.  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0new XClass would have fields: extension version, xwiki flavor, works or not (true|false) and notes  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0missing xwiki flavor version  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(note: default value for \"xwiki flavor\" should be XE for now)  \n13:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it should be clear it's about users tests, you should not have the feeling that if you are installing the extension in a different version it's not going to work, the supposedly proper place for that information technically is declared dependencies  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I also think a new xclass might be better, wdyt tmortagne? However the version values should be left open, so I could write \"5.4.5 - 6.1\" for the XE version for ex  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes indeed  \n13:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not XE, but a configurable default flavor that would be configured in exo  \n13:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0about the version we have a version range syntax  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's hard  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for a UI  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0really really hard  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the best is probably to introduce a version range property type and related UI  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now it's starting to become a complex topic  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I meant to code this in \u00a01-2 hours initially and quickly  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that Andrea could fill the info  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if we want to display a related filter it needs to be parseable  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can start with text  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*could  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not going to be very useful if people put ranges  \n14:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: how about allowing thing like 6.x - this way you don't need ranges  \n14:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0since we have a way to write versions more compact  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since it's about users tests it should probably be single versions only  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you test on a specific version  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then the filter is a simple text filter indeed  \n14:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the ranges could be used just in the display if we have +10 versions  \n14:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0with the ability to expand  \n14:02\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and display the exact versions  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes a single version is simpler for sure  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder if we should replace the \"whether it works or not\" by a reating  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*rating  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0an integer from 1 to 5  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or  \n14:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ratings are for quality, not for 'workability' :)  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not exactly caty  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example if some translations are missing  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it work or not?  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or if some title is badly displayed  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the alternative is to remove the concept of \"works or not\" and just keep the notes field  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well it's not that simple, if you have an extension working since a specific version you might end up with a very bad grade because someone put 0 for a previous version  \n14:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it depends what we really want to display here  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex on http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Sequence+Diagram+Macro we have a green tick  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to indicate it \"works\" iwth XE 6.0.1  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the concept is fuzzy  \n14:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but this field is usally here to indicate since when you can use that extension  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think what we want to show is for a user who wants to install this extensiosn whether he'll have some surprise or not  \n14:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it was not really meant to indicate you if it's good  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the point of testing then?  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you don't say whether it works or not!  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just saying it's been tested provides no value  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to say whether it worked or not  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whatever \"worked\" means  \n14:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it does not work in a version you are not supposed to say you tested it, tested here means validated  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i don't agree  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's very useful  \n14:09\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0IMO all shouldhave green thicks. If you find a red thick just replace it with green on a previous version. Compatibility means on which versions the app is working.  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to not that it doesn't work in such version  \n14:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's how the field always been used  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/not/know  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: no  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we don't test all versions  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you don't if it's not htere becasue  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- it hasn't been tested  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- it doesn't work  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: errr?  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you expect people who want to install an extension  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to go through all the jira issues?  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I mean\u2026 all apps should be working, if they are not working than is something temporary  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr  \n14:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0:)  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then why test anything?  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if all is working  \n14:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: if you want to add grades just do that but don't try to implement it as a replacement, we can always see later  \n14:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0to tell the people on what versions to install  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and why report it?  \n14:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0all the versions not mentioned.. they should not used them there  \n14:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we do want grades at some point anyway so OK lets add grade, we don't really need to debate if it's a replacement of this field just now  \n14:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the only reason there is no grades is that we did not had time to do it yet  \n14:12\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't feel grades indicates that an extension is just doing what's is supposed to do  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's more generic but it doesn't include that too  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a value you put on an extension even if it has no bug  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I doubt that a non working version of an extension would get a good grade  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*doesn't/does  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but you can get 5/5 for a crappy extension that does not have bugs with that logic  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'd put 5/5 if you're very satifised with the extension  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie it works + it's useful  \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so how much point does \"it works\" gives you ?  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a non useful extension but working wouldn't get a good grade IMO  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grading is subjective, it's up to the person who grades to decide that  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again if I install an extension and it doesn't work, and I want to grade it,  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the extensions is very nice  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it depends what you are doing, Andreea is not jugging whether an extension is good or not  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd give like 3/5 and in a comment, say: \"nice extension but doesn't work\"  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sure  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was not even suggesting that she grades them  \n14:17\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you talked about covering Andreea use case with grades...  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0although she probably should since she's testing them  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I'd like her to fill absolutely  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is when it doesn't work, to fill the Notes part about what doesn't work, (a jira link would be best)  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0can be in the extension description  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have suggetsed a notes field above  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's related to the combination of XWki flavor/version and extension version  \n14:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the point is only jugging if an extension is just working then it's not grades  \n14:20\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdym by \"just working\"?

 \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my idea now is:  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or you need to make sure it's not written \"Does ot work at all\" in the Notes ?  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- add support for specifying the issue tracker in some properties  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(issue tracker type, url, project id)  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- display the list of known issues automatically in the sheet  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(query all open issues for affects >= the latest published version)  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- in the release notes section, generate automaitcally the list of issues fixed for the release  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Now  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if there are some problems with a version you can add an xobject but put your remarks in the notes  \n16:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"has been validated\" sounds a bit misleading but maybe it's just me  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wondered  \n16:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe \"has been tested\"  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I had \"has been tested\" initialy  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could put that back  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(but it's not like I was an English expert)  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0putting back  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: where is the sheet displaying the compatibility property?
