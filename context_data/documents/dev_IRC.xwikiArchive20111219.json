 \n16:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0in the user profile menu  \n16:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0In velocity, when I write $xwiki.getURL($doc.fullName, \"edit\", \"\"), the result is: \"xwiki/bin/edit/Space/Page\", but how can I get the url with the \"http://server/\" part?  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you shouldn't need the full URL normally  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you need it?  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for a wiki link?  \n16:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because I want a link like this \"http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/edit/Macros/NewPage?editor=object&classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&object=0\"  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but a best practice is to let the browser compute the full url  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now if you really need full URL the api is $xwiki.getExternalURL() AFAIR (but there are few cases where you really need this)  \n16:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I agree, but I didn't manage to get an URL for the object editor by the normal way  \n16:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0maybe I made a mistake  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what does full URL have to do with object editor?  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$xwiki.getURL(\u2026) will get you the URL  \n16:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I do $xwiki.getURL($doc.fullName, \"edit\", \"editor=object&classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&object=$i\")  \n16:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and then, the link starts to \"xwiki/bin/...\"  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sounds good  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so the browser tries to compute from the current url  \n16:49\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: yes I have, and I also wonder why I have that menu ?  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're doing js?  \n16:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so I get \"current\\_url/my\\_wanted\\_url\"  \n16:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0no no, just an HTML link  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0try [[my label>>path:$xwiki.getURL($doc.fullName, \"edit\", \"editor=object&classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&object=$i\")]] in syntax 2.1  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or in HTML: <a href=\"$xwiki.getURL($doc.fullName, \"edit\", \"editor=object&classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&object=$i\")\">label</a>  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: see http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA  \n16:52\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: right now the translations are registered at wiki level (and not by using ApplicationResources) so that's why you don`t have the translation keys set up right.  \n16:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0With the fiest code, I get \"<a href=\"/xwiki/bin/create/MacrosEditor/path%3A%2Fxwiki%2Fbin%2Fedit%2FMacros%2FNewPage?editor=object&amp;classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&amp;object=1\">my label</a>\"  \n16:52\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0regarding the actual menus themselves, they appear because you have Workspaces installed  \n16:53\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I think one way of getting rid of them is by removing WorkspaceManager.WebHome from the main menu (or renaming it to something else)  \n16:53\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*first  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I've updated http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA to show the 2 possibilites  \n16:53\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: not sure to follow  \n16:53\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: those menus also appear only for global users  \n16:54\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: do you mean that because I have follow the link to Workspace.Install, I have got them ?  \n16:55\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0no. You have the menus because the Workspace Application is present on your XWiki.  \n16:55\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it does not matter if you followed or not WorkspaceManager.Install  \n16:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok, the strange thing is that I have an other comportement on my local wiki (3.2)  \n16:56\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and since you have the Workspace app installed, those menus appear only to global users (that can create workspaces and that are aware of this feature)  \n16:56\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0subwiki local users should not be affected  \n16:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: vmassol used 2.1 syntaxe, looks like you are trying to do [[xwiki.getURL($doc.fullName, \"edit\", \"editor=object&classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&object=$i\")]] in 2.0 syntax  \n16:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0[[$xwiki.getURL($doc.fullName, \"edit\", \"editor=object&classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&object=$i\")]]  \n16:59\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: mmm, but since I have not really install workspace, these menu are useless and could not work, this is confusing  \n16:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in 2.0 you will have to use html for partial URL because the parser thing it's a document name  \n16:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it it produce you a link to create the document \"/xwiki/bin/edit/Macros/NewPage?editor=object&classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&object=0\"  \n17:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I get this result: <a href=\"/xwiki/bin/create/MacrosEditor/%2Fxwiki%2Fbin%2Fedit%2FMacrosEditor%2FWebHome?editor=object&amp;classname=XWiki.WikiMacroClass&amp;object=0\">  \n17:00\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: if you have XEM, you have installed Workspaces. Maybe not installed completely, but you have it installed :)  \n17:00\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: by the way, I have followed the link to the install page per curiosity, and because the home page had some untranslated stuffs  \n17:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so either you use 2.1 syntax with path prefix like vmassol did or you use html macro in 2.0 syntaxe  \n17:00\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: what stuff?  \n17:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: ok but what is your source ?  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I put the 2 examples in my page at http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA)  \n17:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I use yours for this result  \n17:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0as I told you this does not work in 2.0 syntax  \n17:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I did not told you to use that :)  \n17:01\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: in the tree on the home  \n17:01\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0your install page also install some translation for them  \n17:03\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0ah, right... probably the workspaces macro  \n17:03\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: when you means to global users, do you want to means global users or only global admins ?  \n17:04\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0workspaces is usable by global users, not only admins; so it's displayed to all users of the main wiki  \n17:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0My Problem: http://pastebin.com/pHP11Yus , but it works well on PlayGround... (2d try)  \n17:10\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: you should really enhance in the release notes the fact that upgrading user that do not want the new Workspace feature should not install the XEM xar, but the XE xar and the WikiManager application only.  \n17:11\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: you are right  \n17:13\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0By the way, where are the links to the release notes ?  \n17:13\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol, it seems Sergui does not put them  \n17:15\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: you forget XEM  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: could you addi t?  \n17:20\u00a0<CIA-115>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f feature-extension-versions\u000f \\* r957330f\u000f \u000f/ (37 files in 18 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7240: Add support for special versions qualifiers and version ...  \n17:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: what syntax are you using ?  \n17:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0XWiki 2.0  \n17:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what you have on http://pastebin.com/pHP11Yus \u00a0cannot work with xwiki/2.0 syntax for sure  \n17:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0are you sure you are testing with xwiki/2.0 on playground ?  \n17:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Oh Ok. i switched to 2.1 and I have the good result  \n17:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sorry, I didn't notice this parameter  \n17:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so I tried with 2.1 on playground (I used the vincent's page)  \n17:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is not mouch difference between 2.1 and 2.0 except for this particular case ;)  \n17:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\\*much  \n17:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can't use 2.0 link syntax to display a relative link, you have to use html  \n17:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok :)  \n17:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you have resolved my problem :)  \n17:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0note that we should shortly make the 2.1 syntax final and there is no difference with the 2.1 syntax in 3.2 so you can safely use it it's not going to change  \n17:26\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: if we follow XE install + WikiManager, we do not have the manager dashboard anymore, neither we have the wikis link in the left panel  \n17:27\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0the XWikiServerXWiki initial server page does not exist either  \n17:28\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I do not see the point to keep the old manager dashboard in XEM if we should not install it  \n17:35\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0the Application manager is also partially installed  \n17:35\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: the best would not be to install all ui and deselect the workspace manager ?  \n17:36\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0and maybe the Main.WebHome and to rename the WikiManager.Dashboard to Main.WebHome ?  \n17:39\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Denis: sorry for the lag.

(see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Livetable+Macro - \"Custom JSON\" part)  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: depends, most of the time you don't have the choice if you wish to add some extra niceties  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's your use case?  \n18:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I'm doing a livetable which displays all the macros  \n18:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and, on the \"visibility\" column, I want the HTML input to set the value  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm so you wish to do live editing?  \n18:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes :)  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have never done this but I know jerome velociter or ludovic dubost have done it  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there might be an extension somewhere for doing this but it may not have been published on e.x.o  \n18:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I do this for my last training day  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well if you find how to do this, it might be good to document it somewhere :)  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not that hard probably though  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you inject some HTML somehow, either with JS or with the returned JSON  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then you'll need to do Ajax request to use the propadd/edit/remove actions  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then use JS to refresh the LT content  \n18:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0exactly  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u2026 something like that I think (I've never done it though)  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbl  \n18:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so, it leads me to that question: can I have the html code for this \"$doc.display(\"visibility\", \"edit\", $macro)\" with \"get\" action and outputSyntax=plain?  \n18:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I believe doc.display use the current rendering system, so it displays nothing on \"get\"  \n18:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but I would like to get what the HTML renderer would do  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know what the best to achieve what you want, you could ask someone with the knowledge. However to get the HTML, it's easy just put what you want in a wiki page, and check the rendered source code  \n18:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol> Yes, but the HTML may evolve in the future (if another choice for \"visibility\" is created, for example) , so I will have to do the update manually. But, it could be a solution.  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a better solution is to use the code directly in the JSON so that it's evaluated  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and rendered in html)  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$doc.display generates HTML  \n18:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yep, but livetable query the JSON page in plain text  \n18:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so the HTML is not generated  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n18:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the velocity macro is executed  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you have $doc.display in it, it'll get executed and generate HTML  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the display method is some old method which incorrectly generates HTML if you prefer  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since then we've added the rendering engine to support multiple syntaxes  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the future we're going to add {{display}} macros that generate XDOM  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of generating HTML  \n18:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0when I do doc.display(...) I get the HTML, but if I access the page like that \"xwiki/bin/get/MacrosEditor/ResultsPage?outputSyntax=plain\", the HTML is not generated  \n18:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it makes sense, of course, but since I'm trying to do something tricky...  \n18:37\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0Enygma': I have install XEM with Workspace.Manger, and change the include on WebHome, it seems the nice way to go for me. But on subwikis, I notice that even if the menu has gone, there is a >> before the WIKI: wikiname menu which is probably not expected  \n18:37\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0s/with/without  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA and http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0both generate HTML  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with get it's just not rendered as HTML but that's not a problem, the livetable will still get it)  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I don't know enough to help you here without trying to do what you're working on  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I said I've never done this  \n18:44\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol> http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/get/Main/VMA?outputSyntax=plain  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have no idea why get action with outputsyntax is empty  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would need to look at the code  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I know  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's because it's producing a RawBlock I think  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is ignored by the plain renderer  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but as I said I have no idea what you're doing  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that doesn't help  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't use outputxyntax=plain if it doesn't do what you want :)  \n18:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol> I agree, but LiveTable does :)  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd give the same suggestion i gave earlier  \n18:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0So, I Believe I just try to do something that is not natural :)  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is to contact either jerome or ludovic  \n18:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so, I will generate the HTML myself  \n18:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who I know have done this  \n18:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok, but thx :)  \n18:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could generate the HTML but I agree it's not nice  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all this is strange though  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I remember pushing some html in livetables in the past (not on purpose)  \n18:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have to go  \n19:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0good evening :)  \n19:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bye  \n20:04\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:04\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:12\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0I can't seem to get into the class editor for XWikiPreferences, every path I take fails to show the edit menu and only shows the admin app  \n20:12\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0I'm running as superadmin  \n20:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Lycurgus: You'll have to enter the URL manually  \n20:14\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0what is it?  \n20:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=class  \n20:15\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0thank you  \n20:19\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0(the parameter isn't needed just path member edit)  \n20:19\u00a0<Lycurgus>\u00a0sorry just getting back into this  \n20:39\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:36\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n22:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:31\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
