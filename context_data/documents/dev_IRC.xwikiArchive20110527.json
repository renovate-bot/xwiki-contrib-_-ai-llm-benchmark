I can't imagine a lot of users are going to have trouble with it.  \n17:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So, all clear for RC1?  \n17:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Actually I'm fixing some of the bugs reported

 \n19:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm pretty sure I had it working locally last night  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's probably environment dependent  \n19:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Also I fixed that popup issue by adding a popup.dismiss() to the setSyntaxId function but apparently I forgot to commit  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: I fixed it  \n19:13\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no need for any dismiss  \n19:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0then a thunderstorm came and got my power  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nor for any popup :)  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I fixed it this morning)  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(morning for me ;))  \n19:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yes but if anyone uses that setSyntaxId() they're going to have the same problem  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're right  \n19:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'll add it as well  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0be careful that there not always a conversion  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I mean there's not always a popup)  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(only if there's an available renderer for the target syntax)  \n19:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm  \n19:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it should at worst though throw an exception which is far better than ceasing up the executor  \n19:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/a81e4d814e1bf30886acb193c33afe32001dc614  \n19:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0And I want to not pull this into the RC1 branch.  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need a proper soltuion  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0throwing an exception is not a good solution either  \n19:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0We agreed no new features and we need to draw a line somewhere  \n19:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I can add the line or I can leave it, for now it doesn't matter and I don't see the need to throw too many man/hours at this right now.  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm spending hours these days trying to fix exception/stck trace caused by sloppy programming we did in the past  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'd rather not have to fix this again in a few weeks if possible :)  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the build shouldn't throw unecessary stack traces  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in general  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some of our unit tests are really bad in this regard  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they throw lots of exception  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when you look at the console you have to know the \"normal\" stack traces from the \"error\" stack traces  \n19:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Well the issue is closed and we both have a huge amount of work ahead if we are going to have a release before 2012  \n19:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: re port issue, at least now we know ;) but it does not help much...  \n19:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: I've been working on fixing the port issue, I still need some time to finish fixing it  \n19:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0tmortagne: I don't like your patch to XWIKI-6650  \n19:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I need fabio's help actually but he's not been online today)  \n19:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: this is a work in progress in a feature branch  \n19:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you don''t have to like it right now :)  \n19:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Oh, I'm sorry then.  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder how you see it's in a branch when looking at github  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/a81e4d814e1bf30886acb193c33afe32001dc614  \n19:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I would like it if everyone was giving a hand with the release but I can't complain too loudly if I don't have to remove it from the RC branch  \n19:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0s/release/stabilization/  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: indeed I can't see how to know that from the link you just gave  \n19:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not very handy  \n19:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: I did most part of the work before actually and just committed/pushed today  \n19:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ok you're forgiven ;)  \n19:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0because I needed to switch to master actually  \n19:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0even \"Switch branches\" does not tel you the current one  \n19:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0what I'm finding hard to understand it is says port in use but lsof | grep LISTEN is not giving me any listening ports  \n19:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0problem is that a same commit can be on several branches right ? or do they have different id for each branch ?  \n19:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0so it must be bound but not listening or connected and that sounds like a mistake  \n19:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0they will have a different id  \n19:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n19:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the id is like the sha1 of the entire source tree  \n19:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: indeed lsof -i :9010 did not give me anything after the tests were executed  \n19:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then github UI guy is lazy :)  \n19:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0so if the branch is precisely the same as the master then it's \\_possible\\_  \n19:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it is indicated by the fact that the branch is at the top of the list  \n19:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looking if I can find github bug report  \n19:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the \"switch branches\" list  \n19:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's as if it was the maven java process that stops it  \n19:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the port)  \n19:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: I don't think so  \n19:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0running on local to see what happens...  \n19:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's not how current branch is generally indicated in github  \n19:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0look at https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform for example  \n19:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm  \n19:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0mm indeed there's some kind of mistake because the corrent branch is usually checked  \n19:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: one idea would be to upgrade the jetty version we're using since 1) it's an upgrade release and 2) it could maybe stop the jmx subsystem better....  \n19:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: should not harm anyway  \n19:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0when is this upgrade?  \n19:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0for what version?  \n19:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what upgrade?  \n19:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0of jetty  \n19:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't any scheduled upgrade  \n19:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/don't/don't know/  \n19:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we do have a jira about it  \n19:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: I think vmassol meant that 3.1 is more a less an upgrade branch or lots of things  \n19:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-6525  \n19:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\"indeed there's some kind of mistake because the corrent branch\"
