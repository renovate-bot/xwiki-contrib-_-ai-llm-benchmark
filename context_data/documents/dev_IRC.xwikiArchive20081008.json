The problem is whether we should go for jcr webdav server or a generic webdav server ... and why ... i'm kind of stuck here ..  \nasiri - (08/10/2008 18:16): how is jcr comming up ? was it implemented at the time where we started xwiki-webdav ? I hope not .. :)  \nasiri - (08/10/2008 18:17): because if we had jcr at that time we shouldn't have opted for a separate webdav implementation as we have now ... i wonder if we'd have to dump all efforts on webdav (what we have now) :(  \namelentev1 - (08/10/2008 18:19): This feature was in jackrabbit/exo since almost beginning. But we haven't a normal JCRStorage for use it  \nasiri - (08/10/2008 18:19): yes, true ..  \nasiri - (08/10/2008 18:20): so webdav should have followed jcr .. but we had them parallel is it the case ? :)  \namelentev1 - (08/10/2008 18:21): yes :)  \nasiri - (08/10/2008 18:22): i wonder what we can do now ... think we'll have to wait for vincent's advice on this ..  \nasiri - (08/10/2008 18:24): amelentev1 : Shall i start a discussion on the list about this conflict ?  \nxwikibot - (08/10/2008 18:25): XWiki.StephaneDugravot was modified by XWiki.StephaneDugravot (Created user) - http://workspaces.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/StephaneDugravot  \namelentev1 - (08/10/2008 18:26): asiri: yes, I think so  \nasiri - (08/10/2008 18:26): ok  \nxwikibot - (08/10/2008 23:07): XWiki.ADie was modified by XWiki.ADie (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/ADie  \nxwikibot - (08/10/2008 23:14): Main.ShortURLs was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ADie (Added comment) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ShortURLs  \nxwikibot - (08/10/2008 23:40): Main.ShortURLs was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Added comment) - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ShortURLs  \n\n"}
