Oddly enough there aren't a real lot of services provided.  \nztane - (09:59): do not want anything to leak out to nonauthorized, except the password reset form  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:04  \nsdumitriu - (10:11): ztane: Sorry, that's not possible yet  \nsdumitriu - (10:12): Preventing unauthenticated access really prevents it  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 10:21  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 10:23  \ncjdelisle - (10:28): abusenius: Any thing else you need in xwiki-crypto? (working on the proposal)  \nabusenius - (10:32): hm, no, just the methods for storing/loading certs/keys that we might want put elsewhere  \nabusenius - (10:32): \\*to put  \ncjdelisle - (10:33): Yea, IMO load/store is not really in the scope of crypto.  \nabusenius - (10:35): should I move it to signedscripts? thats the only place it's used atm  \ncjdelisle - (10:36): \\*distraction: IPv6 is a joke, 19.0.0.0 - 19.255.255.255 is Ford Motor Company ip space, it is not even announced to the backbone routers.  \ncjdelisle - (10:36): What car company doesn't need 16,000 unused ips?  \nabusenius - (10:36): \\*IPv4?  \ncjdelisle - (10:37): IP6 is a joke because like 40% of ip4 numbers are routed, 3% respond to pings.  \nabusenius - (10:37): it's a good investment, they will be able to sell it for a lot of money quite soon :)  \ncjdelisle - (10:37): Not if arin/ripe catch you.  \nabusenius - (10:37): well, it's just that nobody uses them  \nabusenius - (10:38): well, thats another question  \ncjdelisle - (10:38): Well not nobody, some halliburton space suddenly started getting announced from eastern europe.  \ncjdelisle - (10:38): spam spam spam spam  \ncjdelisle - (10:41): Halliburton 34.0.0.0 - 34.255.255.255 \u00a0(to their credit they announce a couple hundred ips in that range and run their site in it.)  \nabusenius - (10:42): I'Ve read somewhere that one of the problems is that they used to give just 2 types of ip ranges, 255.255.255.0 for \"small\" companies and 255.0.0.0 for \"big\" companies :)  \ncjdelisle - (10:45): that 255.255.255.0 is called a /24 because 24 of the 32 bits are defined. 255.0.0.0 is a /8, nobody can get a /8 anymore, they gave them out in like 1991.  \ncjdelisle - (10:46): You guys can still get a /24 for like 150\u20ac but arin won't sell anything smaller than a /20.  \ncjdelisle - (10:48): The problem is provide independent space means you announce your (tiny little) range to all of the backbone routers and the global routing tables get so huge they need bigger routers.  \ncjdelisle - (10:50): What's easiest for the backbone is if 192 routes to usa, 64 routes to chicago, 32 routes to some isp and 25 routes to the specific computer. Except 192 range is not like that, 192.64.32.1 might be a computer in chicago and 192.64.33.1 might be in estonia.  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 10:52  \ncjdelisle - (10:57): humpf... \u00a0\u00a0decryption succeeded with wrong password. \u00a0I think it decrypted to garbage but I have to check...  \nabusenius - (10:57): we might want to check if the output == input  \ncjdelisle - (11:00): yup, repeating the test in loop 0-1000  \ncjdelisle - (11:01): if the output is the same length, I think the padding scheme doesn't notice anything is wrong.  \ncjdelisle - (11:01): indeed, I already have a bad decryption.  \nabusenius - (11:03): in theory, a wrong password might decrypt to any meaningful text, but the probability is very very low  \ncjdelisle - (11:04): hmm, actually the key would have to be as long as the original text to decrypt to anything.  \ncjdelisle - (11:05): I remember someone talking about an algorithm which would decrypt to various things based on the password given.  \ncjdelisle - (11:05): It would be pretty obvious to a cryptographer though that there was more to it though.  \nabusenius - (11:06): well, if the key is as long as the text, then you can decrypt to any text of the same length  \nabusenius - (11:07): if the key is shorter, the number of possible decryptions is much smaller  \ncjdelisle - (11:07): But it brings up an interesting topic, if you xor \"illegal data\" against random and publish the random on one server and the output on another, which server gets the takedown notice?  \nabusenius - (11:07): but one of them might still be meaningful  \ncjdelisle - (11:08): It's essentially impossible to determine random from something xor'd against random.  \ncjdelisle - (11:09): 4 collisions.  \nabusenius - (11:09): well, you can easily invent any content you want :)  \nabusenius - (11:09): what yre you encrypting?  \ncjdelisle - (11:10): I just rigged the test to repeat trying to decrypt with the wrong password and dump any time it collides.  \nEnygma` left at 11:10 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \ncjdelisle - (11:10): decryptWithWrongPasswordTest() \\* 1000  \nabusenius - (11:11): so \"collision\" = successfull decryption to garbage?  \ncjdelisle - (11:11): yup.  \ncjdelisle - (11:11): done. 4/1000 tries.  \nabusenius - (11:11): the only way decryption algorithm can distinguish \"meaningful\" text from garbage is the padding  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 11:12  \ncjdelisle - (11:12): IMO it should output garbage every time it fails. Imagine trying to password guess that :D  \nabusenius - (11:12): so if the garbage by chance contains one byte of correct padding, it will succeed  \nabusenius - (11:12): well, you can check for printable character for example  \ncjdelisle - (11:12): yup, check for invalid utf8  \ncjdelisle - (11:13): imagine encrypting an mp3, basically any text is valid in an mp3  \ncjdelisle - (11:13): or mpeg4  \nabusenius - (11:13): there is a header you can trry to match  \nabusenius - (11:14): frames etc.  \nabusenius - (11:14): but it is harder  \nabusenius - (11:14): thats one of the reasons people first compress, then encrypt :)  \ncjdelisle - (11:16): Yea, it would be tough trying to beat this algorithm though, it took like 5 minutes for 2000 cycles of scrypt, I could make it take longer with config too.  \ncjdelisle - (11:27): proposal sent.  \nmangroovie left at 11:29 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \ncjdelisle - (11:41): I don't see the user manager in the sandbox, is it written?

AKA hardcoding document names.  \nabusenius - (11:51): which interface?  \ncjdelisle - (11:53): defined here http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/UsersModule  \nmangroovie joined #xwiki at 11:53  \nvenkatesh left at 11:53 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nabusenius - (11:54): ah, ok  \nabusenius - (11:56): maybe, I \"never ever\" rule is quite unrealistic though  \nabusenius - (11:56): s/I/a/  \ncjdelisle - (11:58): Well that's how all best practices are, sometimes you are just plain painted into a corner.  \ncjdelisle - (11:58): I usually end up throwing away code when that happens.  \nabusenius - (12:01): moved cert storage methods out of crypto, about to commit  \ncjdelisle - (12:01): there was storage in crypto?  \ncjdelisle - (12:02): I don't see it...  \nabusenius - (12:03): well, user document utils were misused for that  \nabusenius - (12:04): I mean listinf fingerprints etc.  \nabusenius - (12:04): \\*listing  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 12:04  \ncjdelisle - (12:04): Oh, I haven't looked there in a while. thanks ;)  \ncjdelisle - (12:04): k I think I know how you can validate a cert.  \ncjdelisle - (12:05): Take the webid and do a http get on it, you'll get the foafssl stuff.  \ncjdelisle - (12:06): We can also set it up so you get a list of signed permissions granted to the user.  \nabusenius - (12:07): yea, we could do that  \ncjdelisle - (12:07): parse those permissions, extract cert from signature, recurse.  \ncjdelisle - (12:08): It will be awesome but slooooooow.  \ncjdelisle - (12:09): hmm, maybe not if the user pages get cached.  \nabusenius - (12:09): the recursion would not be very deep  \nabusenius - (12:09): unless we overdo it :)  \nvenkatna joined #xwiki at 12:10  \nabusenius - (12:10): it should be something like admin -> user permission -> cert  \ncjdelisle - (12:10): What's awesome about it is I can be on one wiki and give you permission on another, you can then give permissions to people on my wiki.  \nvenkatesh left at 12:10 (Ping timeout: 248 seconds  \nabusenius - (12:11): not that everybody was waiting to do that all their life, but yea, would be possible :)  \ncjdelisle - (12:12): I don't expect anyone beating a path to the door for it but I can see in the future there might be applications.  \ncjdelisle - (12:13): If I grant admin authority to an admin of another wiki, all of their wiki's users get defacto permissions on mine.  \ncjdelisle - (12:15): the escaping test makes a nice DoS engine.  \nabusenius - (12:16): :)  \ncjdelisle - (12:17): Have you seen Websecurity?  \nabusenius - (12:18): not sure what you mean  \nabusenius - (12:18): afk for lunch  \ncjdelisle - (12:19): http://www.websecurify.com/  \ncjdelisle - (12:19): I'll go find something to eat too.  \nflorinciu1 joined #xwiki at 12:39  \nflorinciu left at 12:44 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nflorinciu1 left at 12:46 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 12:47  \nsylviarusu joined #xwiki at 12:56  \nflorinciu left at 13:05 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 13:08  \ntmortagne - (13:10): cjdelisle: i'm not sure i understand what you mean in XWIKI-5390  \ncjdelisle - (13:10): http://maven.xwiki.org/site/xwiki-core-parent/xwiki-core/apidocs/com/xpn/xwiki/api/package-summary.html  \ncjdelisle - (13:11): all still version 1.7  \ntmortagne - (13:12): cjdelisle: there is a hudson project for it already, that's http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform-core-site-job/ but it has been disabled some time ago because we had issue with javadoc plugin think  \ntmortagne - (13:12): s/think/I think/  \ncjdelisle - (13:13): I see, I can try to see if I can get it working again.  \ntmortagne - (13:13): yep  \ncjdelisle - (13:13): It's pretty important because that's the only place to get javadoc for XWikiDocument etc.  \ntmortagne - (13:14): cjdelisle: well there is m2Eclipse automatically downloading javadoc/source too ;)  \ntmortagne - (13:14): which is very usefull  \ntmortagne - (13:15): but it's only for released projects  \ncjdelisle - (13:15): When I wrote the DevGuide.Scripting I had to reference some javadoc so I chose that.  \ncjdelisle - (13:15): Because it's hosted.  \ncjdelisle - (13:16): If I can get this working then I see no reason to keep uploading .zip files to xwiki.org so that will close another issue.  \ncjdelisle - (13:16): Make any sense?  \ntmortagne - (13:17): cjdelisle: it's not the same thing  \ntmortagne - (13:17): this job deploy trunk jaavadoc  \ntmortagne - (13:17): in xwiki.org we provide specific releases javadoc  \ncjdelisle - (13:17): hmm. good point.

I mean .. understanding that technical paper and then implementing  \ncjdelisle - (14:08): re scrypt?  \nsburjan - (14:08): We had to implement DES and AES from specs like these..and it was HORRIBLE  \nsburjan - (14:08): yes  \ncjdelisle - (14:08): It wasn't too bad because there was a reference implementation in c  \nsburjan - (14:09): oh, so you didn;t wrote if from scratch  \ncjdelisle - (14:09): It definitly is not AES.  \nsburjan - (14:09): it's stronger than AES, right  \nsburjan - (14:09): AES is totally hard (at least for me)  \ncjdelisle - (14:09): It does something different.  \nsburjan - (14:09): yeah, I know  \ncjdelisle - (14:10): The point is that there is no way to go from the password to the key without using x amount of ram for y cpu cycles of time.  \ncjdelisle - (14:10): Fortunately it uses PBKCS2 which I could rip from bouncycastle.  \nsburjan - (14:10): but basically this is a much more complex hash function, right ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:11): yup.  \nsburjan - (14:11): md5 is birthday paradox vulnerable  \nsburjan - (14:11): I guess this isn;t :)  \ncjdelisle - (14:11): It uses PBKCS2, and it uses salsa20  \ncjdelisle - (14:11): ahh, PBKCS2(Sha-256) :)  \ncjdelisle - (14:12): yea md5 is bad.  \nsburjan - (14:12): oh :))  \nsburjan - (14:12): md5 is obsolete  \nsburjan - (14:12): intresting  \nsburjan - (14:12): I never understood properly \u00a0the algebra behind crypto systems  \nsburjan - (14:13): although i wanted to :)  \ncjdelisle - (14:13): This isn't really crypto.  \ncjdelisle - (14:13): It's just designed to take a long time.  \ncjdelisle - (14:13): So it generates an absurd amount of data. Then it takes an int from 4 bytes of a hash output and gets the data at the location of that int.  \ncjdelisle - (14:14): The idea is you can't safely throw away any of that data because you might need it.  \nsburjan - (14:14): I see  \nsburjan - (14:14): so this happens for all the new passwords ?  \nsburjan - (14:14): new user accounts, etc ?  \nsburjan - (14:15): I nea this happens for every password  \ncjdelisle - (14:15): So it keeps seeding the hash with pieces of the big block of data, then it takes the output and feeds it to PBKDF2 again.  \nsburjan - (14:15): \\*mean  \ncjdelisle - (14:16): No it it's just a service at the moment, once I convince everyone to include it in the tree, then we can think about using it for the user accounts.  \nsburjan - (14:16): so what do you hash with these service more exactly ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:16): Passwords.  \nsburjan - (14:16): so only user passwords. or are there another type of passwords ?  \nsburjan - (14:17): that are used in xwiki  \ncjdelisle - (14:17): It is intended to be useable for the user accounts, I just want to put the code there before we even talk about implementing it for user passwords.  \ncjdelisle - (14:17): Sure, any password can be handles by this.  \nsburjan - (14:17): I see  \ncjdelisle - (14:17): s/handles/handled/  \nabusenius - (14:17): btw, XWIKI-70 is the oldest bug (i.e. not feature request or task) atm  \nsburjan - (14:18): so it is collision free ? or you made it like this in order to take as far as possible advante of collisions  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 14:18  \ncjdelisle - (14:18): It is as collision resistant as pbkdf2(sha256)  \ncjdelisle - (14:19): because the password is included in the final hash.  \nsburjan - (14:19): yeah, but the time to find another string that hashes the same... \u00a0requires much more time due to y ram and x cpu cycles, right ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:20): Well the main attack vector is password guessing with word lists.  \ncjdelisle - (14:20): so it's not really a collision but the real password that is most likely to be found.  \nsburjan - (14:20): hmmm  \nsburjan - (14:21): dictionary attack ? :)  \ncjdelisle - (14:21): This makes it difficult because it occupies 1MB of ram for about 100milliseconds.  \nsburjan - (14:21): i see  \ncjdelisle - (14:21): These numbers are configurable.  \nsburjan - (14:21): but the actual auth mechanism is comparing the hash from db with the hash(typed password), right ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:21): The default scrypt takes 200MB for 5 seconds.  \nsburjan - (14:22): like md5 is still used  \ncjdelisle - (14:22): It's a little more complicated than that, but that's the idea.  \nsburjan - (14:22): I see  \ncjdelisle - (14:22): You have a PasswordVerificationFunction which is Serializable and includes all of the information to recreate the same output given the same password.  \ncjdelisle - (14:23): that is the salt, the memory cost number, and the processor cost number.  \nsburjan - (14:23): yeah..  \nsburjan - (14:23): intresting  \ncjdelisle - (14:24): So you load the code from the database, deserialize, and feed it the password to validate.  \ncjdelisle - (14:24): If we decide in the future to change the function, all we need to do is create a new function and start using it for all new passwords.  \nsburjan - (14:24): so each password is serialized in an object that is stored in the db ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:25): the ourtput from hashing the password is a byte[] in the object yes.  \nsburjan - (14:25): I see  \nsburjan - (14:25): pretty cool  \ncjdelisle - (14:26): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/contrib/sandbox/xwiki-crypto/src/main/java/org/xwiki/crypto/passwd/internal/ScryptMemoryHardKeyDerivationFunction.java  \nsburjan - (14:26): and what is the memory and cpu cost going in the ecuation?  \nsburjan - (14:26): when \"hashing\" the inputed password in order to compare it from the serialized object ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:27): Configurable, but I have it set to 1Mb for 100ms by default.  \nsburjan - (14:28): yeas, but what operation is slowed down intensionally with the ram and CPU thing ?  \ncjdelisle - (14:28): indeed, you can't have everything :)  \nboscop\\_ is now known as boscop ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nsburjan - (14:30): no no .. where is the slow down come in place ?  \nsburjan - (14:30): this this slows down .. you wanted this.. cpu cycles, etc  \ncjdelisle - (14:31): ?  \nsburjan - (14:32): you force the system to work in time. to be limited by ram and CPU  \nsburjan - (14:32): not to take advance of the full computational powers of a possible attacker  \ncjdelisle - (14:32): If the system is under heavy load when the user registers, then their crypted password will be weaker.  \ncjdelisle - (14:33): decrypting the password will always take the same amount of cpu cycles.  \nsburjan - (14:33): oh  \nsburjan - (14:33): so decrypting is the operation that takes advantage of the intentional slowness  \nsburjan - (14:33): got it  \ncjdelisle - (14:34): When crypting the password, It does a test run to get the desired number of cycles from the desired time to crypt.  \ncjdelisle - (14:34): It's not all that accurate but within 100% according to the tests.  \nsburjan - (14:35): I see  \ncjdelisle - (14:35): I noticed it usually takes a little more time than it is asked to take.  \nsburjan - (14:36): and isnt there a disk if someone tries a dictionary attack to block the server (DDOS) due to heavy platform load in order to decrypt the passwd ?  \nsburjan - (14:36): \\*risk, not disk  \ncjdelisle - (14:37): Well if you're trying to ddos the server then you can use infinite loops etc. if you are trying to guess the password, then you want a graphics processor.  \ncjdelisle - (14:37): Anyway if you have a botnet (DDoS) then you can get thousands of windows boxes to try passwords locally.  \ncjdelisle - (14:39): However I think you can cease up an xwiki installation just by trying to log in with a million threads right now.  \ncjdelisle - (14:41): bbiab...  \ntmortagne left at 14:43 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 14:43  \nsburjan - (14:46): wait, you lost me :)  \nsburjan - (14:47): the decrypt function is GPU dependant ?  \nMartinCleaver joined #xwiki at 14:57  \nabusenius - (14:59): sburjan: he is talking about using GPGPU to speedup breaking hashes  \nsburjan - (15:01): so it uses graphics card to break hashes ?  \nabusenius - (15:01): the bad guys use them  \nsburjan - (15:01): I;m a little bit confused  \nsburjan - (15:01): yeah, the bad guys  \nabusenius - (15:01): yes, 1000 threads are better than 4  \nsburjan - (15:02): a gpu has 1000 threads ?  \nabusenius - (15:02): new ones yes  \nsburjan - (15:02): I see  \nabusenius - (15:02): light-weight threads  \nsburjan - (15:02): and the other thing I didn't understand  \nsburjan - (15:02): Anyway if you have a botnet (DDoS) then you can get thousands of windows boxes to try passwords locally.  \nsburjan - (15:03): but how do you get locally the serialized objects that contain the passwdz ?  \nabusenius - (15:03): well, assuming you have DB dump or something  \nsburjan - (15:03): but for that you already need privileges  \nabusenius - (15:03): sure  \nabusenius - (15:04): the idea is, if the attacker can get access to the server, he still can't find out your password  \nabusenius - (15:05): otherwise you might as well just sleep(10) on the server side  \nabusenius - (15:06): having a password in cleartext is bad, because people reuse them for example  \ncjdelisle - (15:06): privileges lol. All you need for database dumps is bobby tables.  \ncjdelisle - (15:06): we're better than some but never trust the db.  \ncjdelisle - (15:07): Actually, the password hashes are right in the XWikiUsers object.  \nsburjan - (15:07): bobby tables ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:08): http://xkcd.com/327/  \ncjdelisle - (15:09): It's a dumb joke but it has sort of turned into a meme.  \nsburjan - (15:09): yea :))  \nsburjan - (15:09): but we're still vulnerable to sql injection ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:10): hmmmmmmm yes.  \nmflorea left at 15:11 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa left at 15:13 (Quit: Leaving.  \ncjdelisle - (15:13): We're looking into a way to use encryption to make it so sql injection is pointless.  \nsburjan - (15:14): parameterization doesnt work in our case ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:14): If everything used it then it would work. I'm talking about cases where there is a registered user and he has access to searchDocuments etc.  \nsburjan - (15:15): and making them be used everywhere is hard ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:16): Well even if they are used everywhere all the adversary has to do is register and write their own vulnerable queries.  \ncjdelisle - (15:19): We have been talking about having a root \"superadmin\" certificate stored in a file on the hard disk. That cert signs the admin's permissions and the admin signs the user permissions.  \ncjdelisle - (15:20): you can dump (or alter) the database but all you get is certificates and password encrypted private keys  \ncjdelisle - (15:20): change a cert, break the cert chain, change a key, then it doesn't match the cert.  \ncjdelisle - (15:38): oh sburjan Cryptography (at least public key RSA) works because it's fast to raise something to the 65537th power and slow to get the 65537th root.  \ncjdelisle - (15:39): that's the \"one way trap function\"  \nsylviarusu left at 15:40 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan - (15:43): I see  \nsburjan - (15:43): I started to read more about sql injection  \nsburjan - (15:43): too bad that htere isn;t a \"training\" site :)  \nsburjan - (15:43): so I can actually see it work  \nabusenius - (15:44): try xwiki.org ^^  \ncjdelisle - (15:45): lol  \nsburjan - (15:45): i'm sure it's not vulnerable :))  \nsburjan - (15:45): you guys fixed it  \nsburjan - (15:45): :D  \nsburjan - (15:45): at least the most vital places  \ncjdelisle - (15:45): actually yea, you'd just end up spamming zipe's logs with your attempts.  \ncjdelisle - (15:45): \\*xipe  \ncjdelisle - (15:46): Do you have a local installation on your computer?  \nsburjan - (15:46): of XWiki ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:46): yea.  \nsburjan - (15:46): of course  \nsburjan - (15:46): I'm writing automatic tests, so i have to test them :P  \ncjdelisle - (15:47): Well you can play with that. Try using websecurity against it, just run it over night and see what you get  \nabusenius - (15:47): sburjan, there are training apps actually, http://insecurewebapp.sourceforge.net/main/index.html  \nsburjan - (15:48): hmmm  \nsburjan - (15:48): I'll take a look  \ncjdelisle - (15:49): http://labs.oracle.com/projects/crypto/HowECCWorks-USLetter.pdf  \ncjdelisle - (15:50): McEllice is a bit more interesting because it can't be parallelized (quantum computer proof) but it's also a lot more complicated.  \nsburjan - (15:50): lots of math :)  \nsburjan - (15:50): so this is what your srypto implementation use ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:51): it doesn't use any public key (not for password derivation.)  \nsburjan - (15:52): cjdelisle, : do you have some masters in computer security ? :)  \nsburjan - (15:52): I know abusenius has  \ncjdelisle - (15:52): xwiki-crypto does have a public key component, it just uses rsa.  \ncjdelisle - (15:52): haha masters in what?  \nsburjan - (15:52): information security :)  \nsburjan - (15:53): computer security  \ncjdelisle - (15:53): I took like 2 semesters of programming in college.  \nabusenius - (15:53): there are no special security degrees afaik  \nsburjan - (15:54): abusenius, : There are masters in all the europe on Information/Computer Security  \nabusenius - (15:54): not in my university :) one can just specialize on that  \ncjdelisle - (15:54): My professors were all ex-nsa, one recommended I apply there.  \nsburjan - (15:54): they teach you the algebra behind the cryptosystems  \nabusenius - (15:54): it is still called \"computer science\"  \nsburjan - (15:55): things like chinese remainder theorem  \ncjdelisle - (15:55): Yea, I read about it a little, I'm sure I'll \u00a0learn it sooner or later.  \nabusenius - (15:56): we got this in the introduction lecture to crypto  \nsburjan - (15:56): abusenius, : but your internship is in Security here at X, right ?  \nabusenius - (15:56): yes  \ncjdelisle - (15:57): hey, I have a masters in breakeology.  \nsburjan - (15:57): so you learned the security stuff all by yourself ?  \nabusenius - (15:57): me?  \nsburjan - (15:57): yes, you abusenius \u00a0:)  \ncjdelisle - (15:57): breakeology, when you learn by breaking stuff.  \nsburjan - (15:57): breakeology is like .. sociology, antropology ? :))  \nsburjan - (15:58): so you do have a masters in that :D  \nabusenius - (15:58): no, I've learned everything I could find, but I also took all lectures on crypto/security we have  \nabusenius - (15:58): if you're interested in something, it happens naturally :)  \nsburjan - (15:59): true  \nsburjan - (15:59): but that math is pretty hard :))  \nsburjan - (15:59): all the modulo stuff  \nsburjan - (15:59): remainders, etc  \ncjdelisle - (15:59): I have 5 pdfs in my system tray.  \nsburjan - (15:59): about ?  \nsburjan - (16:00): security ?  \ncjdelisle - (16:00): How to get ips, DDoS defense, anycast, conficker, and ecc.  \nsburjan - (16:00): they should make a book on crypto. Computer Security for retards. and they should dedicate it to me :))  \nsburjan - (16:01): Well known idiot's guide is too high level .. I need something lower  \nabusenius - (16:01): :D  \ncjdelisle - (16:01): hah, I noticed that the math all just looks hard with the weird symbols, read the implementation if you want to understand.  \ncjdelisle - (16:01): Look at this: http://cr.yp.to/salsa20.html  \nabusenius - (16:02): I find probability theory harder, groups are not that bad  \ncjdelisle - (16:02): salsa20 is a full cipher implementation in 22 lines. that is why Bernstein is full of win.  \ncjdelisle - (16:03): no stupid s-boxes, no obfuscation. it's either secure or it's not and that doesn't really depend on how hard it is to understand.  \nabusenius - (16:04): thats just because it doesn't include the implementation of the hash function ;)  \ncjdelisle - (16:04): yea well it's actually a cipher. Converting it to a hash which is collision resistant and such is a bigger task.  \ncjdelisle - (16:05): but that function placed well in the eurocrypt contest.  \nabusenius - (16:09): in any case, understanding what you can do (and what not) with some type of encryption is more important than implementation details  \ncjdelisle - (16:10): Yea, the devil really is in the details.  \ncjdelisle - (16:12): I remember reading that people were surprised when joanna rutkowska showed that a computer with full disk encryption can still be attacked by putting malware in the mbr.  \nabusenius - (16:12): less related question, how can I change log4j settings of xwiki instance I use for escaping-tests/  \nabusenius - (16:12): ?  \nabusenius - (16:13): it seems to use debug logging level  \ncjdelisle - (16:14): take a look at start-wiki and start-wiki-debug.sh there might be something there about it.  \nabusenius - (16:15): hm, not really  \ncjdelisle - (16:16): I don't know, you could google log4j \"-D\"  \ncjdelisle - (16:17): I'm sure there is a -Dsomething which will change it.  \nabusenius - (16:18): googling...  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 16:20  \nsburjan - (16:21): in java a char is 2 bytes, right ? so a 64 bytes string is actually a 32 char string ?  \ncjdelisle - (16:22): yes a char is two bytes :/  \nsburjan - (16:23): in the link you gave me , it says that it takes a 64 bytes strin. about salsa20  \ncjdelisle - (16:23): String has a few other components which occupy some space but you're pretty much correct.  \nsburjan - (16:23): but if the input string is less than 64 bytes/32 chars ? it's getting padded ?  \ncjdelisle - (16:24): Well the function will run on much larger pieces of data by breaking them up, and yes it pads at the end.  \ncjdelisle - (16:26): The neat thing about salsa is it's auto seeking. You give it a key and say block 1000, then you input 1000 along with the key and salt, and it generates some output which you can use to decrypt the data.  \ncjdelisle - (16:27): salsa20 doesn't actually decrypt your data, it generates psudorandom which you then xor against your data.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:28  \nsburjan - (16:28): hmmm  \nsburjan - (16:28): so it can be decrypted  \nsburjan - (16:29): afaik md5 is one way hash  \nsburjan - (16:29): alsa is reversible ?  \ncjdelisle - (16:29): yea.  \ncjdelisle - (16:29): Imagine you take a key and md5 it.  \nsburjan - (16:29): oh... big diffrence  \ncjdelisle - (16:30): Actually imagine you take a key, append a number (0) then md5 it.  \ncjdelisle - (16:30): then you take your plain text and xor it against the output from md5.  \nsburjan - (16:31): this is how you decrypt it ?  \ncjdelisle - (16:31): If you have more plaintext, you take your key again, and append 1 and md5 it.  \ncjdelisle - (16:31): xor that against the ramining plaintext.  \ncjdelisle - (16:31): to decrypt, you take the key, append 0, md5.  \nsburjan - (16:31): intresting.

They are frequently used in data centers where multiple servers are placed in a single rack \u00a0with a single keyboard, monitor and mouse. A KVM switch then allows data center personnel to connect to any server in the rack.
