I'd like that work to continue so that we can introduce the new XWiki Syntax 2.1  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually we don't want to change it completely in term of content  \n11:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0fair enough. are there any plans on what it will look like?  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0more in term of L&F  \n11:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0L&F?  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0look and feel  \n11:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0right  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there were a few suggestions  \n11:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, i could probably work on it  \n11:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but you'd have to tell me what you expect  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah that would be great  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me fish the link  \n11:36\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cool  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://xwiki.markmail.org/thread/ojrswk4kdoosekqa  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could reply to that thread  \n11:37\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0also, in the current wiki on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax#HLinks (note the section) we see one of them nasty little smileys ;)  \n11:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0jstoldt: what do you mean \"leave here\" ?  \n11:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sould prolly be better to use [ ] instead of ( ) there anyway... to me ( ) suggests content and not placeholder  \n11:38\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sburjan: i'm only an internee and i'll finish my internship at the end of february  \n11:39\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so from that point on i will no longer be able to maintain the wiki instance i built in this department  \n11:39\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well yes, but you can still join this chan and use XWiki :)  \n11:39\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0that i can do if i find enough time between my various other activities ;)  \n11:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0need to power down right now  \n11:41\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0be back in half an hour or so  \n11:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n11:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0re  \n12:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:48\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:54\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0vmassol: regarding the syntax page, i read through the thread and i checked out the two proposals  \n12:55\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0this is all nice and good but what i wonder about is, since there is no decision on which way to go, how should i proceed if i were to rework the entire syntax page in one rather swift action?  \n13:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: you could resurrect the thread by replying, stating what you prefer and what action you'd like to do  \n13:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ok, i shall do that  \n13:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO the newest proposal is the best. IMO we could also use the new vertical menu that sergiu is introducing for the admin/profile UI  \n13:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i agree, i prefere it, too  \n13:04\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0about additional menus and whatnot, i'm really only conerned about the content and its layout, if that's okay  \n13:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Improvements/Administration#HVerticalTabs  \n13:04\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0don't want to interfere with code decissions too much unless bugs are concerned ;)  \n13:05\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0menu looks nice but, IMO, it does not work too well with the colibri skin with that style  \n13:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think a global syntax chooser was also discussed, which I think I'd like too  \n13:05\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0most certainly!  \n13:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in term of implementation I'd see it as 3 pages  \n13:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one per syntax  \n13:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01.0, 2.0, 2.1  \n13:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually one page per syntax category would be ok too  \n13:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:09\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:16\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0am i understanding you correctly, you propose to split the different syntaxes among different documents?  \n13:17\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0because i think it would be benefitial to use one document, like in the mockup right now  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: hi. I've noticed something. Using ##{{{something}}}## in syntax 2.0 doesn't display in monospace. I think it's our CSS rules. Do you think you could look into that?  \n13:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0in fact, what i would really like would be something that would basically be using the current syntax when writing and then displays optionally  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: personally I like this: http://confluence.atlassian.com/renderer/notationhelp.action?section=all  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie the ability to see them all in a page + the ability to see only a specific syntax topic  \n13:19\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, that's nice for getting an overview  \n13:19\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but i was talking about the different syntaxes just now  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes several documents is better because one is just unmaintainable, too large  \n13:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ not all syntaxes may be avail in a given wiki  \n13:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like using divs to show and hide particular columns and/or subsections  \n13:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0read about div here: http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=504504  \n13:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0;)  \n13:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0what bugs me most about having one document for each syntax is that inevitably their layout and/or wording will differ  \n13:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0unless somebody really takes his time when modifying the page  \n13:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i'd really like to have something like the current syntax page, only with some good filtering  \n13:22\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0vmassol: the tt monospace- yes the style is causing it - the problem is that is custom added so the code fixed something - I'll try to look at it  \n13:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0WDYT?  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: ok thanks. I'll create a jira issue now  \n13:25\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0vmassol: what do you think about the rendering? is it ok? <p><tt><tt class=\"wikimodel-verbatim\">something</tt></tt></p> ? there are two <tt> tags nested  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XSCOLIBRI-265  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: would you suggest something else? ## generates <tt> and {{{ generates <tt class=\"\u2026\">  \n13:26\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0vmassol: because the tt has the monospace style .. but the tt.wikimodel-verbatim overrides the font-family  \n13:27\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0I mean why are there 2 tt ? one simple and one with a class.. for something simple like that ?  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe <pre> (if it's valid in xhtml)  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becuase as I said  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one is for monospace  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and one for verbatim  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to map this to html  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it was chosen to use <tt> and <tt class=\"\u2026\" in the past for some reason  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we could modify that if we agree  \n13:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0<pre> is not allowed inline  \n13:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's a block element  \n13:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that \u00a0all this was discussed on the list  \n13:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember all the details though  \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok sdumitriu that's a good point  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: I don't see why tt.wikimodel-verbatim would need to override the font-family  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you see a need?  \n13:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0verbatim shouldn't care with style  \n13:39\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0it was added with the CSS Cleanup ...
