Is there any way I can help solve http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/ADMINTOOL-11 ? It's kind of blocking a project of ours. :)  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tillo: we can help you fix it  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe the problem is here https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-admintools/blob/master/src/main/resources/Admin/ExportPage.xml#L39  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and a Document Reference should be used instead  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem I think is that the user picks a full name instead of picking a space + a page name  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is what I see at https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-admintools/blob/master/src/main/resources/Admin/ExportPage.xml#L30  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the UI needs needs to be modified to let the user specify both the space + page name  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise if you have A.B.C you can't guess if:  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- space = A.B, page = C  \n14:09\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Would it be the same bug as exporting an entire space?  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- soace = A, page = B.C  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*space  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that I have \\*never\\* used nor read the source of this app  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not maintained by any of us here  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I have no idea what you mean by \"same bug as exporting an entire space\" :)  \n14:11\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0I meant using Export instead of ExportPage  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what does export do?  \n14:11\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0You can select multiple pages/spaces as far as I know.  \n14:11\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0That should bring both the space and the name.  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I guess export calls exportPage  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the code is here btw: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-admintools/tree/master/src/main/resources/Admin  \n14:11\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Yeah \u00a0I guessed so too  \n14:12\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Since a Space can't have dots, would it be a better fix to split at the first dot instead of the last one?  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually tmortagne seems to have participated to this app a bit ;)  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a space \\*can\\* have dots  \n14:12\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Oh  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I never works on export part of admin tools no  \n14:13\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Then you are right, I've to look for the same bug within Export.xml or, if it's using ExportPage.xml, fix it there.  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I always use http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Large+Wiki+Export  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you're mentioned on https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-admintools/blob/master/src/main/resources/Admin/Export.xml ;)  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's why I mentioned your name)  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0apparently you just did some formatting ;)  \n14:14\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0tmortagne: I don't know if my colleague know about that project or if it rejected it because it did not met the requirements. I'll check with him.  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tillo: would be nice to tell us about your reqs indeed  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since there might be other ways of achieving what you need  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep would be easier to know your need and XWiki version too  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Large+Wiki+Export is configurable but its a bit of rough  \n14:16\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Yes, he's currently looking into it. He says he rejected it because he wasn't able to choose specific groups of pages or spaces, as far as he can remember.  \n14:17\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Did it evolute lately?  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no advanced UI for it but you can provide the where part of a SQL request  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you can select anything you want that way  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Something to put after 'select distinct doc.fullName from XWikiDocument as doc' basically\"  \n14:19\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0That's great. That query is directly accessible or a new page calling it is required?  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the other way is to simply export it all and remove what you don't want in the XAR  \n14:19\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0That I remember was out of the question because of the size.  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the request is a field in the UI  \n14:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Large+Wiki+Export has been made to export wikis of any size  \n14:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what version of XWiki is it ?  \n14:20\u00a0<tillo>\u00a04.4.1  \n14:20\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0At least the \"guest\" pages, don't know about the rest.  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n14:24\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Ok I'm blocking some of his time to look at this project again and try either to modify the request or doing a selection on import.  \n14:24\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0If that's not working we'll be back later this week. Thank you !  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tillo: I was not really talking about import  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a XAR is just a zip with the pages, you can remove there anything you want  \n14:29\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Would it remove attachments, or are they easy to spot?  \n14:30\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0them\\*  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0each page (and its attachments) are located in a XML file in the XAR  \n14:30\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Then I'll add that to the task note. Thanks.  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and each space is represented by a folder in the XAR with the XML pages in it  \n14:31\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Nice.  \n14:31\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0what is best document identifier a for using as key in hashmap? fullname?  \n14:31\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Also the destination version would be 6.0 or higher. Would not be a problem right?  \n14:35\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: well it all depend what is unique in your map exactly  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tillo: that should not be a problem no  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: XWikiDocument#getId() does not take into accound the wiki  \n14:38\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: document has to be unique in whole wiki (in all subwikis) and it has to be recoverable (i need to obtain document from that key), because documentreference can be different instance when searching for that in hashmap, i guess stringifying documentreference should be good, right?  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0meaning that two similar document in two different wikis might have the same id  \n14:38\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0since it returns something like subwiki:Documents.Sandbox  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0be carefull with that, each language of a document is a different document with the same reference  \n14:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but of you don't care about translations it's fine  \n14:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, great  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0another possibility is to use the DocumentReference directly as key  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless you absolutely want your map to use String as key  \n14:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yeah, i was using DocumentReference as a key now, but i'm not sure if it would work without any issue (for example when obtaining documentreference for the same document, but it will be diferent instance, that could cause misbehaving and not obtaining values... also that documentreference will be held \"forever\" -> until wiki restart)  \n14:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DocumentReference is not very big but yes a bit bigger than a String and you should not have any more issues that with it's String representation  \n14:46\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ok then, i will have the document reference for now, i will test it later if it causes some issues  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DocumentReference are not modifiable if that's what you worry about  \n14:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:31\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0maven question (vmassol, tmortagne, anyone): I`m trying to execute this plugin http://hastebin.com/aficinocuw.xml betwrrn step 3 and 4 here https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/blob/master/xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/pom.xml#L73 but, no matter what I do, it is always executed before step 3.  \n15:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the plugin and step 3 run in the same phase, but even if they are listed in the <plugins> section as first step 3 and then my plugin, the <plugins> order is ignored and my plugin always gets executed after step 3.  \n15:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0using maven 3.0.4 and now 3.0.5  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: no idea if the order is supposed to be respected officially  \n15:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I found that it is supposed to be respected  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that would be my first reflex too  \n15:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0http://www.mkyong.com/maven/maven-plugin-execution-order-in-same-phase/ and others  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you are sure you are executing that with maven 3.0.5 ?  \n15:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes... was using 3.0.4 first and now I have installed 3.0.5  \n15:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you could try with more recent version of Maven maybe, if it's definitely a bug in 3.0.5 I guess we can try to speed up a bit our support of Maven 3.1+  \n15:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, let me try the latest maven...  \n15:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0same with 3.2.2 :|  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I also confirm that dependency plugin phase is pre-integration-test at least  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so looks like http://www.mkyong.com/maven/maven-plugin-execution-order-in-same-phase/ is not so true  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0try to generate an effective pom  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see if the order does not change for some reason  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0could be because we are using maven-resources-plugin several times  \n15:55\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0hmm, indeed, through black magic, the order is reversed in the effective pom  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0try to explicitely put an id to the first one  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't have an id in the effective pom for the other one  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's defined in enterprise-test  \n15:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for the other maven-resources-plugin execution, right?  \n15:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n15:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0because indeed, there are 2 executions and maybe the grouping messes things up  \n15:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since the first one does not have an id maybe it's a bit lost  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's not it I don't have other idea :)  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's working you should probably put ids on all the plugins in enterprise-test  \n16:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0same result :(  \n16:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0defined an Id in enterprise-test and used it in enterprise-test-ui  \n16:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0effective pom is still grouped  \n16:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and execution is still in the unwanted order  \n16:03\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0is now known as <cjd>  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: you end up with both execution in the same <plugin> ?  \n16:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0in effective, yes  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm wondering if that's not actually something standard in Maven  \n16:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I get resources plugin, with 2 executions, each with their ID and phase and then I get the dependency plugin  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(that you have to put all <execution> in the same <plugin>)  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I remember having issues like this like only the first one being taken into account  \n16:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that would not really be an ordering issue but more automatic merge with parent  \n16:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I find it reasonable that the executions are merged into one...  \n16:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but how then can you control the order in which plugins execute inside a phase?  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did you try to put both maven-resources-plugin after the maven-dependency-plugin ?  \n16:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if the effective pom \"corrects\" any ordering you might have applied  \n16:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0trying...  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it had to merge execution it has to pick one  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and I guess it just pick the first one  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not really like reordering  \n16:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0heh, that worked :)  \n16:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it does make sense by that judgmenet, but the process is more or less flawed :)  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well it makes sense if Maven force all execution to be in the same <plugin>  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when if find a new one it adds it to the first it found  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(even if I don't really see the point in merging all execution...)  \n16:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but that just looks like an early optimisation :)  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not very usefull, it's not event the same goals so not the same classes to load  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/event/even/  \n16:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it also messes up the readability of the pom.xml  \n16:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when instead of the natural order, you clump everything at the end...  \n16:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea it's not very nice  \n16:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0now, I`m not very sure, but it also seems that if in pluginManagement I have defined 2 executions but in plugins I use only 1, both seem to be executed  \n16:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0how do I execute just one execution for a plugin?  \n16:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this should be just one execution, right? http://hastebin.com/vunaxalebi.xml  \n16:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: I added a comment in http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10545  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: pluginManagement act for the whole plugin, you are allows to override one of the execution using the id but I don't think not repeating an execution mean you won't have it  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you will have to overwrite the one you don't want I think and disable it some way  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0many goal have a \"skip\" properties  \n16:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0hm, I see... well, that was just a curiosity for the moment  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/properties/property/  \n16:35\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:56\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:04\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems we found someone using markdown in xwiki: https://twitter.com/MarcAudefroy/status/489064444865957890 ;)  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and an answer :)  \n17:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0me  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Keph is you?
