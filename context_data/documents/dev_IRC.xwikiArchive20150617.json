Is anyone here familiar with the LDAP group cache? I'm having trouble with ldap group-to-xwiki group mappings.  \n17:15\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Also thanks in advance. You guys have been really helpful in answering my questions.  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0eromano: what is you question about LDAP group cache ?  \n17:19\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks for the quick reply - is there a delay between changing the cfg file for the group mappings and when that mapping takes place? I kept ldap group sync to always for sync on every login.  \n17:19\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0The problem is that upon logging in, it doesn't look like a user it being added to their mapped group. LDAP side of things looks okay (its a static group)  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0eromano: when you modify the cfg file you have to restart for it to be take into account anyway  \n17:20\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Yeah, I did that.  \n17:20\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Oh. Duh. That means the cache definitely clears. Hmm.  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the cache is a memory cache so when you restart it's reseted  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it would have been stored or somethin but not here)  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/could/could/  \n17:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/would/could/  \n17:21\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0If a group mapping fails for whatever reason, would it be in the log somewhere?  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0eromano: I don't think so, but you would get it in the LDAP debug log  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(as in http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication#HEnableLDAPdebuglog)  \n17:34\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:38\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Hmmm. I enabled all the LDAP components log levels to trace, and I see the authentication when I log in, but nothing on the group assignment.  \n17:39\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Oh wait, I take that back.  \n17:40\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Groupmapping found [XWiki.XWikiMHWiki\\_Sensitive] [[cn=MHWiki\\_Sensitive,o=redacted.redacted.com]]  \n17:40\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0Yet, the user doesn't appear in the group list.  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0eromano: this log is not about the group members, it's just printing the mapping from the configuration  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that the group members resolve will only be done the first time, then it will be take from the cache  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you need to get the log for the very first auth  \n17:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<gdelhumeau\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:10\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:22\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:50\u00a0<eromano>\u00a0has quit  \n21:20\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:27\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:43\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n21:52\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:00\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:08\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:39\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n22:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n22:44\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has quit  \n22:54\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n23:42\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:52\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit\n"}
