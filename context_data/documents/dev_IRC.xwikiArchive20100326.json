They can make the user send lots of fake data but the ISPs are still going to convert plain old DNS to DNSSEC.  \nnpm - (20:19): what i find interesting is that most design patterns are really just a workaround to bad language features. for example the \"proxy pattern\" is totally idiotic -- you simply don't need it if you can pass first class functions as parameters ( http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2008/081408-torvalds-security-circus.html )  \nnpm - (20:19): oops wrong link  \nnpm - (20:20): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy\\_pattern (note they don't have any dynamic langs for the proxy pattern -- because the proxy pattern in a dynamic lang is a one-liner that you don't even need to think about  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:22): Oh yes because of the \"little known\" fact that you can hold multiple references to a single object and it won't consume more memory. Correct?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:23): I see some value in proxies for security (block this function, redirect that one...)  \nnpm - (20:26): Here's a good article on this: http://www.tiagoluchini.eu/2007/07/28/strategy-pattern-comparing-java-x-lisp/  \nnpm - (20:26): i think i should have used strategy pattern \u00a0in my example... in fact i was probably thinking of that more than \"proxy\"...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:28): they double sanitized &lt; \u00a0it seems like there ought to be \"smart\" escapes which will detect already escaped stuff and skip it.  \nnpm - (20:29): the article is good in that it shows how wasteful the entire pattern \"concept\" is... and the pages of code and bugs it causses...... is replaced by a simple language feature that eliminates the need for contorting yourself into a \"pattern\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:32): I get the idea that patterns are often fads like we had object oriented until people realized that everyone makes incompatible objects.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:35): Of course we still use objects but they aren't touted as the savior of programming, now it's components and later it will probably be something else.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:38): Re Javascript: I have changed my opinion on it somewhat after discovering that the whole firefox ui is written in it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:40): It's thread handling is horrible, it's full of \"surprise that's asynchronous\" traps.  \nsdumitriu - (20:40): Javascript is great, just that it's badly used  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:41): Something I have been thinking would be nice is an api which is the same in Javascript on the client side as in velocity or groovy.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:41): So getDocument would be an ajax function.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:41): That idea.  \nsdumitriu - (20:44): Yes, that's a nice idea  \nsdumitriu - (20:45): And we're planning on doing a JS mirror API after we make a proper Java API  \nsdumitriu - (20:45): (model 2.0)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:45): +1  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:46): What I see as important is that we make things the same because subtle differences can be even more aggravating than major ones.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:47): How about manipulating the XDOM with script on the server side?  \nsdumitriu - (20:47): I think that's already possible  \nsdumitriu - (20:47): Since getXDOM returns a Java object  \nsdumitriu - (20:48): What's not possible is creating new stuff  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 20:48  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:48): Ahh, I thought it wasn't there yet when the script ran.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:48): If scripts run at rendering time then i suppose it is.  \nsdumitriu - (20:49): What I'd like is integrate Rhino, so that we can have serverside Javascript  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:49): +1  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:49): I am still not a huge fan of JS but I am a huge fan of making things the same if possible.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:50): I have thought of suggesting it myself.  \nsdumitriu - (20:50): JS could be a nice alternative to Velocity  \nsdumitriu - (20:50): It can be secure, yet it's a lot more familiar  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:50): Yes, Velocity is an analogue of bash which most people don't know.  \nsdumitriu - (20:51): Actually, it would be confusing, since most developers have a hard time making the difference between serverside and clientside scripting  \njvdrean left at 20:51 (Client Quit  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:52): Do you think it would be possible to make scripts which could run in either place?  \nsdumitriu - (20:52): So many users asked how can they get get a value from a HTML input from JS and pass it to a Velocity variable :D  \nsdumitriu - (20:52): Yes, but not all scripts  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:53): If it's possible then we could make an api to make it easier.  \nsdumitriu - (20:54): One major roadblock in having a JS clone of the API is the asynchronous aspect  \nsdumitriu - (20:54): You can't use getDocument() and have it returned instantly  \nsdumitriu - (20:54): You can, but it would block the browser  \nsdumitriu - (20:55): I still don't know what were people thinking when they made a whole process with all the JS in all pages  \nsdumitriu - (20:55): And even the UI (FF)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:55): I think you can block the script without blocking the browser with a prototype function.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:56): \"made a whole process with all the JS in all pages\" mmm meaning all js is one thread?  \nsdumitriu - (20:57): Yep  \nsdumitriu - (20:57): But this is changing  \nsdumitriu - (20:57): I don't know what browsers still do this  \nsdumitriu - (20:58): Chrome had different processes from the start  \nsdumitriu - (20:58): Firefox, IIRC, fixed this in 3.5 or 3.6  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:59): I think scheduleEvent will fork to a new thread.  \nsdumitriu - (20:59): link?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (20:59): It's not very authoritative :D  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:01): torcon 2006 guy said he could break firefox with js.  \nbbc581 joined #xwiki at 21:09  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:12): http://www.neilmix.com/2007/02/07/threading-in-javascript-17/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (21:13): Just turned that up with google.  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 21:36  \nnickless left at 21:47 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 21:51  \nnickless left at 22:06 (Quit: Leaving  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 22:23  \ncypromis left at 22:29 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \ncypromis joined #xwiki at 22:29  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 22:48  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:52): This is interesting http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:53): \"'Untrusted'  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:53): means that code in these prisons\u2014no matter what the code  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:53): does, no matter how badly it behaves, no matter how many  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:53): bugs it has\u2014cannot violate the user\u2019s security requirements.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (22:53): \"  \njfx left at 22:57 (Quit: WeeChat 0.3.0  \ngvallarelli joined #xwiki at 22:58  \ngvallarelli - (22:58): evening  \nsdumitriu - (22:58): Hi gvallarelli  \nsdumitriu - (22:58): So, what project are you targeting for GSoC?

 \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:22): The motherboard I like supports 2 75 watt opterons, 2 video cards, 64G of ram and 6 hard disks and I don't feel like upgrading the power supply.  \ngvallarelli - (23:23): :O  \ngvallarelli - (23:23): 64G ram? CalebJamesDeLisl are you planning to go to the moon? :D  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:24): And in the mb spec they say 550W minimum power. Also I think adding more power than I use will increase stability.  \nsdumitriu - (23:25): Mine is as 13W usually  \nsdumitriu - (23:25): s/as/at  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:26): The practical limitation on ram is that there are 8 slots and I don't like spending a lot of money on multi gb ram cards.  \ngvallarelli - (23:26): yeah I know you're a cheaper guy :D  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:27): Sure 13 watts at idle but what happens when you decide to put the video card to breaking RSA1024 or something...  \nsdumitriu - (23:28): Hehe, you don't put the video card to do that, you put The Cloud  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:28): BTW: how how are you able to determine your power consumption?  \nsdumitriu - (23:29): powertop  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:29): Something you plug the computer in to?  \nsdumitriu - (23:29): Well, it works when I'm on battery  \nsdumitriu - (23:29): Based on ACPI outputs, it measures the difference in capacity over time  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:30): \"The Cloud\" sdumitriu's private botnet? :D  \nsdumitriu - (23:30): It's nice when I suspend the laptop for a while, and it then says that my battery will last for a couple of years  \ngvallarelli - (23:30): eheh  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:31): The computer I have now has a 450W PS and it's a decent one which replaced a cheap one that blew up, and the computer was off at the time.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:33): Oversized power supplies have oversized capacitors which help absorb surges in grid power.  \ngvallarelli - (23:34): CalebJamesDeLisl, where do you work just for curiosity?  \nsdumitriu - (23:35): In the woods  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:36): I do some freelancing with xwiki.com but I can afford nice equiptment because #1 I have no car to eat my money, and #2 I buy a computer every 10 years.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:37): #3 I live at my dad's house.  \ngvallarelli - (23:37): how old are you?  \ngvallarelli - (23:37): :D  \nsdumitriu - (23:37): asl pls?  \ngvallarelli - (23:37): asl?  \nsdumitriu - (23:37): Ah, you're young  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:37): So I guess the correct answer is bum.  \ngvallarelli - (23:38): I'm 23  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (23:38): I'm like 22 maybe?
