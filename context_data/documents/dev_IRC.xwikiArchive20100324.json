For some reason XWiki isn't importing pages containing just groovy code. Seems that XWiki is skipping those pages. Is that to be expected?  \nsdumitriu - (13:52): No  \ntmortagne - (13:53): plunden1: what do you mean by \"pages containing just groovy code\" ? is it valid xml file representing a wiki page with groovy in the <content> part ?  \nDenis left #xwiki at 13:54  \nplunden1 - (13:57): tmortagne: Yes, the pages containing groovy code seem to be valid.  \ntmortagne - (13:57): do you have anything in the log ?  \ntmortagne - (13:58): how did you created this page ? is it a previous export ?  \nplunden1 - (13:59): Oh, seems that I found the bug.  \ntmortagne - (13:59): looks like group edition is broken in hudson tests  \ntmortagne - (13:59): (at least in hudson, i did not trying it yet)  \ntmortagne - (14:00): and it's doe snot seems to be a random failure  \nplunden1 - (14:00): tmortagne: We are extracting the .xml files from .xar to svn with a custom script.  \nplunden1 - (14:01): And vice versa, building the package.xml on the fly.  \ntmortagne - (14:02): plunden1: what bug did you found ?  \nplunden1 - (14:02): The bug is in our script, where it is creating package.xml.  \ntmortagne - (14:03): ok, btw there is a maven plugin to create xar packages  \ntmortagne - (14:03): see http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-tools/trunk/xwiki-xar-plugin/  \ntmortagne - (14:03): you can reuse it or see how package.xml is created  \nplunden1 - (14:07): tmortagne: Thanks for the tips.  \nsilviar - (14:07): jvdrean: Hi! Maybe you can use the color theme wizard and annotations documentation drafts for the release notes  \nsilviar - (14:07): http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/Annotations  \nsilviar - (14:07): http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/NewColorThemeWizard  \nvmassol - (14:08): CalebJamesDeLisl: I think we need to improve http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=Registration  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:08): What did you have in mind?  \nvmassol - (14:09): I can think of several things:  \nvmassol - (14:09): - Remove XWiki.RegistrationConfig name, it's too \u00a0technical  \nvmassol - (14:10): - have a single save (as it's done for other pages) or if several then we need to rethink the UI and maybe have a different admin page  \nvmassol - (14:10): - I'm not sure about the online help  \nvmassol - (14:10): (and it's not consistent with the rest which have no help)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:11): Which direction would you favor going in, toward more help or less?  \nvmassol - (14:11): I'm not sure  \nvmassol - (14:11): the pb is  \nvmassol - (14:11): to maintain it  \nvmassol - (14:11): is it maintained in one place?  \nvmassol - (14:11): (haven't checked)  \nvmassol - (14:12): is it translated in several languages?  \nvmassol - (14:13): in principle the idea of having more help in the default XE is good  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:13): It's in the svn repository, I just went to the bother of copying whats in the repo into the xwiki.org help page, but that should be just an include when the ApplicationSheet is syntax2.0  \nrstavro left at 14:14 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:14): It's not translated but I found myself reading the code to determine what some of the parameters meant and I didn't think that was right.  \nvmassol - (14:14): I think I'd prefer inline help as a general strategy too  \nvmassol - (14:14): (ie little question mark icons next to fields)  \nvmassol - (14:15): which pops up something  \nvmassol - (14:15): in any case we need to discuss this on the list  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:15): So a js popup.  \nvmassol - (14:15): to decide of a global strategy  \nvmassol - (14:15): and then start moving everything to it  \nvmassol - (14:15): the home page also has too much info IMO  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:16): In the mean time do you want me to pull the help out?  \nvmassol - (14:16): oh no  \nvmassol - (14:16): we need to decide what we want for the future first before doing anytihng  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:17): Ok. I should explain why there are multiple buttons and the big header.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:17): It's a technical limitation because one form cannot post to multiple documents.  \nvmassol - (14:17): I understand from a technical POV  \nvmassol - (14:17): I'm placing myself from a user POV here  \nvmassol - (14:17): as a user I don't even want to know about something called XWiki.RegistrationConfig if I don't have to  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:18): The header is there because other applications might want to add to that page and I thought it was helpful to seperate them.  \nvmassol - (14:18): what you've done looks very cool though  \nvmassol - (14:18): I think it \u00a0just needs some streamlining whatever this means  \nvmassol - (14:18): so UX person to go over it  \nrstavro joined #xwiki at 14:19  \njvdrean - (14:19): silviar: I can use some help with the release notes, feel free to edit them  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:20): I had intended to put a button at the bottom for saving everything, but it would be a Javascript hack.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:21): Again, I think removing the heading would cause the save button to be confusing and out of place.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:21): s/Again//  \nvmassol - (14:21): what you are saying I guess  \nvmassol - (14:21): is that the 2 notions on this page are different  \nvmassol - (14:22): and shouldn't be together  \nvmassol - (14:22): so maybe it's 2 different tabs in the same Registration config page?

Each object of that class would have a list field which pointed to objects which should have values loaded from the older version.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:34): So like extending Document.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:35): My thinking is why not keep the configuration close to the code which uses it, do it's not a special document as much as it is a special object attached to that document.  \nvmassol - (14:36): it's cleaner if it's a doc IMO  \nvmassol - (14:36): since it allows for ex to have a display sheet for it  \nvmassol - (14:36): so it's self-contained  \nvmassol - (14:36): but then I haven't really thought about it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:37): But then the code itself must know where to find it's configuration, and it must have defaults in case there is no configuration...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:38): It ends up looking a bit like the 'private static final String SOME\\_CLASS = \"XWiki.SomeClass\";' antipattern.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:38): What do you think of the api change I am proposing?  \nvmassol - (14:39): havne't looked yet  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:39): Document.saveAsAuthor()  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:39): set the author field to the author of the currently executing script and save if that author is permitted to edit.  \nflaviusolaru joined #xwiki at 14:42  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:46): Just sent another email about the API change, it would be nice to hear some discussion even if it is just \"-1\" it will at least stop me from dreaming.  \nDenis joined #xwiki at 15:10  \njvdrean - (15:16): catching up, vmassol about document types:  \njvdrean - (15:17): http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/OverhaulOfXWikiClassesAndObjectsManagement  \njvdrean - (15:17): http://markmail.org/message/walphzzl6dl2bqmi  \nvmassol - (15:17): ah was looking for \"document type\" in the description ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:21): Interesting page. I think that if we start rewriting the permissions manager, we are going to be dealing with many of these issues.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:23): I like the idea of the only permissions being read, write, execute and delete. (A clone of Unix permissions)  \nbblfish - (15:36): where do I edit the html that adds the picture on the wiki profile?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:38): Let me look, I think it's javascript.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:39): Nope, it's a template.  \nbblfish - (15:40): Which template is it? I'd like to make it rdfa  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:42): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/web/trunk/standard/src/main/webapp/templates/changemyavatar.vm  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:43): I would recommend creating a wiki page and redirecting the avitar button so that it can be all contained in the xar application.  \nbblfish - (15:43): yes. Let me first see how it works if I change that vm  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:44): You can just copy that code into a wiki page and it should run fine, you will have to specify what user it is for because $doc will point to the page.  \nbblfish - (15:44): currently I am have set http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/WebId/XWiki  \nsdumitriu - (15:44): nickless: FYI, JavaScript's decodeURIComponent fails to convert + to space  \nbblfish - (15:45): sorry http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/WebId/XWikiUserProfileSheet  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 15:45  \nbblfish - (15:45): should I copy that code into that wiki page?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:45): That sounds like a good idea, if you're running xwiki on your home computer you can edit the template and save and you do not have to restart the wiki engine.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:46): \"That sounds\" meaning editing the template to start.  \nbblfish - (15:46): well I am running it on webid.myxwiki.org  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:46): Ahh, your best off putting it in the wiki page then.  \nbblfish - (15:46): which wiki page?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:46): You just create a new one.  \nbblfish - (15:47): ok so WebId.Avatar  \nbblfish - (15:47): but there is something that calls that I suppose  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:47): That sounds good or maybe ChangeAvitar, it's up to you as far as I'm concerned.  \nbblfish - (15:48): yes, but just creating that page, won't propagate that change to all profiles I image  \nbblfish - (15:48): let me just do it  \nflorinciu\\_ joined #xwiki at 15:49  \nbblfish - (15:49): ok http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/WebId/ChangeMyAvatar  \nanamarias - (15:49): sdumitriu: If I'm binding a new event to Save&Continue button, and doing .stop() on it once I catch it, why is it still continuing calling this.onSaveAndContinue ?  \nanamarias - (15:50): What I did is:  \nanamarias - (15:50): document.observe('dom:loaded', function(event) {  \nanamarias - (15:50): \u00a0\u00a0$$('input[name=action\\_saveandcontinue]').each(function(item) {  \nanamarias - (15:50): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0item.observe('click', function(event) {  \nanamarias - (15:50): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0console.log('Caught click event on ' + event.element());  \nanamarias - (15:50): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0event.stop();  \nanamarias - (15:50): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}); }); });  \nanamarias - (15:51): I get the message logged in the Console, but the Save still happens  \nsdumitriu - (15:51): anamarias: Because you can't know the order that the listeners will be executed  \nanamarias - (15:51): so how can I prevent being called this.onSaveAndContinue ?  \nsdumitriu - (15:51): anamarias: Do an experiment, add a console.log also in the S&C behavior  \nsdumitriu - (15:51): Which one comes first?  \nanamarias - (15:51): I need to do some work first (an AJAX request and wait for it to finish)  \nanamarias - (15:52): and then continue normally with this.onSaveAndContinue  \nanamarias - (15:52): is there a way to do that? make sure my handler catches the event first?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:52): I have used Event.stopObserving to work around that issue.  \nbblfish - (15:53): CalebJamesDeLisl: I don't think that just having http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/WebId/ChangeMyAvatar is going to do anything  \nsdumitriu - (15:53): anamarias: No, the order is not known, the specification says that the order is not defined  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:53): bblfish: Correct, you will have to modify the code in UserSheet to point the link for change avatar to it.  \nsdumitriu - (15:53): So each browser does its own way  \nanamarias - (15:53): sdumitriu: can I do what CalebJamesDeLisl is suggesting? It's for the dashboard  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): Maybe  \nanamarias - (15:54): In inline edit mode, I need to first update the wiki content, and only after that, continue with the save&continue action  \nsdumitriu - (15:54): I can think of the following solutions:  \nanamarias - (15:54): (update to reflet the reordering of the gadgets on the dashboard)  \nsdumitriu - (15:55): 1. If it's generic enough, add your code in the standard file  \nsdumitriu - (15:55): 2. Unregister the default listener on that button and add your own  \nsdumitriu - (15:55): (what Caleb said)  \nanamarias - (15:56): regargin 1., I can't think how this could be used in a generic way  \nanamarias - (15:56): unrelated to the dashboard  \nsdumitriu - (15:56): 3. Same as 2, but unregister the listener on xwiki:actions:save  \nsdumitriu - (15:57): Is it about generating the right content from the order of the widgets?  \nanamarias - (15:57): sdumitriu: yes  \nsdumitriu - (15:58): You could also maintain this in real time  \nsdumitriu - (15:58): So instead of generating it before the save, keep it up to date whenever the layout changes  \nnickless left at 15:58 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nanamarias - (15:58): but I think the Save&Continue button at the end of the page is missleading  \nsdumitriu - (15:59): Why?  \nanamarias - (15:59): making the user think that unless the S&C is pressed, there d&d won't have any permanent effects  \nsdumitriu - (15:59): No, not to also save the layout  \nanamarias - (15:59): also there's the preview button  \nsdumitriu - (16:00): Just to generate it, and put it in the (hidden) content textarea  \nsdumitriu - (16:00): Then maybe it's a good idea to let the content decide which buttons to display  \nsdumitriu - (16:01): Like we do for the extra tabs (comments, attachments)  \nanamarias - (16:01): I don't how that's done  \nsdumitriu - (16:01): Now it's hardcoded: \"if the editor is object, then show these buttons\"  \nanamarias - (16:01): and how can the content affect which save / cancel buttons are displayed?  \nsdumitriu - (16:02): The content can set some variables  \nsdumitriu - (16:02): Like, if you have:  \nsdumitriu - (16:03): #set($showcomments = false)  \nsdumitriu - (16:03): somewhere in the content, then the comments tab won't be displayed  \nsdumitriu - (16:03): So, something similar  \nanamarias - (16:03): what should I show/hide in my case?  \nsdumitriu - (16:03): When generating the buttons, check if $showPreviewButton is defined and is false  \nanamarias - (16:04): hmm  \nanamarias - (16:04): but  \nanamarias - (16:04): as my dashboard is a macro  \nanamarias - (16:04): all the containing page will be in inline edit more  \nsdumitriu - (16:04): Yes  \nanamarias - (16:04): soma maybe some of the other content on the page really need all the buttons  \nsdumitriu - (16:05): You can define this variable anywhere  \nanamarias - (16:05): what did you mean with the (hidden) content textarea?  \nsdumitriu - (16:05): So define it near the code that displays the editable dashboard  \nanamarias - (16:05): where is that?  \nsdumitriu - (16:05): That's the code that you write  \nanamarias - (16:06): I looked at an page in inline mode, and there's no hidden textarea element in it  \nsdumitriu - (16:09): No, you should put it  \nanamarias - (16:09): and why would I need it ?  \nanamarias - (16:09): what will I do with its content in the end?  \nsdumitriu - (16:10): The Dashboard code should be something like:  \nsdumitriu - (16:10): #if($context.action == 'inline')  \nsdumitriu - (16:10): \u00a0\u00a0Here's the code that is executed only in inline mode  \nsdumitriu - (16:10): \u00a0\u00a0<textarea class=\"hidden\" name=\"content\">$escapetool.xml($tdoc.content)</textarea>  \nsdumitriu - (16:10): \u00a0\u00a0#set($hidePreviewButton = true)  \nsdumitriu - (16:10): #end  \nsdumitriu - (16:11): How do you plan to save the updated content?  \nanamarias - (16:12): i was thinking to make a request to a page getting the content and modifying it  \nanamarias - (16:12): just before the normal save is done  \nsdumitriu - (16:12): You don't need an extra request, putting it inside a textarea with name=\"content\" is enough  \nsdumitriu - (16:13): And the usual save will work  \nanamarias - (16:13): yup, it looks this way  \nanamarias - (16:13): then how do I tell the normal save action to use the content in my textarea ?  \nanamarias - (16:13): when saving the doc?  \nanamarias - (16:14): only for the dashboard  \nanamarias - (16:14): because if there are any other editable fields, their modifications won't be taken into consideration  \nanamarias - (16:14): will they?  \nanamarias - (16:15): so saving the content in the textarea will prevent other modifications to the page from being saved  \nsdumitriu - (16:16): Why?  \nsdumitriu - (16:16): All the data sent to the server is saved, if it belongs to the current document  \nanamarias - (16:16): first, how do I use the content in the textarea?  \nbblfish - (16:16): CalebJamesDeLisl: I just had to slightly change http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/WebId/XWikiUserSheet  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:17): Cool, you'll also have to change all instances of $doc in your new document.  \nbblfish - (16:18): you mean in the above document?

It's cool lots of people like it  \nbblfish - (16:45): I think it's more a qustion fo createing certificates with http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Natanael\\_L?xpage=plain\u00a0  \nbblfish - (16:45): webids  \nbblfish - (16:45): But I noticed there is an inconsistency between the rdf in those different representations  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:46): xpage=plain is long and non specific, I think we should go with ?me then we can do what xpage=plain is doing already but do it later.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:46): \"non specific\" it is an XWiki term, it might change, we should standardize ?me IMO  \nbblfish - (16:47): I think we should have it be  \nbblfish - (16:47): http://webid.myxwiki.org/id/http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Natanael\\_L?xpage=plain  \nbblfish - (16:47): that should be the short view  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:48): Your parser doesn't choke on xpage=plain?  \nbblfish - (16:48): no.

Just simple views.  \nsdumitriu - (16:50): bblfish: There's a plan for internal redirects  \nsdumitriu - (16:50): Not redirects, URL rewrites  \nbblfish - (16:51): when you have that done we can put it on webid.my...  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:52): How about if the requester sends a specific http header which signals the code to only return the rdf stuff?  \nbblfish - (16:52): that's called content negotiaation  \nanamarias left at 16:54 (Quit: anamarias  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:57): Question: What happens if the server has a URI in it's key just like the client key?  \nbblfish - (16:57): I don't understand.
