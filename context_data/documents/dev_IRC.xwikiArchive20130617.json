It packages the wysiwyg jars but not the war, i.e. not the js/css resources. The question is where should I fix this, in the packager or in my pom? I fixed it in the pacakger so far, but maybe the reason the editor war wasn't pacakged is because you though it wasn't needed in general  \n09:45\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n09:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0fixing the problem in my pom has 2 issues: (1) I need to add dependency on platform-web and root-webapp, and more importantly, (2) the packager unpacks a war in a folder with the same name, expect for platform-web and root-webapp which are handled separtely.  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0So if I add a dep to wysiwyg war in my pom I get xwiki-platform-wysiwyg-war folder on the same level with \"webaps/xwiki\" and \"webapps/root\"  \n09:47\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's why I decided to fix the problem in the packager plugin  \n09:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0i.e. add dep to wysiwyg war (instead of the jars, because the war brings the jars) and unpack it in \"xwiki\" folder  \n09:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so basically the question is: should the \"xwiki\" generated by the packager plugin have a working WYSIWYG editor? If not, then it would be great if the packager plugin offered a simple way to merge a war dep in \"xwiki\" folder (i.e. merge with platform web war)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back, reading mflorea  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: IMO our general direction should be to remove more and more from the packager plugin so that all deps are added by projects. This will happen as we resolve our missing dependencies between existing modules. Packaging the wysiwyg editor for ex should be optional indeed and come as a dependecy ideally  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know what's practical rigth now on this topic though  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ATM we have quite a lot of stuff hardcoded in the packager plugin which isn't that nice  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we keep adding them. At some point we need to clean that up and remove what we can remove  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so  \n09:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I agree, but it's complicated to merge a war in the \"xwiki\" folder with what the packaer plugin offers right now..  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in your case maybe the only possible solution ATM is to have it in the packager plugin (I don't know really about that) but we need to keep in mind that this means we'll need to remove it in the future and work on our deps  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure, maybe the packager plugin also needs to offer some additional generic features  \n10:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: ok, thanks  \n10:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:12\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has quit  \n10:13\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:14\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0For normal users is there a way to hide spaces like Macros ?  \n10:14\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0Administration for Macros shows no one has permissions to view  \n10:23\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has quit  \n10:24\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:25\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has quit  \n10:26\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<jrgill>\u00a0has quit  \n10:34\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:35\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:41\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: Are the instructions for the Workspace application listed here (http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Workspace+Application) still right?  \n10:42\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0it seems like xwiki runs in virtual mode all the time now  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0altker128: yes since 5.0, we need to update all docs  \n10:44\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0WorkspaceManager is complaining that the template wasn't there, so I downloaded the 5.02 template, rename and velocity is giving errors  \n10:44\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/2FpULMja  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0altker128: please report any issue you have in jira.
