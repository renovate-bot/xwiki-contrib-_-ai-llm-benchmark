I used the same browser FF 3.6.17. There is something different on CI.

 \n10:42\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I want to see a test run without hundreds of failures first  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have the feeling that this is a real issue: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/755/testReport/ but it's on trunk not 3.1  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm not good: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests-3.1/lastBuild/testReport/  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm could be a real pb  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since sergiu merged his changes on 3.1 FAIR  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIR  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm talking about his changes for migrating propertie, he could have broken something  \n10:44\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Lets run them on an agent that is well known to be correct then pass judgement.  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure\u2026 agent3 seems ok by looking at the other tests though  \n10:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:48\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0re storage tests, I think the best thing to do is backup the database directory and wipe and replace after each run.  \n10:48\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0or perhaps I can find a way to change configuration so it uses a different db directory, then I can run them concurrently  \n10:57\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n11:02\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: could http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/756/testReport/junit/org.xwiki.test.ui/EditObjectsTest/testChangeMultiselectProperty/ be caused by your correction ?

Anyone who needs X code to run on every startup can just drop it in the config file.  \n14:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0For groovy, we'd have to write our own maven plugin to do that  \n14:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, maybe we're talking of different things  \n14:26\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0no, pom.xml being in groovy would also be cool but that's cool for us, xwiki.properties is cool for the users.  \n14:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0A problem I see we are facing is we have too many config files. we have hibernate, logging, xwiki.cfg, xwiki.properties  \n14:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0xwiki.cfg is slowly merged into xwiki.properties  \n14:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So it's a deprecated old file  \n14:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0This stands in the way of the goal of not making users unzip the .war file.  \n14:30\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yea and oldcore is slowly being removed but the word slowly is practicly in geoloical terms.  \n14:31\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n14:31\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://logback.qos.ch/manual/groovy.html  \n14:34\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0logback gave me the idea  \n14:34\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0actually no, I was doing that in my attempt at smarter ci mail  \n14:41\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0sdumitriu: Are you fixing XWIKI-6697 for the release today?
