Is it normal that I cannot resize an image in chrome when in the wysiwyg editor?  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0answer: no it's not normal\u2026. It works in FF  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll create a jira  \n12:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I haven't checked, could be a limitation of Chrome, i.e. it might not support image resize by default, like FF does.  \n12:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't remember preventing image resize or something like that in the WYSIWYG code  \n12:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: can you resize the image from this demo http://ckeditor.com/demo in Chrome?  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they have the same problem here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/resize-images-in-chrome  \n12:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so yes, it's most probably a Chrome limitation. You can still open the issue, maybe there are workarounds.  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://cutesoft.net/forums/thread/66261.aspx  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so yes  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems to be a limitation  \n12:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0might be good to indicate it somewhere on xwiki.org as a known limitation on chrome  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you know if chrome has an issue tracker?  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's probably a webkit issue though  \n12:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, some were saying it's the same in Safary  \n12:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Safari  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Per the TinyMCE development staff, it is a resource that is not built into WebKit (which is the core for Safari and a significant part of Chrome). As of March 2010 this was their statement (\"The WebKit browser doesn't support live image resizing or even image selection. We are faking that right now, we reported this issue a few years ago to Apple and still no progress\", http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=71775) and it s  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0source: http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=3b21becc3e4f6b04&hl=en  \n12:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it's an old issue  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here's the issue on the webkit tracker: https://bugs.webkit.org/show\\_bug.cgi?id=7154  \n12:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: implementing Comparable for EntityReference parameter also cause a similar issue to clone, since I cannot ensure objects in the map are comparable  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:06\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0has quit  \n13:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:34\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:35\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n13:48\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:51\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:11\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0is now known as <npm>  \n16:54\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I've changed the from to prevent the spam  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0fyi the xwiki mail server will be migrated in the coming few days to a new machines and it'll use some newer antispam  \n17:19\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0nice  \n17:19\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0setting the from and to to the same address is a common tactic  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0want some fun: try this: http://82.233.128.14:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/My+First+Presentation  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(and click on \"Run this presentation\")  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I was told it's taking time to load from remote (it's very fast locally)  \n17:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Trying it with noscript  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0should be fun...  \n17:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Doesn't look as nice, but it's usable  \n18:23\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol1: OK for closing http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-3935 ?  \n18:52\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0ok although we'll need to figure out something in the longer run  \n18:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In which direction?  \n18:53\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0no idea\u2026. :)  \n19:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0I think that the precedence level of rights should be made more intutive. \u00a0I made a suggestion about that some time ago: http://xwiki.markmail.org/message/tmqwvi5owierpgx2?q=right+priority+Andreas+Jonsson  \n19:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: OK for group priorities  \n19:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But how should those be defined?  \n19:29\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:38\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n19:51\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0sdumitriu: A simple scheme is to just say that XWikiAllGroup has low priority and all other groups have the same high priority.  \n19:52\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0But the priority can also be exposed as a configurable parameter.  \n19:55\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:44\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:54\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:11\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
