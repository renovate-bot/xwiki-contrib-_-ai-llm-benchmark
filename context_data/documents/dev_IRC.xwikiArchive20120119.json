I see it fail to find default LoggerManager but this component is in XE for sure  \n12:29\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0if it is really, it would have found it  \n12:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: it is for sure  \n12:29\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0it is related to the packager  \n12:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's used by EM  \n12:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0and the issue in platform as well  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha so it's actually missing in the packager that's all  \n12:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0maybe  \n12:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I am not really aware about that tool  \n12:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0either you make your code support the possibility that there is no LoggerManager or we just add it as dependency where it's missing  \n12:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0packager kind of mock a xwiki to create the hsqldb database  \n12:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it's starting hibernate store  \n12:32\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I think the logger manager should be available where the logger is  \n12:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it'sz no  \n12:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not the same thing  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can need to log without advanced stuff  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and most of all logger-api should never trigger logback  \n12:33\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0true  \n12:34\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but logback or another back-end is needed to log  \n12:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes or another backend  \n12:34\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so the logger manager should provide the backend  \n12:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it's not API job to decide which backend  \n12:35\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0it is not the api which is missing$  \n12:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I know  \n12:35\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but the implementation in relation with the backend  \n12:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and I'm telling you there is no reason you have the backedn when you just have the API as dependency  \n12:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so we just need to put the proper dependencies like we do in XE  \n12:36\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure, but it would be silly for the store to think about the absence of a manager and the presence of a backend at the same time  \n12:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: I said it was one one technical possibility I never said the store should do that  \n12:37\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0It would have been better to not have direct dependency on logback, but on the logger manager  \n12:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is no way to do what we need just with log4j API  \n12:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I would have loved it too...  \n12:38\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure, but you may have a logger manager implementation anyway, that do something good  \n12:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/log4j/slf4j  \n12:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's what we have...  \n12:39\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so the logback implementation of the logger manager should provide logback, and we should not depend on logback IMO. If we want another logger, we need an implementation of the logger manager for it  \n12:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyway you are supposed to select the proper implementation of the logging api in your app  \n12:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it doesnot make sense for a final app \u00a0to get only the API  \n12:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's the same for many things  \n12:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: I don't understand what you mean  \n12:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we need logback  \n12:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0how the logger manager could not depends onlogback  \n12:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0logback  \n12:40\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0If you want to use log4j for exemple, you cannot without a logger manager for it  \n12:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n12:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it just need to be done  \n12:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we don't have the need ourself  \n12:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it's not done yet  \n12:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but it's not much to do  \n12:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0also log4j doe snot implements slf4j  \n12:41\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so what I said, is that your app should not depend on logback, but on the logger manager that use logback  \n12:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0which is our standard API  \n12:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so that would not make much sense to have a log4j based impl  \n12:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: yes and taht's exactly what we do in XE  \n12:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I never said you were supposed to trigger directly logback  \n12:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you are supposed to take the proper logging impl  \n12:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the packager is wrong that's all  \n12:42\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0we should do so everywhere so  \n12:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0everywhere is not much places actually  \n12:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0XE, packager, test framework maybe not much more  \n12:44\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0currently I have just added a test deps on old-core has you suggested  \n12:45\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but I was feeling it was not good since there is no reason to have it there in particular  \n12:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I suggested to make sure the logger impl was a test dep, not that it had to be on oldcore, it could be on generic test frameworkk  \n12:45\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0it should have been  \n12:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we tend to forget to do things that are not required on the moment ;)  \n12:46\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I have not introduce the logger manager, just use it, I am not comfortable with the whole stuff  \n12:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: where did I said it was your fault ?  \n12:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0no where, but this is my commit which currently broke the build, and I am feeling guiltu  \n12:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0:)  \n12:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no need  \n12:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0fixing packager and test fmk  \n12:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0cool  \n12:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0thanks tmortagne  \n12:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0remove the deps in old core  \n12:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm depending on logging impl in test fmk make it a bit harder to test the logging impl, will have to do some hack  \n12:51\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but it is better to have it in one place  \n12:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n12:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe we need another test module  \n12:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lets start with the packager to fix the build  \n12:53\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0ok, would you like I file an issue in jira ?
