We're planing to stat working on this at the beginning on the next year (2016)  \n13:49\u00a0<cthiel>\u00a0mflorea: cool! so it's a good idea to start testing / using the xwiki-contrib ext?  \n13:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, we'll stat the integration from this extension  \n13:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0s/stat/start  \n13:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0i.e. we're going to build on top of the current extension  \n14:47\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n15:04\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:05\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Hi devs  \n15:06\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I'm trying to access User profiles from a Java code and I usually think like I would do in Velocity (services.query then Xwiki.getDocument().getObject)  \n15:06\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Is there a better way to do that?  \n15:07\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0woshilapin: you should use QueryManager component instead of services.query but appart from this that's pretty much it, there is no user oriented API  \n15:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, thanks :-)  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:05\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:07\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0hi! I am using xwiki 7.2, everything works perfecly, but i got one wuestion: If i share a site via E-Mail the url in that email is set to http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ but it should be http://mydomain.de/xwiki/bin/view/Main How can i change this?  \n16:08\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Is it actually using port 8080 in the email while listening on port 80?  \n16:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there is likely some proxy information missing. the frontend server should pass the infomation that XWiki is proxied, and then it should be fine  \n16:18\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0ahhh found it, i had to set xwiki.home= in xwiki.cfg  \n16:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok :)  \n16:19\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0it runs on localhost, but gets proxy\\_passed, so that parameter has to exist  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0flashdel: xwiki.home property is kind of a last resort property, in standard as ClemensR explain XWiki is supposed to deduce it from the URL requesting it but that imply the proxy is properly configured to let all information pass trough  \n16:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0what might confuse it is that the very first request comes from http://localhost:8080 ... i.e. internal cron job, and the e-mail sending job remembers this, due to lack of other information  \n16:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if that is the case, you might have to hardwire the \"proper\" value in xwiki.home=... just to make sure  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes cron stuff is the usual use case that might cause force to use this property  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but only if the crong request is the very first request  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/crong/cron/  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but that's mostly for main wiki, for other wikis what is used most of the time is the wiki descriptor  \n16:38\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0tmortagne: i am just using one wiki, so i guess its no problem if i configure it that way?  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0flashdel: it's not that much of a probleme but it usually means your the proxy in front of XWiki is not properly configured since that property is supposed to be useless  \n16:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe some extension or other feature not related to URL generation need to get the right request URL  \n16:44\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0tmortagne: ok i will keep that in mind, thanks!  \n17:08\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<iamchrisf>\u00a0has quit  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/90e2bed48f51a073f761bf557cd6dd7fb8f38bd9#commitcomment-14188335  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should I remove it ?
