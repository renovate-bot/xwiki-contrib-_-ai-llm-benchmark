Which version of XWiki are you using btw ?  \nMenso - (15:21): My current dev environment is running 2.5.32127  \nMenso - (15:21): I pasted the code here: http://pastebin.com/CMYSHhHu  \nMenso - (15:22): Basically this loops through a form and assigns the autosuggest to specific elements based on their name, but they all seem to get assigned the same suggest instead of one of the two options  \njvelo left at 15:25 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 15:27  \nlucaa left at 15:55 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmandrilly joined #xwiki at 16:19  \nvmandrilly - (16:20): Hello!  \nmflorea - (16:21): vmassol: I have one test failing in xwiki-rendering-tests with the latest sources, can you reproduce?  \nmflorea - (16:21): Failed tests:  \nmflorea - (16:21): \u00a0\u00a0simple/encoding/encoding1.test [xhtml/1.0, xhtml/1.0](org.xwiki.rendering.scaffolding.RenderingTestCase)  \nvmandrilly - (16:31): Here is where I am with tmy project : 1- xwiki installed and running on the computer. 2- xwiki now online. 3- I did a short description of the project. Next step should have been to detail the different things to do, then describe how everything should work, with pictures, but I have been too curious and started to learn velocity. The information on the apache website is very small, but now I can do a set to give a variable a value, make additions, use   \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:31  \nvmandrilly - (16:34): And don't ask me if I am a begginner, the anwear is yes :P  \nlucaa left at 16:37 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:37  \nlucaa left at 16:39 (Client Quit  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:39  \nlucaa left at 16:40 (Client Quit  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:40  \nlucaa left at 16:41 (Client Quit  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:41  \nlucaa1 joined #xwiki at 16:43  \nlucaa left at 16:43 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nvmandrilly - (16:47): Btw, the project is called \"wikiacy\" for now, www.wikiacy.com  \nlucaa1 left at 16:51 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:51  \nlucaa left at 16:55 (Client Quit  \nlucaa1 joined #xwiki at 16:57  \nvmandrilly - (16:58): lucca: got connection problems?  \nlucaa2 joined #xwiki at 17:04  \nlucaa1 left at 17:04 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nlucaa2 left at 17:07 (Client Quit  \nvmandrilly - (17:07): hello, my room is full of lucca enter and leaves the room, how can I stop these messages?  \ncjdelisle` - (17:43): vmandrilly, not sure, have to look at documentation for your irc client.  \ncjdelisle` - (17:44): something about not displaying quit/join messages I assume.  \ncjdelisle` - (17:44): I just ignore all the quit/join spam. It's usually caused by bad internet connections.  \njvelo - (17:46): mflorea, I reproduce the rendering test failure  \nmflorea - (17:47): jvelo: thanks  \nDenis left at 18:07 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmandrilly - (18:32): cjdelisle: thanks. I did learn the velocity as you recommanded. How to get input from the user, read from and write to database ? Any doc somewhere ?  \ncjdelisle` - (18:33): If you have a <form> <input name=\"inputName\" /> and you submit that form, what was typed into the input field will be available to velocity as $request.getParameter(\"inputName\")  \nvmandrilly - (18:34): ok  \nvmandrilly - (18:36): Any doc for all these xwiki commands like $request.getParameter ? So that I can find the infos about database and others  \nvmandrilly - (18:36): ?  \ncjdelisle` - (18:37): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting start here, follow the links.  \nvmandrilly - (18:37): thanks  \nvmandrilly - (18:38): Should I learn Java first ?  \nvmandrilly - (19:02): ok I think I should better go for pithon or ruby since it is availlable and seem more simple.  \nvmassol left at 19:13 (Quit: Leaving.  \nEnygma` left at 20:20 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nMenso - (20:29): Can I update or add stuff to xwiki.org documentation?  \njvelo - (20:33): Menso, yes you can  \njvelo - (20:33): it's a wiki :)  \nMenso - (20:39): That's what I figured, but I can't find a register link :-) http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/login/XWiki/XWikiLogin?xredirect=http%3A%2F%2Fplatform.xwiki.org%2Fxwiki%2Fbin%2Fview%2FMain%2F  \njvelo - (21:28): Menso, you might be interested by autoSuggest behavioral CSS classes  \njvelo - (21:29): check http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/web/trunk/standard/src/main/webapp/resources/js/xwiki/xwiki.js and search for \"Suggest\"  \njvelo - (21:30): if you implement it for your use case, it would mean you would just have to add a \"suggestSupplier\" or \"suggestProduct\" CSS class to your input, and it would suggest the proper type of item  \njvelo - (21:36): BTW there is a problem with your example : you seem to use the same ID for several form elements. This is not correct, you should rather use class names (ID are supposed to be unique in the DOM)  \nvmandrilly left #xwiki at 21:38  \nmflorea left at 21:40 (Quit: Leaving.  \nMenso - (22:03): jvelo: the thing is I'd like to modify the code base itself as little as possible, so rewriting xwiki.js files I'd rather avoid  \njvelo - (22:04): Menso, that's not what I meant. You don't have to modify xwiki.js, just look at the example I've pointed out to write your own code  \nMenso - (22:04): I adjusted the sample code a little, what it does for me is loop through form elements and if they end in \\_Supplier or \\_SoftProd they get assigned their appropriate autosuggest  \nMenso - (22:05): I'm not sure I see what you mean in the url you provided  \njvelo - (22:05): let me make you a snippet  \njvelo - (22:13): Menso, check http://tinypaste.com/17547  \njvelo - (22:13): (not tested though :)  \njvelo - (22:14): If you have some time to make it work and update the page on xwiki.org, that would be great! (this one is cleaner and closer to our dev. practices)  \nMenso - (22:15): how do I add classes to my class properties?  \njvelo - (22:16): ah you use XClasses and doc.display ?  \nMenso - (22:16): yus  \njvelo - (22:16): there is no easy yet I think  \njvelo - (22:16): one sec  \nMenso - (22:16): That's why I did it the way I did  \njvelo - (22:18): but how can it work with ID your example ?  \njvelo - (22:18): myForm[i].id =='Supplier'  \njvelo - (22:18): you can't have such an id generated by doc.display  \njvelo - (22:18): there is something you could do though  \nMenso - (22:18): right, so my code actually does this  \njvelo - (22:18): supplier and product are properties, right ?  \nMenso - (22:19): if(Right(myForm[i].id, 8)=='Supplier'){  \njvelo - (22:19): I see  \nMenso - (22:19): and the element is called blahclassbs\\_Supplier  \njvelo - (22:19): you can do different  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 22:20  \njvelo - (22:21): coming back with a new snippet  \njvelo - (22:21): :)  \njvelo - (22:23): Menso, http://tinypaste.com/819ee9  \njvelo - (22:24): again, not tested. Maybe you don't need the quotes around 'name', I don't recall  \njvelo - (22:27): Menso, actually there is a mistake, it's ~= not =~  \njvelo - (22:28): but even better, it should use $=  \njvelo - (22:28): \"input[name$='\\_Supplier']\"  \nMenso - (22:28): does .endswith actually exist?  \njvelo - (22:28): it's a prototype method, yes  \njvelo - (22:29): prototype.js I mean  \nMenso - (22:29): hah, excellent, I should use that then :-)  \njvelo - (22:29): for \u00a0\"input[name$=\\_Supplier]\" check http://www.prototypejs.org/api/utility/dollar-dollar  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 22:33  \njvelo - (22:34): sdumitriu, Hi.
