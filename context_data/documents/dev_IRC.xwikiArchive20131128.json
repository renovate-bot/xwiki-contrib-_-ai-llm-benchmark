 \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it contains tons of package.xml files  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I export a single page  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using the menu  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and there are lots of exceptions in the console  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand, it contains several entries with the same path ?  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just try to reproduce it it's easy  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm problem is that even if I turn the new wikistream of it still fails  \n13:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki.action.import.xar.usewikistream=0  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to export some pages\u2026. hmmm that's starting to be a pain, I guess I need to download some older version and configure it to use my db  \n13:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki.action.import.xar.usewikistream is for import as you can see in the name  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah indeed you added some config  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n13:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it's disabled by default as indicated in the comment  \n13:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it used to be hte last one  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool works  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with hte old export)  \n13:59\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0how can i easily iterate through all document revisions? the easiest way i can see right now is getting or.suigeneris.jrcs.rcs.Version array from getRevisions() method, then somehow concat array it returns from method getNumbers() to get revision number and then calling doc.getDocumentRevision(), but it seems to stupid to be the only way  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: you could check the code for the history tab at the bottom  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$document.getRevisions()  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0will give you all the versions  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0returns an array of Version[]  \n14:02\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yes, but Version is 3rd party code that doesnt have any method, that returns string (only tostring with stringbuffer param)  \n14:02\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0where can i see History tab code?  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a tostring  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think  \n14:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep, just tried it, thanks  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: here:  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$stringtool.join($doc.revisions, ',')  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: fixed, I'm surprised no integration test failed, there is at least one that does XAR export  \n14:05\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0vmassol: yep, thanks  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to reimport the core language properties on l10n  \n14:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0do we have a special mailing list for l10n?

 \n17:38\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, no subwikis in the test instance ... one moment ...  \n17:41\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0hm, neither workspaces now wiki manager in the wiki, even though extension manager says it is installed ...  \n17:46\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, me stupid, forgot to install the template wiki ;)  \n17:47\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0the XWiki.XWikiServerWorkspacetemplate still has the (no longer exisiting) WikiManager.WebHome as parent, btw  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0camil7: you'll like 5.3 :)  \n17:48\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, yes, sorry, should not bother about that but the search thing  \n17:51\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0I got autocompletion results in search, in a freshly created subwiki and a plain vanilla 5.2.1  \n17:53\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0unlike e.g. extensions.xwiki.org, the ajax calls are properly triggered  \n17:55\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0of course I get no javascript errors in either case, that would be far too easy :-/  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n18:08\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0there is no XWiki.SuggestSolrService on extensions.xwiki.org , maybe that has been renamed, but not migrated ?  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0stupid me  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have not installed the search app on subwikis of xwiki.org  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we wanted the search box to redirect to the main wiki  \n18:10\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0that maybe does not make sense for the \"hosted wiki\" scenario, where local users in subwikis do not even see the main wiki?  \n18:11\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, no, now I get it, in that case the url is just wrong, as it always looks for a \"local\" suggestion service  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdym by wrong url?  \n18:12\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0well, url to the local wiki SearchSuggest, when the is none at all, and it should query the main wiki instead  \n18:13\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0(if that is possible at all and not cause cross domain problems)  \n18:13\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0uh, and if in doubt, do not get confused by my chattering ;)  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do'nt have this feature ATM  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we set up on xwiki.org is a hack  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have custom Main.Search pages  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0redirect to the main wiki  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*redirecting  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but our solution doesn't work for suggest  \n18:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: yes, search app si not installed on subwiki (sorry, I was in a meeting)  \n18:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we have a that local/global/both information in standard in 5.3 so we should probably make the search and search suggest take in into account  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: lucaa says there's still a migration problem which could explain what our user got  \n18:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the only migration issue I talked with lucaa is the fact that you could end up with solr as configured engine even if you had lucene before.  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: cheeck on skype  \n18:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0mflorea: that's about the same one  \n18:35\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0can someone merge https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/pull/53 and https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/228 ?
