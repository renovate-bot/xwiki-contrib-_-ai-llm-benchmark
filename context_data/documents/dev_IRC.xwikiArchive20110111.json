As I said I only tried to make them all the same.  \n10:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But I think we need a page which gives fair warning to potential users that xwiki does not (as a policy) prevent editors from inserting javascript into pages.  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: well that would hte securitu page I guess  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have such a page  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me dig it for oyu  \n10:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I wrote it ;)  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Security  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why not put security stuff in there?  \n10:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But yes, there is a page about improving security but what I'm looking for is a specification.  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why not put the spec in there?  \n10:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The user is allowed to do 1, 2, 3, 4...  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(security spec that is)  \n10:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it will grow to a rather large page and it has to be voted on because it is policy.  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: you want to handle this? You could start sending some specific mails on specific issues and when we get an agremeent you doc it there?  \n10:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I can start something in /Drafts/ and make it look like what I \\_think\\_ the specification is then get validation from the committers, how does that sound?  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0heh I have the most wonderful proposal waiting for the list to start up again :)  \n10:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0TransactionRunnable.

If I have a page with attachments and I esport it as XAR, I look in the XAR file and there is only one XML file. I import it back in another wiki and I have there the attachments too. I am talking about images. How is that possible ?  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the image is in the xml  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0base64 encoded  \n11:39\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think a better question would be, is this going to change when the new attachment store will be introduced?  \n11:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well ... at least for \"transporting\" a page with attachments, this mechanism is pretty cool.. to have all in one file. Except maybe when there are HUGE attachments, and you'd get a 300 mb file  \n11:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n11:42\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm i think cjdelisle mentioned there is a hard limit to the maximum size of attachments right now  \n11:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: another quick question : I have installed locally Se 2b1, and it does its job very well ... regarding XE-799, the patch for this would be only to modify the pom.xml to the according version, right ?  \n11:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0the pom.xml of ui-tests  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: yes  \n11:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: in this case, I'll upload the patch now :)  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you've tested it and there are no more tests failing than before?  \n11:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well ... a lot of tests fail due to XE 3.0 bugs. But I think I'll wait until we fix those bugs, and see how many tests fail after that. WDYT ?  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just run it  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and see if more or less tests fail  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if less then it's good ;)  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if equal then it's also good  \n11:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0the tests that fail locally fail also on hudson.. whish isnt using Se2b1  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if more then you need to dig more deeply and understand what has changed  \n11:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0there are limits on the size of an attachment, the number of attachments, and the number of revisions of an attachment.  \n11:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The limit on the number of attachments (on one document) will only cause failure to export the document.  \n11:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Hmm. Actually it may not. There may be no limit on the number of attachments since my last change to attachments.  \n11:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0In the future, I think it would be nice to have an export system which places attchments seperate from their document in the zip file (or better the lzma file)  \n11:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: another question.

Very odd. I usually remember my logic :) If I don't get it, I will modify test according to my new logic :)  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0look at rev 30635  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: btw you should try to never use getDriver() in a test  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since most of the time it means there's a page object api missing  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you should instead introduce one and use it  \n11:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay. i will keep that in mind  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that makes tests more maintainable or easier to read  \n11:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0you also mentioned something about tear down, but I didn't understood  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm#tests\\_2  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixtures are supposed to be written in @Before @After methods  \n12:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, I know  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and usually a best practice is to group tests that share the same fixture  \n12:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but there are a lot of tests that don't need fixture  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0group them in the same test that is  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0test class  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also  \n12:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, so I'll update UserProfileTest accordingly  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my best practice is to always have tests set up what they require before the test rather than restoring an initial state  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that they don't depend on other tests as much as possible  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only excpetion is when setting up stuff is too expensice in term of time  \n12:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well restoring would mean to \"leave things as you found them\", in order to don't mess with other tests  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this case you can have a workflow, ie an order in which the tests are executed  \n12:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0understand your POV  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which btw is why it's acceptable in functional tests to do several things in the same test method  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which isn't acceptable in unit tests)  \n12:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but there are certain cases when this strategy doesn't work. Example : UserProfileTest .. I change users info, and then restore them.  \n12:03\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it works if you create a new user for ex instead of restoring user info  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it may take too much time, I don't know, this is case by case basis  \n12:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes.. this is what I was going to write  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's improtant is to have the smallest possible test that works  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and tests that run as fast as possible  \n12:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Being right all of the time is indeed a most terrible burdon for you must write all of your code knowing there is a it will never have to be fixed.  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0smallest is for readiblity/maintanibility  \n12:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay then, so until failing tests due to XE 3.0 bugs won't work, I will not upload SE2b1 patch  \n12:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Then you get a typical C programmer.  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: so the rule is simple. 1) make the tests as small as possible and 2) ensure it runs fast (and allow yourself a small increase in test size provided that gets you an important perf gain)  \n12:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I suppose we don't allow objects to cause groovy code to run.  \n12:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: understood. I almost ported all methods from UserProfileTest (selenium-test) to ui-tests  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0small as possible is cool because it forces you group together tests with the same fixture and makes the test more readable ad more maintanble  \n12:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes ...  \n12:10\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0OTOH do we allow script in an object to run if it's being edited in inline mode and in WYSIWYG editor?  \n12:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm going to say: Yes, but only if the containing document calls that object from it's class sheet.  \n12:20\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: you were saying we shouldn't have try catch in test methods ?  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: yes as much as possible  \n12:21\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay. we have on test from selenium-tests that has (in UserProfileTest) ..

If it happens to be a textArea then it can contain script.  \n13:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But saving an object changes the contentAuthor so no PR bug.  \n13:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0And the first property of a comment is not a textArea so it is not interpreted.  \n13:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Perhaps the object editor should start using dropPermissions since running script in the object editor is indeed an edge use case.  \n14:00\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0hey guys  \n14:00\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0any idea about how I could detect that I am in a 3.0+ version of XWiki from scripting, without using PR ?  \n14:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0$xwiki.getVersion() ?  \n14:01\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yeah...  \n14:01\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0that means parsing the string though  \n14:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You can do it in velocity.
