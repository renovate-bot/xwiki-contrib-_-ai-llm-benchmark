'cannot' \u00a0is the presence of a subject  \n13:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0This action cannot be reverted  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes better indeed  \n13:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0or this action can not be reverted, indeed cannot seems a tiny bit more natural  \n13:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0maybe something about USAnglais, lots of forms are considered good enough and we tend to get very good at interpreting meaning even without knowing it  \n13:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0interstingly we also have \"platform.wiki.currentwiki.invitationCancelFailure=Error, you can not cancel this invitation.\" .. should I update this, too ?  \n13:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0haha, that's one which I wrote myself without any input  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0me talk english too :)  \n13:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0b/c I wrote the invitation app  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that USAnglais ;)  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: yes you could update it too  \n13:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well it's interesting because it came from me without any suggestion to skew my mind  \n13:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0platform.wiki.currentwiki.invitationCancelFailure=Error, this invitation cannot be cancelled. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<-- most correct IMO  \n13:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, doing so, and then have to update screenshots, sigh, how this is the only chnage ;)  \n13:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally it's hard for me to process \"you can not cancel \u2026\" because I read \"you can\" then I have to read the \"not\" and revert what I was thinking ;)  \n13:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\\*shrug\\* to me this is to the point of pediantry, English just isn't that strict  \n13:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0at least in the US  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's like code styling  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's important when you wish to share your code  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(share= have others work on it)  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: thanks again for working on this important issue, it's great that we've now more protection against mistakes :)  \n13:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0thanks ... just still need to finish the last bits ;) \u00a0thanks for proofreading, in any case  \n13:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's nice to see how relatively evenly we're participating to the BFD :) http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10352#Pie-Chart/13614  \n13:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the top 5-6)  \n13:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, and that invitation text is in another WikiManager.Translations, that one for the sub wikis ... I just stared at the code and could not find it :D  \n13:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, seems jenkins is more complaining about \u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/4a9a96b435085d69186a7915256bc12991c07e16 instead ?  \n13:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0asks for minimal better test coverage there ....  \n15:00\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:03\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:17\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0does anyone know why on the latest snapshot we have \"org.xwiki.rendering.macro.MacroExecutionException: Nested scripts are not allowed  \n16:29\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:30\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:37\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:40\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n17:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n17:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, anyone know if these translation props https://gist.github.com/vmassol/031d3b34e4da6c8c4723 are used anymore?
