The only reason I wanted access to the configuration was for things which are currently static but should be dynamic like \"XWiki\", \"xredirect\" and such.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [vmassol] Hi Caleb  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:41): None of those things are critical.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [vmassol] ok then they should be retrieved from their associated domain module  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [vmassol] for example for XWiki that would be ModelConfiguration  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [vmassol] s/XWiki/\"XWiki\"/  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [vmassol] err actually it's not the right module  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [vmassol] don't know what \"XWiki\" is  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [vmassol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [vmassol] is it the space where users are stored?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:42): Yes.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [vmassol] if so then it should be retrieved from the authentication module's configuration component when we have one  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:43): If there is no problem with people getting the captcha wrong and thus not being told that the username they chose is taken, then those things are not necessary.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:43): [vmassol] you don't need config for that IMO  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [vmassol] and yes being told that the name is already taken is a good thing to have  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:44): That was referring to the other two methods.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [vmassol] ok  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:44): Actually I could do a rough check using exists, but it wouldn't support regex or the superuser's name.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:45): Something else: can you get me in to the incubator.myxwiki so I can have a look at their registration mockup?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:45): user: http://www.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/CalebJamesDeLisle  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:50): [vmassol] Caleb: done  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (09:51): Thanks.

What is the ip address for conference.jabber.org? I have a couple of dns servers and none can find it.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:39): It's odd because I have my isp's dns server, opendns and my own caching dns server, nobody can give me the address.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:40): Even nwtools.com can't get the address... \u00a0????  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 11:05  \nLukemon joined #xwiki at 12:22  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 13:08  \nxwiki-bridge left at 13:09 (Remote closed the connection  \nxwiki-bridge joined #xwiki at 13:09  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:09): \\* sdumitriu has set the subject to: XWiki Chat - http://www.xwiki.org/  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:09): [jvdrean] the checker only monitors the process, not the actual connections; I've restarted it manualluy  \nsdumitriu - (13:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: Don't know if you received this, since the bridge has been dead  \nsdumitriu - (13:10): (11:58:48 AM) sdumitriu: Hm strange:  \nsdumitriu - (13:10): ping conference.jabber.org  \nsdumitriu - (13:10): ping: unknown host conference.jabber.org  \nsdumitriu - (13:10): (11:59:21 AM) sdumitriu: jabber.org is 208.68.163.220  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:10): Hmm.  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:11): [sdumitriu] Caleb, I'd like to push faster the object loading improvement  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:11): [sdumitriu] What's the status on it?  \nsdumitriu left at 13:11 (Client Quit  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:12): It works, in order to apply it, there has to be a change made to the way ListProperty.equals works  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:14): Basically what happens is Hibernate compares a ListProperty to a BaseProperty and because the BaseProperty has no listValue there is an NPE.  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:19): [vmassol] fyi finishing a new large refactoring to use references.

(I would send a mail for a vote as soon as I clearify it a bit and make sure it has more chances to converge)  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:17): [vmassol] lucaa: \"only\"? What else is there?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:18): [lucaa] in sergiu's proposal is also access to class definitions and property definitions with similar syntax  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:18): [lucaa] which is not needed ftm so we could postpone it  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:18): [lucaa] (I mean I don;t need it and I don't know of somebody else)  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:19): [sdumitriu] Yes, we can drop class reference for the moment  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:19): [lucaa] s/access/reference/  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:19): [lucaa] also, vmassol, any new ideas for the multivalued references?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:19): [sdumitriu] Well, one thing to decide is whether we want ^classname as a reference or not  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:20): [lucaa] you mean not indexed?  \nLukemon left at 14:20 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:20): [sdumitriu] We can solve the \"indexed\" issue by saying that ^classname is not valid, and ^classname[index] is the actual full reference, it's not an indexed thing  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:20): [glerouge] CalebJamesDeLisle: should be ok now  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:21): [glerouge] (accessing incubator)  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:21): [lucaa] yes, we had a discussion with vmassol about that. To say that className[objnumber] is the value of an object ref and it would need to be handled by whoever can understand it  \nsunny\\_slls joined #xwiki at 14:21  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:21): [lucaa] this is another option, which would integrate better with a potential plan of giving names to objects, making them accessible through more precise refs than index in an array  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:22): [sdumitriu] That's too big  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:22): [lucaa] sdumitriu: talking to me?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:22): glerouge: Yes, thank you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I likes my xchat.  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:22): [sdumitriu] Yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:22): [sdumitriu] Hm, we could use the guid  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:22): hi everybody  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:22): [sdumitriu] Hi sunny\\_slls  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:23): [lucaa] sdumitriu: how would guid integrate with existing APi?

 \nxwiki-bridge - (14:24): [lucaa] vmassol: using it as an object name  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:24): [vmassol] definitely not  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:24): [vmassol] guid are technical ids  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:24): [vmassol] not meant for human beings  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:25): [sdumitriu] Gotta go  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:25): [sdumitriu] bbl  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:25): [lucaa] sdumitriu: how much later?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [lucaa] in the idea that an entity reference, as it is now, will have a getPosition() and return always 0 to it,  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:27): [lucaa] another option to solve docref^className is to handle it as any other non indexed reference, meaning to return 0 for position, in which case it would mean \"first\" object of that class in the referenced doc  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:28): [lucaa] however, there is an implementation detail that will make that hard to achieve, namely the way the object indexes are assigned and interpreted (the only object of a type in the doc is not necessarily with index 0)  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:30): [lucaa] so, because of this, maybe it's better to use className[objnumber] as an \"object name\" and have the user of this reference interpret its value, it could handle 'className' value as the 'first' object of that class, regardless of the actual index  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:33): [vmassol] lucaa: I like considering \"classname[whatever]\" as the name but it has some drawbacks: you need to reimplement: resolver, serializer + data object to hold the resolved values  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:34): [lucaa] vmassol: I know, that's the bad part of it  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:34): [lucaa] I just had another idea: add isMultivalued() (or a decent name) to EntityReference and assign semantic to getPosition() only when isMultivalued() returns true  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:34): [lucaa] I don't like it, but it would solve the issue  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:35): [vmassol] that's what I was saying the other day  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:35): [lucaa] (and give more info to caller about the original ref)  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:35): [vmassol] but \u00a0a clean impl of this has 2 classes  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:35): [vmassol] EntityReference + IndexedEntityReference   \nxwiki-bridge - (14:35): [lucaa] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:35): [lucaa] is that bad?  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:36): [vmassol] no  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:36): [vmassol] it just need to be designed  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:36): [vmassol] having casts is not a sign a good design  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:36): [vmassol] s/a good/of good/  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:37): [vmassol] so the current api would need to be revisited in light of this and a proposal made  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:37): [lucaa] well no, it would just be EntityRef as interface with 2 aditional functions: isMultivalued() and getPosition()  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:37): [vmassol] a proposal that would preferably not have the user use a cast  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:39): [vmassol] maybe a cast would be ok though  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:41): [lucaa] well, I don't like the idea of a cast either  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:41): [lucaa] cast would be nice if casting would allow getting additional information, but in this case, not casting would mean losing information  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:41): [lucaa] getting an incomplete reference  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:44): [vmassol] not sure we're talking about the same thing, the cast would give you access to getPosition()   \nxwiki-bridge - (14:44): [vmassol] you wouldn't loose information  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:55): [lucaa] what I mean is that a user that doesn't know he has to cast to indexed ref or try to cast or so on, would get incomplete information from that entity reference, all object references would be the same for him  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:55): [lucaa] I don't think I can express that very well  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:55): [vmassol] well that's the point of interfaces :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:55): [vmassol] to provide a given view of something  \nEnygma`1 joined #xwiki at 14:55  \nEnygma` left at 14:56 (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:56): [vmassol] but indeed as I said the api needs to be revisited in view of this if you want to go ahead with this  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:56): [lucaa] but in this case, this view, provides a truncated view, and I don't think it;s the right place to have that  \nEnygma`1 is now known as Enygma` (n=Enygma`@92.83.185.60  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:57): [lucaa] I want to go ahead with something that would enable object references, I don't have very strong preferences, I'm trying to find the best way  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:57): [vmassol] lucaa: it may not be a problem. When you build an ObjectReference you'd get the typed object returned  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:58): [vmassol] the only potential \"issue\" is when you use the generic api  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:58): [lucaa] ah, right, we have special implementations for all ref types  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:08): [lucaa] vmassol: however, for the same reason (that we'd have ObjectReference interface), if we use className[index] as the name of an object reference, all the intermediary types & code used for handling the className[index] value would be hidden to the user: it's just more code, but it's a nicer interface. It would still be problematic if handled with the generic api though  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:17): [vmassol] lucaa: I don't understand  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:18): [lucaa] I mean the problem of parsing & serializing className[objectnumber] strings, if used as name of the object reference, would be hidden from the API caller behind the ObjectReference API  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [lucaa] the only problem with this approach (considering className[objnumber] as the ref name) is that it would require more code, but it won't be a burden for the API caller if he uses the ObjectReference  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:19): [lucaa] so it's kindof the same from the API pov...  \nsunny\\_slls left at 15:19 (\"?? \" ?? ???? ????? \" ??\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [vmassol] lucaa: I wouldn't like to do that  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [vmassol] for lots of reason  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [vmassol] one of which is that you can have an invalid ObjectReference constructed  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [vmassol] and you'll only know when you use it  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:21): [vmassol] this violates the rule we've set so far on references  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [lucaa] \"invalid\" such as?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [vmassol] example:  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:22): [vmassol] \"someclass[stringhere]\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] actually we could check in the constructor  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] we could do the parsing there  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] so forget that  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:23): [vmassol] still it doesn't look right  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:24): [vmassol] on a different topic, can someone confirm that BaseElement.getName() is always a document reference?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:28): [vmassol] and that it represents the reference to the document where it's located  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:28): [vmassol] (be it an object or a class)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:43): [lucaa] vmassol: I just sent a resuming mail about the proposal, can you log your votes in it, please?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:48): [CalebJamesDeLisle] vmassol: You said in your email reply that registration should definitely be a template (not an application) because someone might want to register without a database. I'm wondering how registration would work without a database?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:49): [jvdrean] CalebJamesDeLisle: read: without anything imported in the database  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:50): [jvdrean] but indeed a well configured database is required  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:50): [CalebJamesDeLisle] Yes. without a database you get a big 500 error (which I would like to do something about sometime)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:54): [glerouge] he means without importing the default XAR (or any XAT)  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:54): [vmassol] lucaa: you didn't sent a vote mail just a proposal  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:54): [vmassol] s/sent/send/  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:54): [lucaa] ok, resending as vote  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:55): [sdumitriu] Back  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:55): [CalebJamesDeLisle] Without the default XAR, the system treats everyone as admin so they can import it am I correct?  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:56): [vmassol] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:56): [vmassol] CalebJamesDeLisle: if you get an error starting XE with an empty DB then we have a bug that needs to be fixed. It used to work fine  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:57): [lucaa] sdumitriu: there's a mail now (should arrive as a vote mail right away), could you reply to it, please? thanks a lot  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:57): [CalebJamesDeLisle] With no db to connect to was what I meant.  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:58): [vmassol] CalebJamesDeLisle: well with no DB it's normal!  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:58): [vmassol] XE requires a DB to work  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:58): [CalebJamesDeLisle] It would be nice if it put up a page to help the user specify a db.  \nxwiki-bridge - (15:58): [vmassol] (obviously a better error message would be nice of course ;))  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:00): [CalebJamesDeLisle] So your case for wanting the registration to be a template is that a user may want to create their own wiki without importing the standard XAR?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:00): [sdumitriu] Yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:02): [CalebJamesDeLisle] Thanks. I just wanted to have an understanding because my maniacal tenancy for cleanliness and modularity dislikes the whole template system :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:04): [sdumitriu] Hi florinciu, the title for XOFFICE-188 is not very clear, could you make it better, or explain what it means? It looks a bit like internal technical details, but issue names should be meaningful for the users  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:04): [sdumitriu] Yes Caleb, ideally the whole UI should be defined inside the wiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:05): [glerouge] CalebJamesDeLisle: indeed, a wizard to let the user configure the DB of his choice would be very cool   \nxwiki-bridge - (16:05): [sdumitriu] But the wiki should work without having documents  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:05): [sdumitriu] Still, we're good since we allow all the templates to be redefined inside the wiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:07): [CalebJamesDeLisle] I feel like the hardcoded stuff should be just enough to bootstrap the soft stuff but I understand the value in a wiki working without any documents.  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:08): [glerouge] CalebJamesDeLisle: note that in practice this hardly ever happens (using a wiki with no documents at all)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:16): [florinciu] hi sdumitriu: MSO 10 is a section in the Word output file. I'm not sure if i'll use it directly of translate it somehow. Therefor I opened the issue as a task, strictly for dev needs. But i agree I could find a more friendlier name.  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:17): [vmassol] glerouge: it happens all the time  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:17): [vmassol] whenever someone installs xwiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:18): [vmassol] (installs for real I mean, not playing with the standalone installer which is not for production)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:19): [CalebJamesDeLisle] You mean it is that way until the user imports the default documents?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:20): [sdumitriu] The user (admin) might not want to import the default documents  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:20): [sdumitriu] Who needs a blog, and a dashboard?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:21): [sdumitriu] We don't have a modular application manager, which would allow to pull modules as needed/wanted  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:21): [vmassol] CalebJamesDeLisle: yes it is  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:21): [vmassol] you install the WAR  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:21): [vmassol] you start XE  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:21): [vmassol] you go the admin page  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:21): [vmassol] you import the default XAR  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:21): [vmassol] you remove what you don't need  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:21): [vmassol] ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:22): [CalebJamesDeLisle] If I were in charge :) I would have only enough in templates to import a document bundle.  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:22): [vmassol] CalebJamesDeLisle: yes. Ok you're in charge now!  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:23): [vmassol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:23): [vmassol] that said you should consider that is the bare minimal wiki that would work  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:23): [vmassol] s/wiki/XAR/  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:23): [vmassol] s/that is/what is/  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:24): [vmassol] right now it's an empty one  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:24): [vmassol] we could imagine an Admin XAR (we talked about it in the past) that would contain the minimal stuff  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:25): [CalebJamesDeLisle] It seems like a good idea to have an XAR which has the minimum.  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:26): [CalebJamesDeLisle] I think the minimum XAR should have more than the templates have now such as user support so not everyone is treated as admin.  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:27): [CalebJamesDeLisle] Should I make up a proposal email?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:27): [vmassol] CalebJamesDeLisle: you could but the pb is that we're quite far from this. It's missing several prereqs  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:28): [CalebJamesDeLisle] Such as?  \nxwiki-bridge - (16:29): [vmassol] recoding the template system, making skin-based templates as performant as file system templates, having an install wizard, the extension manager to name a few (not all are hard-prereqs)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:31): Looks like I got kicked from jabber, sorry about the offensive proposal :)  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:13 (\"Leaving\"  \nEnygma` left at 20:28 (\"Leaving.\"  \narkub joined #xwiki at 21:31  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 21:53  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 23:18  \nCalebJamesDeLisl left at 23:27 (  \n\n"}
