I just change the Attachment Storage to file system in xwiki.cfg like discribed in the wiki page Attachments  \n11:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ZFS is a filesystem, completely seperate from XWiki  \n11:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's good at handling very very large amounts of data and high loads  \n11:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS  \n11:08\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n11:08\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Oh thanks for the link.  \n11:09\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:09\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0I created a exta LVM for the /var and put there also the file storage  \n11:10\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0It all runs in a virtual machine. So if I need to expand the /var I just added a other vmdk to the LVM to increase the file space.  \n11:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Sounds good  \n11:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Something to keep in mind is if there are multiple versions of an attachment, each is stored in a seperate file rather than using binary diff/patch  \n11:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0for most workloads this makes sense but if you were doing something like video editing where you had very large files and made lots of small changes to them, you might want to back it by a filesystem which has deduplication  \n11:13\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0As the VMDK is stored on a SAN with deduplication it should work in anyway  \n11:13\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0Is just the question how efficent it will be  \n11:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0gdelhumeau: make a pull request and depending on the complexity of the fix we'll decide  \n11:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: ok, I'm doing it  \n11:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the limitation is indeed important  \n11:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0most of the time, the files which change often are small (eg a spreadsheet) and diffing them would introduce it's own performance concerns  \n11:23\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has quit  \n11:25\u00a0<j-simard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:45\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:53\u00a0<Jigar54>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0PR to apply on 5.3 too  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: comment  \n12:00\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0how to get xwiki instance and xwiki context in component? i need to work with several documents and attachments in my component, but injecting XWiki fails  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ:  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0@Inject  \n12:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and you get the XWiki instance from the XWikiContext)  \n12:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: answered  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: and back ;)  \n12:05\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: nice, thanks  \n12:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: OK, I have reverted this part  \n12:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: applied  \n12:13\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0thx  \n12:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have closed the jira and put a comment http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9789  \n12:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:23\u00a0<Jigar54>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:33\u00a0<jbernard\\_>\u00a0Hello everybody !
