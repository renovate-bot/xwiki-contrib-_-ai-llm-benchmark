But be carefull with http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise31M2#HWYSIWYGEditorConfiguration  \n18:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I mean, the wiki pages  \n18:11\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mflorea: OK, thanks  \n18:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the WYSIWYG editor configuration at least  \n18:12\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I think the best is to delete XWiki.WysiwygEditor\\* pages before importing the new ones  \n18:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0due to an issue with xclass upgrade that was fixed by Sergiu in 3.1 final  \n18:13\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0ok  \n18:14\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mflorea: are you aware of an issue in ancient versions of XWiki where one could not use the paste plugin in the WYSIWYG two times in a row ?  \n18:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sounds familiar  \n18:21\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0first time would work OK, then the second time the textarea in the dialog would be disabled  \n18:21\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0happens on a 2.7.1 wiki  \n18:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm, let me search jira  \n18:30\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0didn't find anything  \n18:30\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0note I don't reproduce on trunk  \n18:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I may fix it with http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-4503  \n18:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvelociter: I can't reproduce it with a fresh 2.7.2 and FF 5.0  \n18:51\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mflorea: OK I will do more test. Just for my information fixing it would imply rebuilding the WYSIWYG or this is just server side stuff ?  \n18:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it's \\*only\\* client side, so the WYSIWYG editor needs to be rebuilt  \n18:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0moreover, the changes I made to XWIKI-4503 are important so porting the fix to 2.7.1 is not trivial  \n18:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0let me check with an older FF version on 2.7.2  \n18:55\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0ok thanks forthe details  \n18:57\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:13\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0Ok, boneheaded question coming up: if I have \"$msg.get('platform.core.profile.section.links')\" on my profile template, it displays as \"External Links\" when the page is rendered. \u00a0Where is that set? \u00a0I'd like the ability to change it.  \n19:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvelociter: I can reproduce it with FF3 on 2.7.2 but it works fine with FF5. The best option IMO is to upgrade FF  \n19:15\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mflorea: OK  \n19:17\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Spazholio: there are two options (1) Extract ApplicationResources.properties file matching your language from the xwiki-core jar(or xwiki-oldcore on newer XE versions) that is found in WEB-INF/lib and copy it to WEB-INF/classes. Then you edit it, look for the platform.core.profile.section.links key and change its value. Finally restart the server.  \n19:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0or, option (2), you can define a translation bundle in a wiki page as indicated in http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/InternationalizingApplications and there you overwrite the platform.core.profile.section.links with the desired value.  \n19:22\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0Same would go for adding in additional sections in the Profile screen?  \n19:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0if you care about i18n then yes. You can alway put the text directly in the template of course, e.g. replace \"$msg.get('platform.core.profile.section.links')\" with \"External Links\" , but it will be the same in all languages.  \n19:31\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0Perfect, thanks. \u00a0At least I wasn't overlooking something that was staring me in the face.  \n19:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you're welcome  \n19:34\u00a0<StefanM>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n19:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:54\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:43\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:12\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:17\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:28\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:30\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n22:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0I'm currently using the following in a panel: \"#set($bookmarks = \"$xwiki.getUserPreference('bookmarks')\")\" \u00a0It seems to return the \"bookmark\" preference (which is a textbox, identical to the Address preference) for the user just fine, but the formatting is a little weird whenever I have a wikilink in there. \u00a0Any ideas why that is, or is there something I can do about it?  \n22:28\u00a0<Spazholio>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/e6wdAE9W \u00a0<-- example of what I see in the panel's source  \n23:58\u00a0<Xnewbie>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
