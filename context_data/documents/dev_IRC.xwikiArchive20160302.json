So we can map a project's role to something in Xwiki. But it also means that the cn=xwiki-users may appear several time in the ldap search.  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so it's not all users, just an extract :)  \n11:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0WikiTemplateTest.createWikiFromTemplateTest is failing for some time, age 36  \n11:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the problem is:  \n11:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0looks like some reference resolver issue  \n11:32\u00a0<VarunJain>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think it's a bug in a resolver but looks like document copy does not probably refactor the class reference in the copied object and keep the source wiki reference  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which produce invalid objects in document since object can only be instance of the class in the same wiki than the document right now  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/probably refactor/pproperly refactor/  \n11:47\u00a0<M-jsimard>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: then it's strange this was not caught earlier, in 8.0M2, the only recent change to the copy code is the part that updates the parent field, introduced by Enygma`, but I don't see how this could have affected the object class reference.  \n11:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I will check  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no idea but resolver themself did not changed in a very long time and are quite covered by unit tests so I would not bet on it :)  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure where is the bug but at least the issue is that the copied object keep the old class reference  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0its probably a bug in XWikiDocument  \n11:50\u00a0<M-fs\\_IVJRUkJ3d2V>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:51\u00a0<M-fs\\_IVJRUkJ3d2V>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it's a flickering that happen more often that it used to (something that was hidding an old bug)  \n11:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:00\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: that test started failing AFAIR during the recent period when xwiki-platform build was failing due to the changes tmortagne was working on XWIKI-12978 (I believe). A lot of other stuff was masked in those failures, including some test setups that I failed to cherry-pick from the 7.4.x branch.  \n12:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I saw that failing test, but assumed it was related to tmortagne's changes.  \n12:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the test was not failing for 8.0M2  \n12:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes a lot of changes have been hidden by the mess in jenkins I produce with my stuff :)  \n12:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I guess it`s hard to tell without debugging  \n12:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep looks like the kind of thing that will need to be reproduced in debug mode  \n12:45\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n12:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:01\u00a0<siddharth>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:02\u00a0<siddharth>\u00a0Hi developers  \n13:03\u00a0<siddharth>\u00a0I was trying to compile android-authenticator project on my system  \n13:04\u00a0<siddharth>\u00a0I am getting an import error from \"import static org.xwiki.android.authenticator.AccountGeneral.sServerAuthenticate\"  \n13:05\u00a0<siddharth>\u00a0particularly because there is no sServerAuthenticatate in AccountGeneral.java  \n13:05\u00a0<siddharth>\u00a0I need some help on this  \n13:05\u00a0<siddharth>\u00a0thanks  \n13:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0siddharth: looking  \n13:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0siddharth: where do you get that error ?

I want to sort the list by creation date. Makes it also easier to see the new proposals. Think it could result to lower interest? :)  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0siddharthsingh: the next step I think is to play a bit with XWiki so that you see what it really is :)  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: it's ok it got 3 proposal already :)  \n14:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0:) so you`re happy  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well not 3 proposal yet but 3 people motivated enough to register to the mailing list ;)  \n14:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: it`s still 1st in the list :D  \n14:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the perks of doing things on time :)  \n14:58\u00a0<siddharthsingh>\u00a0So basically the work of this project is to create a service to generate contacts and sync them regularly  \n14:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0siddharthsingh: yep, as a bonus also update user profile with modification in a contact  \n14:58\u00a0<siddharthsingh>\u00a0yeah  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0plus any other option like filtering which user you want to get (users from some XWiki group, etc)  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0whatever that come to mind in the given timeframe  \n14:59\u00a0<siddharthsingh>\u00a0kind of a social wiki platform?  \n15:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not a huge project in term of features but important thing is to make it as clean and standard as possible and make as easy as possible to use it for another application that would want to access a XWiki instance  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example someone writing an android application to manipulate some data on XWiki (like the blog, tasks, etc.) could just propose the user to select one of the XWiki account he registered on his phone  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the target basically  \n15:04\u00a0<siddharthsingh>\u00a0just like what google does with their apps  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n15:05\u00a0<siddharthsingh>\u00a0will this be done by a normal rest api or a oauth2 authentication?  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now standard XWiki only provide BASIC auth and a REST API, see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/get/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's possible to install custom authenticators on XWiki  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but if possible I would like this app to work on any XWiki instance  \n15:08\u00a0<siddharthsingh>\u00a0and would the work on this project also include what you said like 'manipulate some data on XWiki (like the blog, tasks, etc.)' or is there a seperate application for that?  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no, just need to make sure it's possible and document it for others  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it will require some tricks since Android authenticator API is very oauth oriented but should be doable (it does not require oauth behind the scene, it's just designed to follow the same process than oauth)  \n15:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:25\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:30\u00a0<siddharthsingh>\u00a0for the contact synchronisation thing, will there be a ui to select and add particular contacts only to the phone?
