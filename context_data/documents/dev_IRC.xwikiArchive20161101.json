I'm guessing it could be one of the plugins I installed?  \n18:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0zizz: \u00a0looks like some extension is broken  \n18:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0data-gramm\\_id \u00a0... hmm  \n18:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0is this from viewing the page in the wiki editor ?  \n19:00\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0ClemensR: I'm editing it in the editor and when I save I can see it. If then I edit it again in \"source\" mode I can remove it, preview and save without the code  \n19:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, you work completely inside the WYSIWYG-Editor  \n19:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0are there any macros on the page? \u00a0or does it happen on every page?  \n19:01\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0I'm starting off with a blank page  \n19:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, I guess if you go in source mode, remove it, then go back in normal mode, it comes back again?  \n19:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0normal edit mode, I mean  \n19:02\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0let me try  \n19:04\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0ClemensR: it comes back if I make any changes after getting back to WYSIWYG mode not before  \n19:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0oh, ok, only if you change something .... this stats to look strange  \n19:09\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0I guess it would be useful to state that one of the extensions I installed was Visual Realtime Collaborative Editor  \n19:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0which xwiki version is it, actually, and which browser are you using?  \n19:11\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0XWiki 8.3 and Chrome latest stable  \n19:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, I see some mentioning of the \"mceContentBody\" \u00a0in the javascript code, wondering where that comes from  \n19:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0mce was retired quite some time ago  \n19:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I mean the use of it within XWiki  \n19:15\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0I see, can I help somehow?  \n19:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, can you check if the problem goes away if you uninstall that realtime collaborative editor, or some other extension?  \n19:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0still looks curious, like if some javascript went mad  \n19:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0unfortunately it is getting late here in my timezone, so I gotta go soon  \n19:20\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0I'll uninstall that one and seee  \n19:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I just checked if that javascript is in some XWiki core code or one of the common extensions, but nope  \n19:23\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0ClemensR: it didn't go away with the realtime editor  \n19:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, this extension also needs some UI to get \"imported\"  \n19:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the one via \u00a0./do --post Admin:[[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):8080/xwiki  \n19:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0not sure if that is still lingerign around and runining \u00a0your installation  \n19:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but, anyway, this editor does not contain a snippet that looks the the one which get inserted in the editor  \n19:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe one of the extension is a custom layout / skin ?  \n19:25\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0is there a way to export a list of instaled extensions?  \n19:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0actually there is a section in the admin labeled \"installed extensions\", but I guess this also lists the \"build in extensions\" \u00a0that are already pre-installed, so it might not be exactly useful in your case  \n19:30\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0I know I'm looking at it right now  \n19:31\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0\"javax.inject\" this looks suspicious  \n19:31\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0installed as dependency apparentyl  \n19:32\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0or not, seems it's for java not js  \n19:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you have an data/extension/repository in your \"permanent\" dir, you can check that for stuff not starting with org%2Exwiki%2Eplatform  \n19:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yup, the javax.inject is a library needed for internal programming stuff  \n19:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0these should be the directories storing code which has been installed as UI-components and extensions  \n19:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0unfortunately the bundles ones, too, but at least without the gazillion java compontents  \n19:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0s/bundles/bundled/  \n19:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0darn, it is really too late here, I gotta run  \n19:34\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0ok, thanks for help anyway  \n19:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hope you find the source of the problem, otherwise see you tomorrow  \n19:35\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0sure, take care  \n19:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n20:36\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0is now known as <ww3election2016>  \n20:37\u00a0<ww3election2016>\u00a0is now known as <Daemoen>  \n20:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:24\u00a0<zizz>\u00a0has quit  \n22:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit\n"}
