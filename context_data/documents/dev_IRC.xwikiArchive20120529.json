I had issue uploading the xar yesterday, and decided to try the superadmin  \n00:00\u00a0<ries>\u00a0later it turned out this was a glassfish issue  \n00:01\u00a0<ries>\u00a0today I just logged in as superadmin to continue...  \n00:01\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n00:01\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes, there is a issue with attachments on glassfish afaik  \n00:01\u00a0<ries>\u00a0but indeed, Admin / admin worked\u2026 but not before the XAR was imported  \n00:01\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0Admin is more than enought to do all you want with XWiki :)  \n00:01\u00a0<ries>\u00a0this seems to be very powerfull..  \n00:02\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0well when you donload the WAR, that's the platform (backend) .. and the XAR is the Enterprise part, which comes with the applications, users, etc  \n00:02\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0\\*download  \n00:02\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n00:02\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I have limited experience with wiki's though, just CMS systems. But I do use mediawiki on my pet projects website, but xwiki has just way more features  \n00:02\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but if you just want to play, I recommend jetty + hsqldb package  \n00:03\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes, it has a lot and it's possible to develop new ones usnig the API  \n00:03\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I already have glassfish and postgresql running, so it's easer for me to tun it from the war  \n00:03\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0it's very extensible  \n00:03\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I see  \n00:03\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0any particular reasons for using glassfish ?  \n00:04\u00a0<ries>\u00a0we have all our applications running on glassfish, and we know it mostly  \n00:05\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I am not much famiar with tomcat and I only know jetty by name  \n00:05\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0well as far as I know, both are more simpler and lightwight than glassfish  \n00:05\u00a0<ries>\u00a0glassfish just hase a very nice administration interface :D  \n00:05\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0ok, now I understand better :D  \n00:05\u00a0<ries>\u00a0haha  \n00:06\u00a0<ries>\u00a0we also have glassfish running, 3 clusters and 2 nodes  \n00:06\u00a0<ries>\u00a0it's just very easy to do that\u2026.  \n00:06\u00a0<ries>\u00a0properly also possible with tomcat and jetty, it's just that we never used it. Glassfish worked fine for us  \n00:07\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n00:30\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0has quit  \n00:39\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n01:14\u00a0<Shaddox>\u00a0has quit  \n02:54\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n03:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n03:48\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: The upload issue was indeed due to the glassfish bug, I patched glassfish and everything worked after  \n03:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi ries  \n03:49\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Good to hear  \n04:12\u00a0<jssolichin>\u00a0has quit  \n04:27\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sdumitriu: Tomorrow I will play with it for a half a day\u2026 see what I can do with xwiki  \n05:09\u00a0<ries>\u00a0To understand how the Dashboard work is that in the Administrators guide or users guide? Also, do I need a Dashboard?  \n05:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think users  \n05:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And it depends on how you use your wiki  \n05:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's useful if you have several users and want to keep track of what's going on  \n05:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But you can just use Main.Dashboard, you don't need to keep the homepage busy  \n05:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Although you could invest some time into making a very good Dashboard setup useful for everybody, like a quick place to find all the useful information about the project  \n05:15\u00a0<ries>\u00a0Currently for example in Spaces I see 'Dashboard' and I am not sure why users need that in that list  \n05:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, yes, that one could be marked as hidden  \n05:16\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I tried it with permissions :) that didn't work well yet...  \n05:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Nope, that's not good  \n05:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In 4.1 there would be better hiding  \n05:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In 4.0 and earlier it's harder to mark documents as hidden  \n05:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ah, you have to keep in mind that the Admin account sees a lot more than normal users  \n05:18\u00a0<ries>\u00a0I have two browsers open  \n05:18\u00a0<ries>\u00a0one logged in, and a other one not logged in  \n05:19\u00a0<ries>\u00a0in the xwiki website, shoulkd I then search for 'how to hide a space'  \n05:19\u00a0<ries>\u00a0or 'How to hide a page'  \n05:20\u00a0<ries>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/How+can+I+hide+a+space+for+some+users  \n05:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Quicker answer: edit templates/xwikivars.vm and see the $blacklistedSpaces variable  \n05:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Right, you found it before me  \n05:23\u00a0<ries>\u00a0works fine for me...  \n05:30\u00a0<ries>\u00a0Last question for tonight..  \n05:30\u00a0<ries>\u00a0What is the proper why to edit 'It's an easy-to-edit website that will help you work better together.....'  \n05:30\u00a0<ries>\u00a0Each time I want to edit it it states that I change it for all pages  \n05:31\u00a0<ries>\u00a0sburjan told me to use 'Inoine Edit' but then I just see a large 'blue' area that cannot be edited  \n05:31\u00a0<ries>\u00a0no sorry, when I use WYSIWYG  \n05:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0That's a widget, I think it's in Main.Welcome  \n05:46\u00a0<ries>\u00a0But, do I type that into the URL, or is there a link that brings me there? \u2026 Just to understand..  \n05:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Try pressing Ctrl+G  \n05:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n05:53\u00a0<ries>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n06:23\u00a0<CIA-87>\u00a0Caleb James DeLisle\u000f master\u000f \\* r795517a\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/795517ae69d43eca4e985b54c8c5d92c276ea941 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-wysiwyg/xwiki-platform-wysiwyg-war/pom.xml :\u000f Reverting because it doesn't fix the issue. - http://git.io/X2QJeg  \n07:40\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n07:42\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:20\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n08:22\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:05\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n09:07\u00a0<CIA-87>\u00a0Andreas Jonsson\u000f master\u000f \\* ree31c9a\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/ee31c9ada88554eea7a904e1eab307a876678336 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-wysiwyg/xwiki-platform-wysiwyg-war/pom.xml :\u000f XWIKI-7861: Fix for release failure.
