First I tried casting to ElementCSSInlineStyle but it seems that xerces's ElementImpl doesn't implement this interface. Then I tried to parse the value of the style attribute with http://cssparser.sourceforge.net/ but I get an empty style object.. and CSS4j works only with DOM4j afaics. Any hints?  \nmflorea - (13:31): cssparser is almost undocumented  \nsdumitriu - (13:32): Sorry, can't help you with that without going into the code  \nmflorea - (13:33): np, I tried to look over the code myself but the parser code seems to be automatically generated from a grammar  \nmflorea - (13:33): I'll dig further, thanks anyway  \nvmassol left at 13:34 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu left at 14:13 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 15:01  \ntmortagne left at 15:01 (Client Quit  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 16:16  \nxwikibot joined #xwiki at 17:37  \nmflorea left at 18:10 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 18:47  \ntmortagne left at 19:10 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol left at 20:23 (Quit: Leaving.  \nnuvolari joined #xwiki at 20:27  \nnuvolari left at 20:28 (Changing host  \nnuvolari joined #xwiki at 20:28  \njfx joined #xwiki at 20:38  \njfx left #xwiki at 20:38  \nflorinciu left at 22:19 (Quit: Leaving.  \n\n"}
