The best tool is the [Filter Application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Filter%20Application). It currently has a module for [importing wiki pages from Confluence](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Filter%20Confluence%20XML%20module).\n\nAlso note that XWiki supports writing wiki pages in various syntaxes (HTML, wiki syntaxes, etc) and thus it's also possible to directly copy the content of your pages from another wiki into an XWiki page (provided [the syntax used for that other wiki is supported by XWiki](https://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/#HSupportedSyntaxes)). However this would mean importing your content page by page. In addition the XWiki WYSIWYG editor only supports the XWiki syntax at this point so you'd have to use the wiki editor to edit those pages.\n\nThere are also [various extensions related to importing wiki content](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?do=viewTag&tag=migration).\n\nIn addition if you're importing from MediaWiki there's also a [Google Summer of Code application for doing so](https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/sandbox/tree/master/xwiki-wikiimporter) which has never been released and that you'll need to build from sources.\n\n# Importing other type of data\n\nThere are [several extensions related to importing data into XWiki](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?do=viewTag&tag=import):\n\n* Microsoft Excel\n* CSV\n* SharePoint Blogs\n\n\n"}
