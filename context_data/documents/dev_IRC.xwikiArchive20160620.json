(or I am the one missing some knowledge)  \n17:13\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/Bindings+available+inside+the+Custom+Display+property#History  \n17:14\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so it helped me but when you want to change for example colors of the values selected by the user, how do you get the value ?  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$value is the value  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of the property  \n17:14\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0for example I have this list of values : value1=Libre|value2=Occup\u00e9 par ...etc  \n17:15\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0what I manage to get is \"value1\" .. but I want to show \"Libre\"  \n17:15\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0the real value and not it's id  \n17:15\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0not sure if I'm explaining it right ?  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess you have to go through the class  \n17:16\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0and yes I used \"$value\" but here it give me value1 or value2 .. not what I need :s  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$MyClass=$object.getxWikiClass()  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then getProperty(...)  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically get the definition and extract the pretty name using the id  \n17:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, in the example it does only use $listitem for the items in the options  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need somehow to call PropertyClass#getMapValues()  \n17:19\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so I use something like \u00a0: #set($MyClass=$object.getxwikiClass() then #set($Property=$MyClass.getProperty('nameoftheproperty')  \n17:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so \u00a0$MyClass.getMapValues().get($listitem) \u00a0should work to get the \"displayName\" ?  \n17:19\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0the \"displayName\" is the prettyname ?  \n17:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, yes, that is what I meant  \n17:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0darn, I cannot remember the last time I did this ....  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Display+Static+List+Elements  \n17:21\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I'm afraid I'm not very good at java code (or any code for what's matter ^^v)  \n17:22\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok checking this link  \n17:23\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0this code let me use the \"$value\" to get the real displayname/prettyname then ?  \n17:23\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I need to put it at the beggining of my velocity code and it would work if I understand it right ?  \n17:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the code is an example to display all values (in view mode, so to say)  \n17:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so my code snippet to replace $listitem as visible text inside the < option > tag on that page \u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/Bindings+available+inside+the+Custom+Display+property  \n17:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0was even nearly correct, it should just have been: \u00a0\u00a0$MyClass.getMapValues().get($listitem).getValue()  \n17:27\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ah you are the author of this page ?  \n17:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0no  \n17:27\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I admit I havn't understood all your code .. not my \"level\" :s  \n17:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is Pbas  \n17:28\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0basically I only want to show the values on the page in different colors, depending on the value shown  \n17:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, but you can see that the code displays a select box filled with options ... \u00a0ah,  \n17:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so you only want to change the view mode ?  \n17:28\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so if the value is \"free\", it's shown in green whenyou check it in view mode .. or red if it's \"busy\" .. and so on .. no need for change in edit mode of course.  \n17:29\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0and yes , only in view mode  \n17:29\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<M-oren>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0then indeed vmassol's link of http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Display+Static+List+Elements \u00a0is a better starting point  \n17:29\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I started the script with : if ($type == \"view\")  \n17:29\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and \"red\" and \"green\" are the \"prettyPrint\" values ?  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0yes  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0with something like :  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#if ($value != \"Libre\")  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{html clean = \"false\"}}  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<color=green>$value</color>  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{/html}}  \n17:30\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0etc..  \n17:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, the $value is indeed the current value, and you want something like #set($prettyName = $MyClass.getMapValues().get($value).getValue())  \n17:31\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I wanted to have some different colorset for each static list (there are 6 or 7)  \n17:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and then < span style=\"color: $prettyName\">$value</ span> \u00a0\u00a0or such  \n17:32\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so I looked at the custom display instead of changing the sheet  \n17:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0$MyClass as above in the code  \n17:33\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok  \n17:33\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so I set the \"prettyname\" first  \n17:34\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0then call it with the $value .. I will try that, thank you  \n17:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I hope it works :)  \n17:35\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0me too  \n17:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess you will also need a #if ($type = 'edit') \u00a0branch, or the value is no longer editable ...  \n17:35\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0do I need to change something like an #elseif (blablabla) for the edition mode ?  \n17:35\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ah  \n17:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, we are in synch :)  \n17:35\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0lol you just answered me before I asked the question  \n17:36\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0what should I write in the edit branch ? I'm even more lost for this side of the code :s  \n17:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think you can copy the part between the #if and the first #elseif from http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/Bindings+available+inside+the+Custom+Display+property \u00a0for that  \n17:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0unfortunately one cannot call the \"build-in\" edit display in cases like this  \n17:37\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0too bad  \n17:37\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so you have to \"rewrite\" everything in the edit mode ?  \n17:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, as far as I know  \n17:38\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0aww ok  \n17:40\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok trying with what you offered me here .. I'll be back :)  \n17:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0like Schwarzenegger in Terminator =:-?  \n17:43\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0yeah firing lot of questionbullet :p  \n17:54\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I think I'm progressing, now I have the colors ^^ but I think I'm not calling prettyName the right way  \n17:55\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I used it like that : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<span style=\"color:red; display:$prettyName\">$value</span>  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your not using css correctly  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to replace $value with $prettyName  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and display means something else in css)  \n17:59\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok  \n17:59\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0and yes I don't know very well the css, you're right  \n18:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, I though the color is the prettyName in this use case here, but maybe I am the confused one ;)  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know what you want to do :)  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here you're display a text in red  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*displaying  \n18:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0in any case I think it is either <span style=\"color:$prettyName\">$value</span> \u00a0\u00a0or <span style=\"color:$value\">$prettyName</span>  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to be precise: you're displaying the technical id in red  \n18:10\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0ok  \n18:12\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so I have static list, with 17 values, presented like that : value1=Libre|value2=Occup\u00e9 par A|value3=Occup\u00e9 par B|value4=Occup\u00e9 par C|value5=Occup\u00e9 par D|value6=Occup\u00e9 par .... and so on  \n18:13\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I want for example that if the value1 is selected, then it will be displayed in green on the \"view\" .. but if it's another value (C,D,E ....) it will be displayed in red  \n18:13\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so I will either display \"Libre\" in green or \"Occup\u00e9 par xx\" in red, in view mode only  \n18:13\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0no change needed in edit mode (it's perfect)  \n18:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, but then where to you have the color values ? I mean the mapping of ids to the color values?  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki\\_finstern: could I ask you your name? (I like to know who I'm talking too and match it with email that people send on the lists - you probably have sent some mails there I guess ;))  \n18:14\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0so yes, as for now, I managed to display the technical id, in green or red  \n18:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the $prettyName is actually text ...  \n18:14\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0not already vmassol, but it's emmanuel klein :)  \n18:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, you can do e.g. <span style=\"color:red\">$prettyName</span> \u00a0to display the pretty name in red  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice to meet you Emmanuel :)  \n18:16\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0until now I have read lot of faq pages and researched in the dev guide and read some guides about velocity at oracle website ..  \n18:16\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0and so on  \n18:17\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0sorry to ask stupid questions, I'm not an experienced developper :)  \n18:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0for velocity I have bookmarked this page, btw: \u00a0http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html  \n18:17\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0Clemens, I tried that, I assumed at first that would work  \n18:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0of course everything is red then, as it is hard wired  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne:  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and all:  \n18:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so the question is: how do you decide which values are green and which are red ?  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems we cannot search anymore locally on dev.xwiki.org  \n18:18\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0in fact Clemens I get a $prettyName in red  \n18:18\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0:D  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I don't remember but maybe it's \"normal\"  \n18:19\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0(I mean, the text is really \"$prettyName\")  \n18:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0even with #set($prettyName = $MyClass.getMapValues().get($value).getValue()) \u00a0\u00a0?  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you mean it's not expected that search goes to main wiki ? I tough it was  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can search on main wiki and then filter only dev wiki results  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no auto suggest and the search seems to be the DB one  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0on main wiki ?  \n18:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is like that for quite some time, the search, I mean  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I get redirected to http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Search?text=&f\\_type=DOCUMENT&f\\_locale=en&f\\_locale=&r=1  \n18:20\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I have this code currently (above is the custom display code for edit mode) :  \n18:20\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0#elseif ($type == \"view\")  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no it's ok acutually  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0once I enter a search term I get the solr result  \n18:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes looks like solr to me  \n18:20\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#set ($prettyName = $MyClass.getMapValues().get($value).getValue())  \n18:20\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#if ($value != 'value1')  \n18:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I see drilldown in the search in the main wiki,so its the solr search  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was expecting solr without entering anyting  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0solr ui that is  \n18:20\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{html clean = \"false\"}}  \n18:21\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<span style=\"color:red\">$prettyName</span>  \n18:21\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0etc..  \n18:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: that's because you are used to end up on this page with a search input already passed :)  \n18:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, ok, but $prettyName is not set?  \n18:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0narf, then the '#set' command does not work as I thought it does  \n18:22\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0[18:18] <+ClemensR> so the question is: how do you decide which values are green and which are red ? : with this : #if ($value != 'value1')  \n18:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, I see, ok  \n18:23\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0and I added \u00a0\u00a0#set ($prettyName = $MyClass.getMapValues().get($value).getValue())  \n18:23\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0just before the \"#if\"  \n18:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so it should work, except that \u00a0$prettyName is not set  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yeah  \n18:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0xwiki\\_finstern: do you have a #set($MyClass=$object.getxWikiClass()), too?
