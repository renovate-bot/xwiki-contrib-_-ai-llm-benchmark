I don't plan to change the keys. So I'll leave the current link for now, ok?  \ntmortagne - (16:39): mflorea: no you should change it for the trunk one anyway, the fact that you don't plan to remove keys just mean we don't need to have a different Transltion File for 2.2 branch  \nmflorea - (16:39): ok  \ntmortagne - (16:39): l10n should always point on trunk  \nvmassol - (16:59): tmortagne: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XASCH-49 is still open.
