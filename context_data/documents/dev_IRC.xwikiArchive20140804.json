I would say XWiki  \n11:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0there is even a test that proves the input stream is not affected, but it may not cover all use cases  \n11:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0rihbyne: There is less contributors so yo could bring more noticable things :)  \n11:49\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: ok.I am searching for open source java projects. and I also wanna tell you that my discovered interest are in distributed computing.  \n11:49\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0so gdelhumeau what you wanna say about it.  \n11:49\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0\\*  \n11:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0rihbyne: see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Contributing . There are many ways you can contribute. XWiki is a web application and platform so knowledge in distributed computing surely helps. I guess you're interested in http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Contributing#HContributeCode  \n11:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you should register on the xwiki-devs mailing list (see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/MailingLists )  \n12:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:02\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has quit  \n12:05\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0sorry guys did I miss anything ?  \n12:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nope, it's fairly quiet today  \n12:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0rihbyne: you can always check the log if you think you missed something, e.g. for today: \u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/xwikiArchive20140804 \u00a0:)  \n12:15\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: \u00a0mflorea ClemensR I have not familiar with xwiki.I want to contribute code so I should join the dev mailing list? also I would like to know the experience involved in apache-commons project and xwiki.  \n12:15\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0\\*am  \n12:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, you can first read the pages about contributing that mflorea has posted above  \n12:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you maybe also want to try to build XWiki from source \u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Building \u00a0... though you can also just download it and try it out and then see of you can improve one of the existing extensions  \n12:20\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0ok yeah ClemensR. but what you have to say on apache-commons?  \n12:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: M1 should be today  \n12:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0last time I talked with Vincent, he asked me to handle the release, either directly, or to find someone  \n12:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ok  \n12:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0rihbyne: well, that are a lot of different smaller projects, mostly libraries. If you want to contribute there I think you need a use case for the library so you understand what this or that library is good for. Then I never contributed to commons (except sending a patch once I think - about typos in the javadoc :))  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ve already started looking into the build/test problems  \n12:29\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0so ClemensR apache-commons libraries are fundamental libraries and one uses them and contributes to them when they need them in their projects?  \n12:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, for example XWiki actually uses some apache-comons libs; you can find them in the webapps/xwiki/WEB-INF/lib subdirectory ... all the files starting with common-\\* :)  \n12:37\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0ok  \n12:40\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has quit  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:12\u00a0<DuFFo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:15\u00a0<sdumitriu2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:19\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:19\u00a0<DuFFo>\u00a0has quit  \n14:19\u00a0<DuFFo\\_>\u00a0is now known as <DuFFo>  \n14:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:01\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:32\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:05\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:29\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:28\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:10\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:31\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:36\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:38\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:48\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
