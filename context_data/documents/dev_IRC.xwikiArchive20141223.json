I had no result, but I found this trick : http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Clean+slashes+from+document+names  \n10:34\u00a0<alex\\_ccr>\u00a0And it works ! :)  \n10:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0good :)  \n10:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:35\u00a0<alex\\_ccr>\u00a0I found it by chance ! I was looking for a way to clean PDF names when we export pages, and I found the way to clean slashes \u00a0:D  \n10:37\u00a0<alex\\_ccr>\u00a0Now I'm good \u00a0:)  \n10:48\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:15\u00a0<alex\\_ccr>\u00a0I've another question : is it possible to force the download of a PDF export instead of reading it in the browser ?  \n11:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I am not sure, but I guess one needs to get rid of the \"Content-Disposition: inline\" header ....  \n11:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0however that is quite hard wired in the ExportAction class, it seems  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:28\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:11\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0How can i make panel shared on all wikis in farm?  \n12:11\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0I try to make navigation more than \"possible\"  \n12:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you edit the XWiki.XWikiPreferenes of the subwikis in the object editor, you can type in a full path to a panel in the main wiki for the left/rigth panels  \n12:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0something like, e.g. \u00a0\u00a0'Panels.Applications,xwiki:Panels.MyGlobalPanel'  \n12:21\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0alright, let's try!  \n12:30\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0great! is it possible to add it as default to all newly created subwikis?  \n12:34\u00a0<alex\\_ccr>\u00a0has quit  \n12:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, either you could add it to a template wiki, and create your sub-wikis from that template ... or ... \u00a0ah, I dont know out of my head if there is a \"wiki created event\" and how to listen for it ...  \n12:44\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0alright. i have to learn this environment step by step.  \n12:44\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0it isn't easy to understand what's going on  \n12:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ClemensR: there is one  \n12:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0unless you create a lot of subwikis the effort to write such a listener is much higher than to set the config up for every subwiki manually, but I gus it is much more fun ;)  \n12:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0depends if janepe is a developer or not  \n12:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0we don't have the same definition of \"fun\" :)  \n12:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0gdelhumeau: ah, ok, did not find it quickly enough in the docs ...  \n12:45\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0I'm kind of beginning  \n12:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, a template wiki might be the simpler solution in any case  \n12:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0+1  \n12:46\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0I'm learning OO design patterns right now. Strategy, Abstract Factory, Decorator, Observer etc.  \n12:47\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0I know few languages but i haven't started writing programs  \n12:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is, you create one special subwiki, that is not really used , and set that \"This is a template wiki\" flag on creation ... then you can adapt stuff there in the XWikiReferences and what else. and use it to create new subwikis  \n12:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that would be the \"zero coding\" solution  \n12:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0however if you want to learn programming with XWiki instead ... ah, let me check the docs ...  \n12:48\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0i'm not going to be illiterate however right now i have problem with setting these preferences manually, so step by step is good solution  \n12:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you could play with the \u00a0event listener tutorial : http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingEventListenerTutorial \u00a0\u00a0if you want an \"automatic\" solution  \n12:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0however I would consider this a \"training exercise\" ... normally setting this stuff up once in a template wiki and then use that template wiki to create more wikis is the way to go  \n12:56\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0ClemensR, this is crazy. I'm editing XWiki.XWikiPreferences in /xwiki/wiki/MySubwiki/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object but changes aren't applied. Itsn't working  \n12:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, did you try with \"save & continue\" ? \u00a0you might see an ajax-request going out and can debug that with developer tools  \n12:57\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0it's saved  \n12:59\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0i mean, i can refresh and see the change in object settings. however this doesn't reflect menus  \n12:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, too bad, I thought it would. Maybe something with view permissions? if the Panel in the mail wiki is not viewable by anonymous users, it might not be visible in the subwiki, either  \n13:00\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0It haven't worked in main wiki too  \n13:00\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0i've set it on main wiki with \"panel wizard\"  \n13:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0janepe: Your use-case cannot work with the panel wizard  \n13:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you need to go to Admin > Presentation  \n13:07\u00a0<octo>\u00a0has quit  \n13:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0then you will have 2 inputs \"leftPanels\" and \"rightPanels\"  \n13:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0do you see them?  \n13:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0in these fields, you can enter the list of panels that you want to display, separated by commas  \n13:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0here, you can put xwiki:Panels.NameOfYourPanel  \n13:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the \"xwiki:\" prefix means \"take it from the main wiki\"  \n13:10\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0there is nothing like that in \"Administration: Presentation\" http://i.imgur.com/CE6iNvY.png; there is XWiki.XWikiPreferences object which i'm editing using ?editor=object  \n13:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the panel wizard is just here to help you to fill these 2 fields, but it does not handle the panels from other wikis, that is why you cannot use it for this use-case  \n13:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0gdelhumeau: Panels input no longer there in the \"Presentation\" menu in 6.3 (at least in my snapshot), that is why I asked to use the object editor instead  \n13:11\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0but as i can see they have default values again. so maybe there is something wrong with saving  \n13:11\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sorry  \n13:11\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's on \"Page Elements\"  \n13:27\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<DuFFo>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<bouquetf>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<FUF>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<benoitc>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<martin-h>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n13:28\u00a0<martin-h>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:06\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:29\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:26\u00a0<janepe>\u00a0has quit  \n17:12\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:30\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:36\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:08\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:28\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:28\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n22:28\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0is now known as <momomomomo>  \n22:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n22:37\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n22:48\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n23:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:42\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit\n"}
