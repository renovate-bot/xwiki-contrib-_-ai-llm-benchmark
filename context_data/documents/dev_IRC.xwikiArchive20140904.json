Some pull them with forceSkinAction  \n14:47\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a02. Some don't  \n14:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a03. Any part of scriptaculous pulls in the others  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: the difference is I was is with the header caching  \n14:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a04. We get scriptaculous twice, once as a file resource and once as a /skin/ resource  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with the skin action, we set: response.setDateHeader(\"Expires\", (new Date()).getTime() + 30 \\* 24 \\* 3600 \\* 1000L);  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what we get without the skin action though  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie cache for 30 days with skin action)  \n14:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a05. I think it might have been required in the past to pull the mains scriptaculous script with parsing enabled, so all the others had to be pulled in the same way  \n14:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But I don't think that's needed anymore  \n14:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And we should even deprecate all usage of scriptaculous  \n14:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It's been unmaintained since 2010  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, since we're late releasing RC1 I won't toucht his now but we can do some cleanup in 6.3  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll create a jira issue  \n14:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0You can definitely fix images  \n14:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It doesn't affect overriding in any way, forceSkinAction is just for velocity parsing  \n14:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And that works only for js/css resources  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and caching  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and less now ;)  \n14:52\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, caching, but I think the file resouce cache is even better  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:52\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And it lets the container apply extra speed improvements  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: actually I was amazed that xwiki works since we're pulling some js files with forceSkinAction  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus have velocity applied on them...  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're just lucky I guess  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex in effects.js there are plenty of $A  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're lucky that no var A is defined in the velocity context  \n14:58\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0created XWIKI-10947  \n14:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0sdumitriu: since i caught you here, could you please answer my comment on http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10568 when you have a few minutes?
