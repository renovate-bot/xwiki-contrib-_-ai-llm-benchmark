The reason is that I want to detect which jars have been build with java 6, to rebuild them with java 5. I searched a bit and I couldn't find anything about this so I guess the only option is to install a 1.5 jre right?  \n08:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: hi. Yes I think so  \n08:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n08:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you can do  \n08:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I think)  \n08:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is tell the java 6 compiler to only use java5 elements  \n08:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it'll still be compiled with java6  \n08:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, but that is at compile time. I'm looking for a way to detect this at run time, i.e. detect which jars have been build with java 5  \n08:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check the java id  \n08:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0java compiler id  \n08:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0is it in the jar?  \n08:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you might have to read the jar as a zip file  \n08:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mean read the file  \n08:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm, I see there is \"Build-Jdk\" property in MANIFEST.MF, I suppose most of the jars will have it.  \n08:27\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:28\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I suppose Build-Jdk: 1.6.0\\_18 and X-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.5 means the jar was build with 1.6 but is compatible with 1.5  \n08:43\u00a0<j-saturne>\u00a0has quit  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: there's still one wysiwyg flickering test: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-wysiwyg/746/testReport/org.xwiki.test.wysiwyg/TabsTest/testSwitchToSourceWithoutHTMLChanges/  \n08:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep, I'll handle it asap  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm this is strange: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests-3.1/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-escaping/84/testReport/  \n08:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0isn't it because the browser didn't start?  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm looing at console: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests-3.1/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-escaping/84/console  \n08:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it says: Tests run: 831, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 82  \n08:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure why tests would be skipped though  \n08:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no browser startezd mflorea  \n08:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the escaping tests)  \n08:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but there' sa browser issue for sure http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests-3.1/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/84/testReport/org.xwiki.test.ui/AllTests/org\\_xwiki\\_test\\_ui\\_AllTests/  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the dislpay seems down again  \n09:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0when the new CI machine will be installed ?  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when it's ready  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's say soon  \n09:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was told yesterday but as you can see it's not there  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so soon is the best I know  \n09:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cool :)  \n09:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0hope that will fix some issues  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would it?  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what issues?  \n09:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it'll just allow to have faster feedback that's all  \n09:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0that's also an issue ;)  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n09:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'd rather we wait a few more days and have iptables rules  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to ping our admin about this.

But nothing Blocker  \n09:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0let's see if I find some today :)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok :)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oracle shouldn't be a blocker for 3.1 IMO  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we didn't introduce any regression for it  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it could be for 3.2  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I need to send the proposal for the 3.2 roadmap  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing it today  \n09:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0do you think it's too early to replace RTF with ODP export in 3.3 ?  \n09:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0we already have ODP explor. all we have is toremove the RTF and set ODP Export tu appear in the menu even when the Oo server is stopped  \n09:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I wish we had a way to rename releases after they are done. This business of releasing again kind of breaks the consept of release candidate.  \n09:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0give codenames to releases ?  \n09:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0or wdym ?  \n09:58\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0do -rc-2 and then if it is good enough then just change the name.  \n09:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That way the final is exactly the same as the accepted candidate, it's even from the same compiler cycle.  \n09:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well depends how we decide. RC1 is for stabilization, but if almost nobody tests it it's released almost blindly like any other M2 or nightly build  \n09:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0err same compilation  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: 3.3?  \n10:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: yes  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: we should be able to do this with build promotion using nexus  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but I haven't investigated how it works and how it could work for our version.properties and metadata info in jar files)  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: 3.3 is not defined yet  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be done in 3.2 if we wanted  \n10:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I know.This is why I'm asking.Does this proposal to slip in 3.3 roadmap ?  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we're defining 3.2 now  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not 3.3  \n10:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I know. I was asking about the future :)  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who knows the future? I don't  \n10:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0we have enough for 3.2. This is why I asked for 3.3  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're only defining one release ahead at this point  \n10:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I know. But there were times when you were saying \"we can do this in 2.x\" .. meaning 1-2 versions in the future.  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what you want me to say  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can say: we could have in 3.3  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's not going to help much  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/have/have it/  \n10:06\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well I was just asking if youconsider fesable and doable in 3.3 :)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I said  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I even consider it feasible for 3.2  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay :)  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I haven't proposed it on the roadmap  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which I've jsut sent  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but roadmap is a minimal roadmap  \n10:07\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:08\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'll think if I'll propose it on the list for 3.2 or wait till 3.3  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: feel free to add stuff that you intedn to do on the roadmap mail  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like cassandra stuff  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bb in 20  \n10:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:22\u00a0<roxxo>\u00a0has quit  \n10:42\u00a0<camaritei>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all builds are broken on agent2  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's because there's some admin work on agent2 going on  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to set up iptables  \n10:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://www.howtoforge.com/chrooted\\_ssh\\_howto\\_debian  \n11:20\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:34\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n11:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: got problem building commons?  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I built it this morning and was ok for me  \n11:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0hi, yes  \n11:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0stable-3.0.x branch?  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I built master  \n11:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.6:check (default) on project xwiki-commons-core: Execution default of goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.6:check failed: Plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.6 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Failure to find org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-verification-resources:jar:1.17-SNAPSHOT in http://maven.xwiki.or  \n11:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0checkstyle deppends on commons-verification-resources:jar:1.17-SNAPSHOT  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think that's because  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we remove old snapshots  \n11:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: looks like stable-3.0.x was badly merged from svn https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/tree/stable-3.0.x  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on the remote repo  \n11:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I see  \n11:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a03.0 should not depends on snapshots  \n11:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it has only commons-core  \n11:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(I mean plugin/application snapshots)  \n11:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: do you know why https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/tree/stable-3.0.x has only commons-core?  \n11:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No  \n11:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Checking  \n11:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hm, I think I combined the three repos (commons-pom, commons-tools, commons-core) only on master  \n11:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since 3.0 was supposed to be stable  \n11:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So no more updates to pom or tools were needed  \n11:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Two solutions:  \n11:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see, then we can fix the versions  \n11:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a01.

 \n17:25\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0I need a review of it so that I can continue without any hesitate  \n17:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe the simpliest is patch GSON I'm not sure since it does not sounds difficult to support getters/setters but with android I'm not sure  \n17:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no \u00a0sorry did not had time to test it yet  \n17:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you should not wait for a review IMO  \n17:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0is there something blocking you ?

 \n17:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I ddon't really understand what doPageSearch() is returning  \n17:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0isn't it supposed to search pages ?  \n17:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or do you just return the first page found ?  \n17:34\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0ah for now it's only a string  \n17:34\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0but I planned to make an array of Page objects  \n17:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ho you return the JSON directly for now that's it ?  \n17:35\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0yeah  \n17:36\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0entire JSON object sent by xwiki  \n17:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and later \u00a0it will return directly list of model object right ?  \n17:37\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0yeah  \n17:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n17:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why don't doPageSearch get the keyword as parameter ?  \n17:37\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0if you check Request.java you can see decodeSearchResult() which will be moved to Search.java with Page object creation  \n17:38\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0I used setKeyword method  \n17:38\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0is it a bad practice?  \n17:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes but why ?  \n17:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it seems more complex to use  \n17:39\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0ok then I'll change it  \n17:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not bad or good practice, it depends on you reason  \n17:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I can think of some that would make it valid but not with just what it's doing right now  \n17:40\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0again I should add scope of the search to that method too  \n17:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all you do on android is expensive so if you don't have to create a Search object everytime you search something is better since it cost a new less  \n17:41\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0yeah agree with you with that Search object creation  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi I'm working on fixing this flickering test: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/749/testReport/org.xwiki.test.ui/CreatePageTest/testCreatePageFromTemplate/?auto\\_refresh=false  \n17:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0note that i'm pretty new to android development so I don't really know all good practice, just thinking like a C++ video game developer when I was young ;)  \n17:44\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0android development is nothing more than java programming  \n17:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not the same constraint  \n17:45\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0with using lowest h/w and s/w consumption  \n17:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you have very strong memory and proc constraints so you need to be carefull with that  \n17:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hiich is not the first priority generally in standard java dev  \n17:51\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0tmortagne: so what about other things in source?  \n17:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i'm looking  \n17:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think the  \n17:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\"http://\" + domain + \":\" + port  \n17:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0should be completly configurable, i.e. the user should not provide domain and port but the whole URL prefix, since you can't think or every possible URLs prefixes  \n17:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0could be for example https://something:8080/xwikiinasuburl/xwiki/rest/...  \n17:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0IMO it's simplier to let the user provide the whole https://something:8080/xwikiinasuburl/ part  \n17:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since we don't really use host and port any other way  \n17:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and even if we did we could always get it from the URL  \n17:57\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0ok  \n17:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you will also need to ask for credentials to the user since a wiki is not always public  \n17:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but i guess that was planned  \n17:58\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0u mean authentication?  \n17:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes, credentials for \u00a0authentication  \n17:58\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0I will look at it later in the project  \n17:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep you will need it mostly when you start implementing edition  \n17:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since that is pretty much never allowed to gues  \n17:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0guest  \n18:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0btw you can probably put all the http/rest plumbing in some abstract class since that will be pretty much the same thing all the time  \n18:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I will not comment on the UI part, you probably know more than me  \n18:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0for the rest anyway you will refactor when more use case comes anyway so no need to comment right now  \n18:03\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0sry I didn't the point about that abstract class?  \n18:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0most of Search#doPageSearch() code will be the exact same code for pretty much all rest related requets (getPage, getObject, etc...) so you should put all that with parameters in an AbstractRestRequest or something like that  \n18:06\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0yeah yeah now i got it :)  \n18:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyway just commenting what I think of I'm sure you wold have done it when adding another request that Search  \n18:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/that/than/  \n18:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I think that's pretty much all for now, unless you have specific question ?
