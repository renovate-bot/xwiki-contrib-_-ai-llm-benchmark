I personally don't like answering to people who hide their names. Why would I help them when they make life more complex for me by removing all context information  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I knew it were you, I'd have answered differentlt because we've already discussed in the past  \n10:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I know your knwoledge, what you don't know already, etc  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and keeping a map of aliases in my small head is hard\u2026  \n10:57\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And?

It won't lead to too much business code in wiki pages instead of having Script services for that? Also maybe we should raise an issue on the velocity side about it?  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe they had a reason and if not they should be ok to implement it I guess  \n11:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would not make much sens as script service, only Velocity have these limitations  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not about veloicity nor limitation  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's about offereing a higher level api to do whatever is needed  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Class already have theses method, all other script langues can use it, only Velocity cannot  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the more power we give to veloicity the more people will use it to code business logic  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no need to invent new APIs  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and that's why velocity is nicer than groovy and other scripting languages  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because you can do less  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree it's more a question of best practices  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those limitation are useless, they don't cause any security issue  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'm more worried that if you introduce them it means you're going to use them :)  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes that's the plan  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'm curious to see the use case  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like we use automatic parameters convertions  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0conversion is not business logic  \n11:05\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not saying they're bad, I don't know, I guess it'll depend on the use cases  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's a use case  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for displaying stuff  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should be ok I guess  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in anyc ase don't you think  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that the velocity project should do this change too?  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we often need to check if an object implement some class, right now we are doing hack with class name but if it's a extends it does not work  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes IMO they should do that change (or most probably add configuration for methods like there is for packages and class names)  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I just added a few useful methods here, did not really reviewed all Class methods to analyze we one to enable  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/we/which/  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: just commented at https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/cec4ea36061bdc186838a0034806fd98a218c203#commitcomment-5060660  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just added one more comment  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it could have been ok in 6.0 but I'm close to -1 for (.4  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a05.4  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0waiting for other's opinions  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea, Denis, lucaa, others: any opinion?  \n11:22\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: lemme read  \n11:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol, tmortagne: what will be the usage of those methods ?  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: (11:06:45 AM) tmortagne: we often need to check if an object implement some class, right now we are doing hack with class name but if it's a extends it does not work  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm actually I may be wrong, you've changed a default right?  \n11:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yep, but where do expect to use it now ?  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if users haven't uncommented the property they don't need to update their xwiki.properties  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0things like isEnum/isPrimitive/etc are also useful for me to simplify a bit wikistream UI  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: the property is commented so yes https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/cec4ea36061bdc186838a0034806fd98a218c203 does not change anything, like I said in the comment it's just documentation  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0my issue was more about the upgrade issue but if it's a property that is usually uncommented it's less of an issue  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's still an issue  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becuase on severla instances, we uncomment this property  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order to remove the deprecated uberspector  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's actually a production recommendation  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to avoid filling the logs  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I know GF is doing it too on production instances  \n11:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0right, but according to the fact that we have no intends to use this in many places, only wiki streams, it reduce the impact IMO  \n11:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO we should introduce an enable/disable switch for the deprecated uberspector, it's simpler modifying this property is dangerous  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki stream is used everywhere Denis  \n11:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the UI ?  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0import, export, etc  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: it's not only about wikistream, like I said we have various hacks based on the class name instead of proper instanceof-like check  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and for example I will need for displaying the log tree  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys I'm going to try upgrading jenkins to 1.547 which supposedly fixed the issue we had in 546  \n11:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0anyway, the migration recommandation which are as valuable as the production recommandation says that you have to merge your configuration files, so, is this recommandation not valid for stabilisation releases ?  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again it's all useful methods with no security concern, there was no reason for them to be disabled by default and I don't even see why we are arguing about the most standard methods in Java...  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: it's about making it easy for users  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and most of them don't read RN or not to that extent and they'd need to read ALL RN)  \n11:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0users uncommenting that config line are already somehow advanced users  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we can make it easier for users we should IMO  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because I know for sure a big majority (of those who uncommtned this line) will have failures because of this  \n11:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I would have agreed with you if it was uncommented by default  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0including xwiki sas platform guys ;)  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: org.xwiki.velocity.introspection.MethodArgumentsUberspector is not very old and I don't remember any upgrade complain about it  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is the converter for method param?  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and the reason we did'nt get complain I think  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is because we started removing the deprecatdd upberspector in production only after  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe xwiki sas is currently the only one doing this :)  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case, I don't want to veto it so I'll go with the flow but for sure it needs to be added in the upgrade section  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(of the RN)  \n11:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: I don't have a strong opinion, in general when I upgrade things I check the differences in xwiki.properties for this very reason. If it cannot have side effects, as in things that used to mean something will now mean something else because some new functions were \"enabled\", then I don't necessarrily -1 it  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: yes I'd have agreed too if it were not the last release of the 5.x cycle but ok, I may be too protective but that's a good thing too since we need to be careful, so it allows us to discuss it and at least now you're all aware of this potential issue ;)  \n11:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0(12:33:47 PM) vmassol: is because we started removing the deprecatdd upberspector in production only after  \n11:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0Deprecated warnings can be muted? And you tell me that just now?  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: :)  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's even a FAQ  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/How+to+avoid+deprecated+messages+in+the+logs  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW tmortagne this FAQ will need to be updated too I guess  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and all places on xwiki.org mentioning the old uberspector  \n11:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0./start\\_xwiki.sh --I-like-it-when-things-fail-during-upgrade-mute-deprecation-warnings  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt much places mention \"org.apache.velocity.util.introspection.SecureUberspector\"  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not probably not a lot  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know one (the FAQ) maybe there are others  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they probably talk about the secure uberspector in general  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe in the velocity module doc  \n11:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0actually on the topic of deprecation, I think we ought to consider \\*removing\\* some of the deprecation tags on methods since we have zillions of deprecated methods which are still used more or less constantly and we have no plan to remove them  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the FAQ should probably indicate to remove the DeprecatedCheckUberspector instead  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it needs an example  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's much simpler for the user  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: :)  \n11:44\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0cjd: ./start\\_xwiki.sh --OK,-come-on-my-wiki-and-refactor-all-code-to-not-use-$msg.get-anymore  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0removing deprecation is not a good idea IMO when we wish to go the other way  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no code in XE that uses $msg  \n11:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hehe  \n11:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0maybe msg.get should be targetted for undeprecation :D  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's an unclosed discussison about this one  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to make it simpler to add translations  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$services.localization.render(\u2026) is a bit cumbersome  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it was raised by Edy  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we didn't finish the discussion  \n11:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0$services was a bad choice of name because it makes everything long  \n11:46\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: I think you're sliding away from the main topic  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I am  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not my fault  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd pushed me!  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0brainhacking vulnerability  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0next step is brain inception ;)  \n11:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0so, so vmassol: i don't want the xcommons issue merged in 5.4. I'm just saying that, as part of my xwikisas job of preparing upgrades, I always check config files changes and prepare a 3 way merge if needed.

I'd like it to just work (tm).  \n17:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0+1 that  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK tomcat will use that name as the servlet context by default  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless you also provide a tomcat xml config file for it I believe  \n17:31\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: xwiki?  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the name of the WAR  \n17:31\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: so if I deploy the WAR as xwiki.war it should just use that?  \n17:32\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: because I can do that pretty easily.  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0herlo: tomcat loads everything it find, including WAR so from it's point of view you have several apps here  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: not quite  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the directory and the WAR have the same prefix name it's only deployed once  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(AFAIK)  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I may be wrong though  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not seems to be the case here  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case be on the safe side for sure  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since the error definitely means thet you have several XWiki  \n17:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0herlo's stack trace indicates otherwis  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it auto unacks it by itself  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5213699/why-is-my-war-file-automatically-exploded-in-tomcat  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0herlo: if you want to write a rpm you could look at what the official deb package does  \n17:34\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: hmm...  \n17:34\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: do you know where that might reside? I'm sure i could hunt it down if necessary...  \n17:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: using xwiki from a war file is not that easy due to the config files, so we should not advice to do so  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't know much about rpm but maybe there is stuff to reuse some way  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/tree/master/xwiki-enterprise-installers/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian  \n17:34\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0specifically, the dsc source  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: we don't advise to do that at all!!!!!  \n17:35\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks! I'm sure it'll be helpful.  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(check the doc)  \n17:35\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0so there's a better recommendation over the war file?  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that it's not exactly a standard deb source, it's built using a maven plugin but you will find the standard scripts here and there and the location of the files are in the pom.xml  \n17:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: hides documents in far corners of xwiki.org so he can say \"it's well documented\" xD  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: \u00a0vmassol helps in documenting xwiki unlike some others\u2026. :)  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0herlo: downloading the deb package themself and openning them with some archive manager might be easier to read actually  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/  \n17:37\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: right, which is why I asked for a link to the sources.  \n17:37\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: oh, there's one there?  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's all the xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-\\* packages  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/tree/master/xwiki-enterprise-installers/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian are the sources  \n17:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0in regards to your specific question about .war files, what is usually done is to grab the .war file and then unpack it manually and then use just the resulting directory..  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki.org would need a lot more love from us all  \n17:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0xwiki.org has a lot of information but it's all kind of hidden  \n17:38\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0cjd: hmm, okay  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0herlo: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationTomcat  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/ are actual \\*.deb files so not really what I call sources :)  \n17:38\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: yeah, been reading that  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here's the hidden place as cjd calls it  \n17:39\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: it's pretty vague, however. I'm clearly not a java person.  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let us know what is vague so that it can be fixed or better yet, update it yourself too once you know how to do it  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what's vague?  \n17:39\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0So things like how maven works are kind of a mystery to me. Unless I spend a whole day reading up on it and understanding it, but I try to avoid java as much as possible.  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maven?  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the relationship with tomcat?  \n17:40\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: well, there's some deployment stuff in the debian packages that uses maven  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the link I gave you is to install xwiki in tomcat nothinh else  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's another topic  \n17:40\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: right, but I didn't know how a war file worked. It seems illogical to me that it would expand the file and then have a conflict.  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0herlo: well xwiki cannot document all servelt containers  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0obviously each servlet container has its own doc  \n17:40\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: I didn't expect it would. :)  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and BTW I'm still not sure it causes a conflict  \n17:41\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: I'm just pointing out my own ignorance  \n17:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0herlo: based on your thinking, you might prefer to just use the .zip file and run start\\_xwiki.sh, this way you can skip tomcat/apache \"mess\". I would still recommend switching the db to mysql  \n17:41\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: yeah, I'm testing.  \n17:41\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0cjd: nope. I'd prefer to use proper redhat service management  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be strange that tomcat caused a conflict since it's tomct that does the unpacking  \n17:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n17:41\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: I agree.  \n17:42\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0cjd: and overall, I think I may have discovered my issue, thanks to you nice folks.  \n17:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Some people \"just want something that works\" and a ./start\\_xwiki.sh and you're done is a godsent  \n17:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but no management ofc :)  \n17:42\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0cjd: yeah, my goal is to make the xwiki rpm that just works (tm)  \n17:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0cool  \n17:43\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0and a small README document about configuring database, tomcat, etc. into the rpm as well.  \n17:43\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0cjd: if I get it working right, it'll end up in EPEL and fedora proper.  \n17:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0awesome  \n17:43\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0which could lead to more adoptoin.  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nice  \n17:43\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0adoption, even.  \n17:44\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0And since I'll be maintaining xwiki for the Code Aurora Forum for years, I'm sure it'll come in handy to me that way.  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very nice  \n17:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you should probably just unpack it and delete the original .war file instead  \n17:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that way you can then edit the hibernate.cfg.xml file automatically if you so choose  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0herlo: don't keep it as a war as otherwise you can't change xwiki configuration which is part of the war  \n17:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0anyway people always want to tinker with the cfg files  \n17:46\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: when I redeployed the war, it seemed to keep the configs. Is this not the case?  \n17:46\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: do you recommend an alternate way?  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0herlo: look at the deb package, really  \n17:47\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: I will. :)  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's for debian but should not be very different in Fedora  \n17:47\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: the problem I have is I'm not so comfortable with maven, which is what it looks like it uses to deploy.  \n17:47\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0at least from the links you provided  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0let me list you the major deb packages:  \n17:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-common/5.4-milestone-1/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-common-5.4-milestone-1.deb for XWiki itself without db and app server setup  \n17:49\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: yeah, I think I'm looking at this one: http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-tomcat6-mysql/5.3/  \n17:50\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: thing is, I don't see the dsc  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-tomcat-common/5.4-milestone-1/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-tomcat-common-5.4-milestone-1.deb for some stuff commons to all tomcat versions  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no idea what a dsc is  \n17:50\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0debian source code  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't need it  \n17:50\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0it's similar to a srpm  \n17:51\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0well, if I want to read how they built the deb file, I do  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just open the deb package with any archive manager  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you will see the files in it  \n17:51\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0I did, it has more tarballs  \n17:51\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0ahh, found it in there  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no dsc here since we build it with a maven plugin  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we are not using debian builder  \n17:52\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0right, I see  \n17:52\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: that was probably what was confusing me  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-tomcat7-mysql/5.4-milestone-1/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian-tomcat7-mysql-5.4-milestone-1.deb for things specific to tomcat 7 version  \n17:53\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: cool, thanks  \n17:57\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: cjd: vmassol: what are your normal office hours?  \n17:57\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0I figure I'll be back here asking more questions at some point and thought I'd try to accommodate you.  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0around 9:00-7:00 GMT+1 for me  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0more or less the same for me and probably not far for cjd either  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'm often connected more\u2026 ;)  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm a newbie regarding deb or linux package managers though!  \n17:59\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0so you'll be around for another 4-5ish hours normally  \n17:59\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0vmassol: that's fine, I'm going to need more assistance with the java side of things.  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope, in 1 hour it'll be 7 here  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok good  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:59\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0I'm UTC-7  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahaha  \n18:00\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0lol  \n18:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hehe  \n18:00\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0lol @ xwikibot  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah it's misbehaving sometimes  \n18:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0herlo: I wrote teh debian package but I'm far from being an expert debian adminsys so there might be some things that are not perfect or non so standard in there  \n18:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0my understanding is debian packaging is significantly harder than redhat  \n18:01\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0tmortagne: well, as long as I can ask you guys how you think it \\*should\\* look, I can work with it. :)  \n18:01\u00a0<herlo>\u00a0I'll get there.
