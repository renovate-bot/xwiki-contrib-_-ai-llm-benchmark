(possibly the one that normal xwiki uses)  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: hmm I don't know but probably not  \n09:41\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hehe, that's not too good :) i use sso authenticator which effectively breaks the rest authentication :) (you can't have multiple authentication headers and there is no cookie)  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one more thing to improve :)  \n09:45\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:50\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, but there is XWikiUser xwikiUser = xwiki.getAuthService().checkAuth(xwikiContext); in rest server internals  \n09:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0pretty sure REST service is reusing configured authenticator but maybe there is some issues on the REST related specifics  \n10:05\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, it looks like it's working (apparently tomcat filters work differently for local addresses)  \n10:07\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n10:08\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol, tmortagne: check my last mail on devs when you have some time, thanks :)  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: yep currently reading it  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0will do  \n10:54\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:28\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0vmassol: is that ok? ^  \n11:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: yes thanks  \n11:41\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0you're welcome  \n11:41\u00a0<drbignik>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<kanedafromparis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: replying now  \n12:25\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:47\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:09\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n13:23\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0question about contrib: Once a user gets a repository and gets commit rights, does he get rights only on that repository, or does he get rights on all the repos under the xwiki-contrib organization?  \n13:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0from what I can see it`s the latter and, IMO, that`s kind of broken.  \n13:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: ?  \n13:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yes, the latter  \n13:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0well that`s broken  \n13:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0it's broken from a quality point of view  \n13:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0a newbee user just requested a repo on contrib and he was granted access to \\*all\\* repos  \n13:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's the svn model, anyone can jump in on any project, otherwise you'd keep the project in your personal repo  \n13:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0then, the next thing he did was to approve a pull request on some other repository where he magically got access  \n13:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0no, that`s broken  \n13:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this makes pull requests = 0  \n13:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if anyone can circumvent it  \n13:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you escaladare rights by asking for a bogus project  \n13:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and then you start directly committing on the project you are really interested in  \n13:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we need to fix this  \n13:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if you feel that the svn model is broken or not fit for xwiki contributions, I agree, but not because I think people are evil and will slip sneeky code into other projects  \n13:29\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0actually I don't like the realtime-wysiwyg \u2026 I think I should remove some pages :)  \n13:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0git remote set-url origin [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):cjdeisle/... :)  \n13:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0git push  \n13:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I was talking about the whole logic behind pull requests  \n13:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I need a command line script for making new repos on github, I can do everything else from the comfy shell  \n13:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this setup we have completely defeats its purpose  \n13:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0it's nice to have this kind of rights when everybody is trust worthy .. but on contrib we create repos without any questions...  \n13:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think from a risk PoV it's no problem because there just isn't anything worth enough to attack  \n13:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0how about quality?  \n13:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but once a person transfers their project over to a forge, they nolonger own it and so it gets abandoned  \n13:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0everything in my personal repo is (should be) maintained or die(s)  \n13:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0all the high quality applicaitons on e.x.o are on contrib  \n13:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0aka is maintained or deleted  \n13:33\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0cjd, not worth attacking? There are apps that get on e.x.o and then into enterprises' wikis. Might want to rethink that statement.  \n13:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mhm, they're all developed by XWiki SAS which has a company policy to use that repo  \n13:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0contrib is not for XWiki SAS (there are others too that have access there)  \n13:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mm I was just about to say \"bring it up on the list\" but actually \\*that\\* is a broken system so good luck getting consensus on anything there :)  \n13:37\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n13:38\u00a0<ppantiru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thinking more about it, I kind of understand the reasons why it's like that. The xwiki-contrib org is more of a free-for-all area, as opposed to the xwiki org (where only approved committers do stuff).  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0basically if any problematic user on contrib stands out, he can easily get his rights revoked or only restricted to his project  \n13:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the best practice is to use pull requests is it's not your project and you are a newbee  \n13:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0or if you just need validation for your change  \n13:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if you`re 100% sure about it, go ahead and push, even in other repos  \n13:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: I don't think the current xwiki-contrib model is broken, sure people can do crap but on active project other people will revert  \n13:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's pretty much like saying that wiki model is broken  \n13:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: the whole spark was the pull request mechanism, for which you don`t have an analogy with the wiki model  \n13:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0though, as mentioned, pull requests on contrib have more of a consultative nature when compared to pull requests on xwiki  \n13:58\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure it's a feature wikis (at least XWiki) don't have that's all, but it's still the same thing, what is important is that in the end the bad things are reverted (and the bad citizen get fired if needed)  \n13:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, I guess  \n14:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that right from the pull request UI you have a revert button  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure if it reopen the pull request but at least it revert the changes  \n14:02\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0part of the cleverness of the wiki model is to give more power but with the ability to revert, that way people get things done instead of endlessly scheduling meetings to get someone with the right security clearence  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I also disagree with you  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not broken and it was done like this voluntarily  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's very good that someone was able to accept a PR on another project  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now if the PR wasn't good we just need to tell that to whoever accepted it and dsicuss with him/her  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we wanted is to encourage cross-project contributions  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're not a lot already and putting barriers would just be plain stupid  \n14:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0how many were there?  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of what?  \n14:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0cross-project contributions  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't know, hundreds  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hard to know since we don't really know who is from which project  \n14:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0[citation needed]  \n14:04\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0;)  \n14:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how many problemes were there?  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how long did it take you to handle credentials?  \n14:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh 0 security problems, I never suggested there was a security issue :)  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how many lists do we have?  \n14:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0talk to Enygma` about that  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0etc  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seen our current # of issues we got and the size of our community  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is about 1-3 persons per contrib project  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be bad to create silos  \n14:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mmm businesses don't like code ownership because they like to imagine all employees as replacable fireable assets  \n14:06\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think  \n14:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but code ownership is popular in github  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"[citation needed]\": you could do some stats on how many people contributed to more than 1 project  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: if you want code ownership  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't give your repo to the xwiki-contrib org!!!  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's exactly the opposite  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the goal is to not have ownership  \n14:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0/nod  \n14:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't provide git hosting, github do it already, the point of contrib is to put the project in a community were more people that know about XWiki have the right to participate to the project  \n14:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Indeed, I did clarify this above. Thanks and sorry for the noise.  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no it's interesting to discuss and that we garee :)  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*agree  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/no/np  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0probably mean it's not clear enough on http://contrib.xwiki.org  \n14:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(even if it does seems to be explained)  \n14:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I still don`t think the whole \"donation of code\" thing is explained well enough on the contrib.xwiki.org  \n14:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it is implied though...  \n14:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but as Vincent mentioned, we did not really hear that many complaints  \n14:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the first sentence which is \"The XWiki Contrib Project provides hosting for projects related to XWiki.\" is probably a bit misleading (yes most people only read that :))  \n14:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: WDYT of \"XWiki Contrib is a community dedicated to collaborative development of XWiki related projects and extensions in the spirit of wiki communities.\" to replace the first sentence ?  \n14:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: sounds good to me, at least we remove the \"hoting\" part  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and I find it a bit more sexy that a simple hosting :)  \n14:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0should we or should we not drop the word \"forge\" in there?  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: don't know, the definition of a forge to me is not much more that \"a bunch of projects\"  \n15:05\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n15:44\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:46\u00a0<ppantiru>\u00a0has quit  \n15:59\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n16:03\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:12\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:23\u00a0<kanedafromparis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:29\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0is now known as <Enygma`>  \n17:22\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:33\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:39\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:48\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:15\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0Hi  \n18:35\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<Pbas1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:57\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:59\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:11\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n22:27\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:23\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
