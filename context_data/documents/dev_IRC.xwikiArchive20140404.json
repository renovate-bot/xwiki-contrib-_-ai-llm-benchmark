I tried a few things but can only get \"XWiki.Admin\".  \n10:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: what version of XWiki ? In recent version you have $xwiki.getUserReference() which gived you a complete DocumentReference  \n10:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like I forgot to indicate the @since in the javadoc  \n10:12\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a05.4.1  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually I'm not the one who added it :)  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in 5.4.1 you should have it  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then you can use model script service to serialize it as you want (by default you will get a complete reference with toString() I think)  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model+Module#HScriptServiceAPI  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this API exist since 3.2 actually, i'm mising with something else I added recently  \n10:15\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: Hmmm, $xwiki.getUserReference() called from velocity does not return anything. My workaround was just prefixing the string with \"xwiki:\", but that seemed a little odd ^\\_^  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not $xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0$xcontext  \n10:16\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0ahhh :) great thx  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0di not know you could get the context user from $xwiki acually  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not sounds like the right place  \n10:16\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0You get the wrapper object :)  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but still  \n10:17\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Hmmm, the class docs at http://maven.xwiki.org/site/xwiki-core-parent/xwiki-core/apidocs/com/xpn/xwiki/api/Context.html seem to be a little out-dated :)  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't use http://maven.xwiki.org/site  \n10:17\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0:)  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/SRD/Navigation?xpage=embed is better  \n10:18\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Google pointed me there  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we should clean that old maven site generation try  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looking at it  \n10:18\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: thx again :)  \n10:19\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0bookmarked ^\\_\u00b0  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: you're welcome  \n10:51\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0How do i get rid of a paragraph with a br at the beginning of #xwikicontent? I tried removing some blank lines, but then I get a \"When using the HTML macro inline, you can only use inline HTML content. Block HTML content (such as tables) cannot be displayed\" error :/  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0spu7nic: what's not clear in this message? (trying to find out how to improve it if it's not clear)  \n10:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: put wiki=\"false\" in your {{velocity}} macro to debug what your script actually generate so see where exactly this <br/> come from  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(velocity or other script macro)  \n10:53\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0velocity  \n10:54\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: I know where the paragraph comes from - but I can't add an html macro with clean=\"true\" at the beginning of my velocity block :(  \n10:55\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0and clean=\"false\" removes all the panels  \n10:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: the issue does not come from your html macro  \n10:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's inline when remove the empty line before it then it means there is something before that html macro  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you should see it quickly with wiki=\"false\"  \n10:58\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Indeed, another velocity block with output=\"none\" :)  \n10:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you have just one empty line between your velocity output=false and the following one there is no reason you get a <br/>  \n10:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you probably have too much of those  \n11:02\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/TtmmJLcm  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: if the velocity macro that contain your html macro is not standalone it's content is not standalone either  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0put an empty line between the two first velocity macros  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in general unless you specifically want a macro to be in a <p> always isolate macros  \n11:04\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0Ahhh  \n11:04\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0That was the only thing I didn't try :/  \n11:04\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0It never even came to my mind that there had to be a newline between two velocity blocks ^\\_\u00b0  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the logic is that when you visually have two element in the same logical paragraph then they become inline element in the same paragraph, whatever element it is  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/element/elements/  \n11:05\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: thx ;)  \n11:06\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0My thought was: output=\"none\" means, there it will be no conent  \n11:06\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0content  \n11:06\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0And I can ignore the first block  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and there will be no content in html, but paragraphs are calculated before executing the macros  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and macros are black box  \n11:07\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: I should definitely send you a bottle of wine some day :D  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: please don't bother, I don't drink wine (yea OK I'm French and don't drink wine but I do eat a lot of cheese so it's Ok ;))  \n11:28\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:34\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0what would be the best way to redirect a user to a specific page after a page has been saved with save & view?  \n13:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spu7nic: how does the user access to that edit mode ? you can put ?xredirect=urltoredirectto in the edit URL and the redirect will be applied after the save  \n13:36\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0tmortagne: perfect - that will work :)  \n13:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that xredirect thing works with most actions  \n13:38\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0does xredirect allow Spacename.Pagename or do you have to specify the escaped URL?  \n13:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a URL  \n13:39\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0ah, thx :)  \n13:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but indeed supporting any reference would be nice  \n13:39\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0+1 :)  \n13:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that I don't thing the URL need to be complete  \n13:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think you can put relative URL  \n13:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/thing/think/  \n13:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since redirect to relative URL works  \n13:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(not at HTTP level but at app server level)  \n13:46\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n13:51\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:55\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:56\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:57\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:10\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:43\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:59\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0has quit  \n15:30\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n15:30\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:30\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n15:31\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:46\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:56\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n15:56\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:10\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n16:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:27\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:55\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:31\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:50\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n18:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:27\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:09\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0has quit  \n20:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:44\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:46\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:10\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
