I'm asking since I know lots of projects in prodcution that are using it  \n13:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know there's an existing issue about it but it seems to be a small since all those projects are using it in production. WDYT?  \n13:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0no problem with using it default IMO  \n13:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0there is the issue of deleted attachments not showing up in the tab  \n13:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and if we make it default, we should remove the deleted attachments tab at the same time  \n13:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0as far as stability and stuff, it all seems to be fine  \n13:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0kind of off-topic, deleting a document with FS attachments does the wrong thing because oldcore does an XML export of the document (with versions and attachments) and stuffs \\*that\\* into the database :(  \n13:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0\"wrong thing\" --> uses a ton of memory anyway  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k I'll try to move forward with FS as default for attachments, will check past emails on the topic and resend something if need be  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n14:03\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:04\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0cjd: do you have an idea about http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11159 ?
