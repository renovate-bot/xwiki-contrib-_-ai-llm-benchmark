I've come as across some Wikis that offer no access control.  \n23:11\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0sdumitriu: Would you know how this access control is managed at the back end? For example, is it done in a Java class? If so, where can I find it.  \n23:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0That's a lot of code actually  \n23:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Several Java classes, manipulating data stored in the database  \n23:13\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0What exactly do you want to know?  \n23:13\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0So it is done at the database layer, instead of the application layer?  \n23:13\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0What?  \n23:13\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:14\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0I am a student at the University of Calgary, my supervisor and I are working on an Access Control system.  \n23:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0OK, I think I know what you're asking  \n23:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Access rights are stored as metadata (structured objects) attached to documents in the wiki  \n23:14\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0I am trying to find out how difficult would it be to change the access control mechanism in XWiki  \n23:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0XWiki has support for structured data, not just unstructured text  \n23:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So there are XWiki.XWikiRights objects, with properties for \"list of users\", \"list of groups\", \"list of access rights\", and \"allow or deny\"  \n23:15\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0This is seeming a bit like TWiki.  \n23:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Several such objects are stored in the database  \n23:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, XWiki is derived from TWiki  \n23:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, it did a long time ago, in 2003  \n23:15\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0Oh okay, I am familiar with TWiki.  \n23:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0They're so far away now, I don't know what's left in common except the structured data principle  \n23:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It shouldn't be too difficult now, since it has recently been moved to a component  \n23:16\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0So there are a few interfaces to implement  \n23:17\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0Ok. One of the reasons I'm trying to switch from TWiki is because I'm not very familiar with Perl.  \n23:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0I'll give you a link soon, a bit busy  \n23:17\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n23:17\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan`>  \n23:17\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0Thank you,  \n23:18\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0\u00a0I have to head out too, I'll check out the source code a bit, and then return.  \n23:19\u00a0<szrrizvi>\u00a0has quit\n"}
