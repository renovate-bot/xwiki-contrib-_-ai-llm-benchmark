I'm trying to solve a issue on XWord..   \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:32): |this|is|a|table - right? a simple one... but a paragraph means a new line.. so is it possible to create paragraphs using XWiki syntax?  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:33): are you talking about XOFFICE-68?  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:34): yes  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:34): you don't work directly with wiki syntax in XWord  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:34): the first solution that came in my mind was to replace \"<td.\\*>\\\\s\\*<p  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:35): with <td.\\*> .. and then \"</p>\\\\s\\*</td>\" with \"</td>\"   \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:35): i preffer to have most filtering at DOM level  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:35): I understand  \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 17:36): Regular expressions are not a good approach here  \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 17:36): Imagine <td><p>first</p><p>second</p></td>  \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 17:36): You'll get a badly broken result  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:36): yes.. you are right..  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:37): So the the only string filters/transformations are applied just to prepare the ugly html source for DOM loading  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:37): but, also your example is a good example in which we don't actually need to make the paragraphs to dissapear  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:37): we just need to convert them to the correct xwiki syntax  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:38): so.. any idea about a paragraph in a table cell (<p> in <td>)?  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:40): vmassol: how does the renderer handle paragraphs inside table cells?  \nvmassol - (31/03/2009 17:41): florinciu: we have a known issue here: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-3262  \nvmassol - (31/03/2009 17:41): don't know if that's your use case or not  \nvmassol - (31/03/2009 17:42): I'm starting working on it   \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 17:42): To all GSoC students: Don't wait until the last moment to submit your propsal. You should try to submit an initial version at least by tomorrow night. This way we can give you feedback before it is too late.  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:44): florinciu: it looks like the XOFFICE-68 depends on XWIKI-3262 ... perhaps i should leave it for now..  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:44): yes  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:46): this completly breaks tables on XWord. Users will have to save pages as xhtml until this is fixed. It's a pity, xwiki 2.0 syntax is so cool.  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:51): florinciu: what about XOFFICE-62? the regexp approach is ok?  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:55): i'm not very good at regexp. And I prefer not to have criptic elements in the code. This is what is suggest:  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:56): 1) Search for a automatic solution in System.xml namespace. Especially in XmlDocument or XmlWriter  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 17:58): 2) If you don't find a resonable solution then you do string processing after getting the DOM output. I'll review your path and if regexp is the best solution, i'll apply it.  \ntachirei - (31/03/2009 17:58): ok. thanks  \nancutagheorghe - (31/03/2009 18:09): hello, regarding to the \"Create a new Student Proposal\" form .. can anyone tell please me what i am expected to write in the Abstract field?   \ntudor\\_f - (31/03/2009 19:18): hello everybody  \ntudor\\_f - (31/03/2009 19:19): i am interested in the gsoc project concerning cross platform widgets/desktop widgets  \ntudor\\_f - (31/03/2009 19:21): and just the remove a possible question mark.. first of all it's about developing a common backend datasource for all widgets, than sequentally implementing the widgets listed on the project reference page..right?  \ntudor\\_f - (31/03/2009 19:26): so, am i getting the right idea?  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 19:37): hi tudor\\_f  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 19:37): that datasource is the platform(REST API + RSS)  \nflorinciu - (31/03/2009 19:39): i don't think there's needed any adtional server coding for the widgets. sdumitriu should know more about that.  \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 19:40): I was offline, can you paste the relevant part?  \ntudor\\_f - (31/03/2009 19:40): yeah, that much i figured out myself, but what i'm not sure about it's the fact if the project implies building the widgets one by one or just the service platform behind them  \ntudor\\_f - (31/03/2009 19:40): sure  \ntudor\\_f - (31/03/2009 19:41): tudor\\_f: and just to remove a possible question mark.. first of all it's about developing a common backend datasource for all widgets, than sequentally implementing the widgets listed on the project reference page..right?  \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 19:41): Indeed, there's no need for any other data source  \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 19:41): The REST API should be used  \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 19:42): If there's something missing, you can propose to extend the REST API  \ntudor\\_f - (31/03/2009 19:43): i see, so it's about providing a uniform rss/REST interface for all widget platforms  \nsdumitriu - (31/03/2009 19:44): tudor\\_f: What project are you talking about?
