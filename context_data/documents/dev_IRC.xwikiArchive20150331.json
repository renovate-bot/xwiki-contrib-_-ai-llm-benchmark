Note that we have something similar already with the Git Extension  \n14:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what DarkKnightCZ suggested sounds like something you could do  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's not a push but it's a pull though)  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XWiki+Application+-+GitHub+App  \n14:03\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: would that be automatic though?  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/git/github  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a bidirectional bridge  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt it's automatic in the github app  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0probably something you ask  \n14:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you could put that in a scheduler  \n14:05\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0or create scripted document and add it as a hook (it will be automatically loaded when you push something)  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or that yes, some document to execute when a push is done  \n14:16\u00a0<John>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:16\u00a0<John>\u00a0is now known as <Guest52113>  \n14:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: ok, so you would \"pull\" the github changes within the script (document) triggered by a push?  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Trefex: my goal of some time back was to implement an XWiki store using Git  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(i.e. no sync)  \n14:27\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so xwiki would directly sit on git, similar to gollum? vmassol  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I haven't done it yet and one preliminary need \u00a0is to refactor our store API to extract the search\\*() methods out and have some other code handle that (like SOLR)  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case it's a lot of work  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but if we wish to support various backends we would need to do that  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(various = nosql backends for example, git, etc)  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or keep the search\\*() methods but implement them using SOLR for git  \n14:28\u00a0<Guest52113>\u00a0has quit  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(probably more realistic)  \n14:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Trefex: I wrote a tool for building and importing/exporting xwiki documents but it's undocumented at the moment  \n14:29\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0two more qurstions. 1. Does the WYSIWYG editor support Google Open fonts? and 2. Is there support for drag&drop of images?  \n14:30\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: i see, well a sync is not so much an issue, if it could be done automatically, but then pushing changes back to git could be an issue, i see....  \n14:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0my tool is something like... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0dumpdocument http://yourwiki/xwiki/Whatever/Document  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well both use cases are useful  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're different  \n14:31\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0cjd: i see, what does it do?
