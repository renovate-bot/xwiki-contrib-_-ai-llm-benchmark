There are two problems I could reproduce: (1) document translation bundle is not registered after upgrade in workspaces and (2) there is a merge problem with the workspace home page title  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: look pretty serious no?  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you can reproduce then it should be relatively easy to fix  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'd say you should spend the day with thomas to work on them  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WDYT?  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: what's your take?  \n11:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll let thomas says if they are easy to fix or not  \n11:22\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so DW Upgrade mode has been fixed .. 1) from my e-mail  \n11:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0note that I won't be available in the next couple of days, so I can only do the release today..  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no idea if (2) would be easy to fix, need to debug it in a diff module unit test  \n11:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I can help you with that by reproducing the problem with a script  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for (1) I don't know what is the issue yet and reproduce it by doing an upgrade is not very quick  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're indeed getting very late on the release date  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: the best would be to write a diff module unit test with the stings you got  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0initially we were supposed to release on the 15th of april  \n11:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne, yes, I can do that  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're now aiming towars the 3rd of May I think  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tomorrow is bank holiday in France  \n11:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and for (1) I can give you the /data folder I got just after upgrading the mai UI but without performing the next steps  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so in total that would be 3 weeks delay, I think that the most we've ever drifted\u2026 oooops :)  \n11:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure it's good to release a final version on Friday  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: \u00a0wdym?  \n11:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I mean for advertisement  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0advertising is not a problem IMO  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is in succeeding to release something stable  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway yes if we want to fix those two issues it's going to be short to release today especially if I'm the one fixing the two issue and releasing  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: re (1) ok for the data folder if still have it  \n11:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep, I'll send it to you in private  \n11:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok thanks  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0bb in 1h  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: quick question: do you sometimes test on domain-based setups?  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(sburjan or msmeria)  \n12:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: domain based setup = vincent.xwiki.org for example ?  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just curious  \n12:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0no, I never did that. I wasn't able to setup a domain only using my local machine  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because I don't think we have many automated tets on that  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's easy  \n12:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0even in the old days when domain setup was the default, I used to switch to the other one  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just need to modify your hosts file  \n12:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I'll try that  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm so that's not very good because it means we don't know if it works or not  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be interesting to find some way to test that either automated or manual  \n12:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well, seems to be working because xwiki.org would fail otherwise  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm asking because I'm going to make some changes to the url module  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes good point, xwiki.org and myxwiki.org are good tests  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but it's still good to test that because a lot of code has been refactored in 5.0 with the move to virtual mode only  \n12:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n12:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: In your proposal avbout links, there are triple >, are those intended ?  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: ah my bad then, let me check  \n12:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:51\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ping  \n13:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:25\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Pong  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: got to go, sorry but I just wanted to ask you about the platform failure  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to commit sometihng on platform  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'm worried that problems might not been seen with the current build failure  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be great if you could either roll back or check the latest from thomasD  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks, bb in 1 hour  \n14:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:10\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back  \n14:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: an early alpha version of the DW doc is available.  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: good start!  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it might be worth explanding a bit at the end on the 2 modes (farm vs workspaces)  \n14:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thanks :) I'll ping the devs to ask for their feedback, maybe they also want to put more technical information  \n14:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Ok, I'll do that  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0needs platform/Features/WebHome as parent  \n14:54\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0now we need to find a nice icont for http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/FeaturesExtract  \n14:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0done, linked  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you release the lock?  \n15:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: done  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n15:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0now we need an better icon :P  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think I found what the issue is with translations  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when upgrading workspaces  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from what I understand the issue is that there is no translation...  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is two translation bundles in workspaces, one in xwiki-platform-workspace-ui which is installed as extension and one in xwiki-platform-workspace-template-features which is imported by workspaces when creating a wiki...  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is not much EM can do here  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we need workspaces to check all subwikis at startup to make sure they have this extension  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then EM will upgrade this extension in next upgrades  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so to summarize, half workspaces translations are broken in subwikis, that's the translation that have been moved to xwiki-platform-workspace-template-features (XWiki.WorkspaceTranslations) when doing an upgrade from pre 5.0  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unfortunately I have no idea why those translations are handled like this  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0creating a jira issue  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-9096  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we need to decide what we do about it  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even if we don't do anything the minimum is to explain in 5.0 RN migration notes that this extension need to be installed on workspaces when upgrading  \n15:21\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:24\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:29\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:31\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n20:08\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:14\u00a0<sburjan\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:20\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:59\u00a0<priyanka\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<priyanka\\_>\u00a0Hello all, I am interested in GSoc Project \"LDAP server implementation\" .
