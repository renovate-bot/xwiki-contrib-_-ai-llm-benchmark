Not with sql you won't.  \n09:11\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0Since all usernames in the POC are the same usernames (except for 1 user) than in the new production server (with ad) I guess migration is simple.  \n09:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I would delete the usernames and have people register.  \n09:12\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0@cjdelisle: your laughing \u00a0tells me I'm in trouble :-)  \n09:13\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0so deleting all accounts on the server. people login again, xwiki thinks they are first users and because they have the same loginname they do not loose their history of pages already made?  \n09:15\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0would that work?  \n09:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0No, more like people register new usernames and their history starts over.  \n09:15\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0well, since we don't use rights management and everyone can change everything there is no real problem, right?  \n09:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:16\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0good morning  \n09:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0A while back someone tried to rename some documents using sql.
