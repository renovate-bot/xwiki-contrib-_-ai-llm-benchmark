(16/07/2008 15:34): (sorry my internet connection breaks every now and then the last days)  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 15:35): hi, does xwiki offer any kind of nice user friendly comparison of historical versions?  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 15:36): what I see is very technical and not very useful for an end user who is not very technical  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 15:36): maybe there is a plug in which does this?  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 15:38): lucaa: \u00a0you are normally very knowledgeable, do you know?  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 15:42): the video at http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/UserGuide/WebHome/history\\_wysiwyg.swf seems to show a nice version with colours down the side  \nxwikibot - (16/07/2008 15:42): UserGuide.WebPreferences was modified by xwiki:XWiki.jvdrean (Added object) -

http://curriki.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/My+Curriki  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:01): tutee: it does not seem extremely technical to me: green lines are added lines and red strikedthrough are deleted  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:01): what exactly is the feature you're looking at?  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:08): lucaa: that is exactly what I want  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:08): but if you go to xwiki.org  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:08): and click show  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:08): >history  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:09): then choose two versions and click compare  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:10): the page does not look like that  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:12): I clicked compare and I got green & red strikedthrough lines in content changes  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:12): you want the side bar? like in the demo?  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:12): well no, I am really confused because what \u00a0I get is not at all what you seem to be getting  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:13): can we both go to http://enterprise.xwiki.org/  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:13): then we both click  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:13): show  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:13): then history  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:13): from 66.1  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:13): to 62.1  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:14): then \"compare selected versions\"  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:14): no strike through, just metadata changes, object changes, etc.  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:16): am I crazy or do you see what I see?  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:17): lucaa: I guess I must be crazy  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:19): don't panic  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:19): you don't see any strikethrough because there are no content changes  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:19): lol, no panic  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:19): I meant don't panic, you're not going crasy  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:19): crazy  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:20): aaah,ok  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:20): so  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:20): well if I wanted it to be like in the .swf would I just need to change skins or is that because it uses an earlier version of xwiki?  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:20): the swf is an earlier version, indeed  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:20): and those are content changes  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:21): and the current content changes are even better! :)  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:21): ok, I understand, thank you  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:22): compare 66.1 with 18.1, for example  \nlucaa - (16/07/2008 16:22): and you'll have the strikethroughs  \ntutee - (16/07/2008 16:30): ok, I see, thank you  \nxwikibot - (16/07/2008 18:00): Main.ReleaseNotesWatch10 was modified by XWiki.lucaa -
