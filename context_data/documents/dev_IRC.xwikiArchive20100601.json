(I'm checking the velocity code but it's not very easy to follow it)  \nvmassol - (09:56): if this were true maybe we're passing the page name where a macro is as the template name  \ntmortagne - (09:57): vmassol: no idea i don't know very well velocity engine  \nvmassol - (09:57): which would explain why ludovic has found that the velocity macro cache is growing  \nvmassol - (09:58): mflorea, tmortagne: do you know what can cause this: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/GroovyClassHelloWorldTutorial?viewer=changes  \nvmassol - (09:58): (the last change)  \nvmassol - (09:59): could it be happening if the user edits in wysiwyg mode and saves?  \nmflorea - (09:59): let me see  \nvmassol - (09:59): I've noticed this kind of changes several times already  \ntmortagne - (10:04): have to go, back in 1/2h  \nmflorea - (10:04): vmassol: indeed, looks like those changes were made with the WYSIWYG editor. Macros have been \"rewritten\" to their standard form  \nvmassol - (10:04): mflorea: ok.. hmm\u2026.so even if someone makes no change it can save changes\u2026.  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:04  \nvmassol - (10:05): I've been wanting a check for some time:  \nvmassol - (10:05): when someone hits saves and no changes has been done then don't save it  \nvmassol - (10:05): (either wiki editor or wysiwyg editor)  \nmflorea - (10:08): that's just a use case. but macros are changed when you type somewhere in a text, so without editing the macros. Preventing save when there are no changes still doesn't stop \"side effects\" like \"= Title\" being transformed into \"= Title =\" and I don't think we can fix this. It's somehow normal.  \nmflorea - (10:08): when you save from WYSIWYG, the content is \"normalized\"  \nvmassol - (10:10): yes I know about normalization  \nmflorea - (10:10): vmassol: IMO we have to accept this. otherwise we need to send additional information to the client to preserve the form of the wiki syntax  \nvmassol - (10:10): the question is whether we still want changes to appear even if the user has not made any change at all  \nvmassol - (10:11): couldn't we do this:  \nvmassol - (10:11): - take the initial content, normalize it  \nvmassol - (10:11): - compare with the content modified by the user  \nmflorea - (10:11): we could  \nvmassol - (10:12): note: it requires in memory twice the space required to fit one page  \narkub joined #xwiki at 10:12  \nmflorea - (10:12): but if the user has just fixed a typo, she/he would still see lots of other changes, due to normalization  \nvmassol - (10:12): mflorea: yes that's a pb too  \nvmassol - (10:13): maybe  \nvmassol - (10:13): we could normalize on wiki edit save  \nvmassol - (10:13): that would solve it  \nvmassol - (10:13): ie we always have normalized content  \nvmassol - (10:14): tmortagne: wdyt?  \nmflorea - (10:14): yes, but might annoy some wiki syntax users, because they have their own \"style\" which is lost when they save the page  \nvmassol - (10:14): I remember we talked about this with tmortagne a long time ago actually  \nvmassol - (10:14): mflorea: actually there's only 1 style  \nvmassol - (10:15): so it's not a matter of style  \nvmassol - (10:15): IMO  \nvmassol - (10:15): what the parser does it support some wrong styles  \nvmassol - (10:15): and fixes them  \nvmassol - (10:15): s/it/is/  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 10:15  \njvdrean left at 10:16 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmflorea - (10:16): writing {{macro}}content{{/macro}} versus {{macro}}]\\ncontent\\n{{/macro}} can be viewed as a style option  \nmflorea - (10:18): I'm +1 for normalizing the content on save btw :)  \nvmassol - (10:18): let's see what tmortagne thinks too  \nmflorea - (10:19): ok  \nvmassol - (10:19): it would make sense  \nvmassol - (10:19): IMO  \nvmassol - (10:19): so the wiki editor and wysiwyg editor will have the same behavior  \nmflorea - (10:19): hmm, what about save&continue?  \ntmortagne - (10:19): vmassol: normalize when save wiki mode has two issue: breaking formating done by some user, they probably used wiki mode especially for this reason (have there own formatting) and also we have lot's of syntaxes that don't have renderer  \nvmassol - (10:20): tmortagne: the second problem is not a problem for xwiki 2.0 syntax  \nvmassol - (10:21): for the first problem, we need to decide  \nmflorea - (10:21): on save&continue we would need to reset the content of the wiki editor text area, which can mean loosing the current caret position  \nvmassol - (10:21): but if we agree that there's only one style  \ntmortagne - (10:21): vmassol: sure but anyway IMO it's \u00f9more work to do at save time which is useless  \nvmassol - (10:21): then it's normal  \ntmortagne - (10:21): so i don't like it very much  \nvmassol - (10:21): otherwise the wysiwyg editor shouldn't change the style eitehr  \nvmassol - (10:21): it's not logical  \nvmassol - (10:21): we don't support custom styles in the rendering  \nvmassol - (10:21): there's only 1 style supported right now  \ntmortagne - (10:24): i still feel it's a useless work done at save time, users will more and more use WYSIWYG and wiki mode will mostly be used when you have a velocity macro around the whole content or things like that and in that case nothing is normalize inside macros  \nvmassol - (10:25): tmortagne: I'm fine to choose whatever strategy but it needs to be the same both editors  \nvmassol - (10:25): we cannot have the wysiwyg editor perform normalization when the wiki editor deson't do it  \nvmassol - (10:25): or vice-versa  \ntmortagne - (10:25): the WYSIWYG doe snot not do any normalization on pupose  \ntmortagne - (10:25): it convert html -> xwiki/2.0  \nvmassol - (10:25): I know  \nvmassol - (10:26): but from the user pov that's called normalization  \ntmortagne - (10:26): and i really don't see why \"we cannot have the wysiwyg editor perform normalization when the wiki editor deson't do it\"  \nvmassol - (10:26): well it seems obvious to me  \nvmassol - (10:26): the reason why I've just brought this topic for ex  \ntmortagne - (10:26): user ill really don't understand that the content he written in wiki editor changed  \nvmassol - (10:26): I'm a tech user  \nvmassol - (10:27): I create content in wiki mode  \nvmassol - (10:27): I pay attention to my style  \nvmassol - (10:27): then someone edits the page in wyswig mode  \nvmassol - (10:27): and breaks all my styles!  \ntmortagne - (10:27): maybe default style is not good enough  \nvmassol - (10:27): again see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/GroovyClassHelloWorldTutorial?viewer=changes  \nvmassol - (10:27): the guys has not touched a single line  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 10:27  \nvmassol - (10:27): but changed lots of places  \nvmassol - (10:28): and if he had made 1 typo change  \ntmortagne - (10:28): \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/GroovyClassHelloWorldTutorial?viewer=changes is not about normalization  \nvmassol - (10:28): it would be hard to see it  \ntmortagne - (10:28): since there is no change  \nvmassol - (10:28): since it's mixed with normalization changes  \ntmortagne - (10:28): it's because when you do bsolutely nothing the document is still saved  \nvmassol - (10:28): tmortagne: ok imagine he changed one char  \nvmassol - (10:29): and re when there's no change see above  \nvmassol - (10:29): we talked about it with marius above  \ntmortagne - (10:29): you take \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/GroovyClassHelloWorldTutorial?viewer=changes as an example i just explained why it's not a valid example...  \nvmassol - (10:29): it's costly to check for that  \nvmassol - (10:29): tmortagne: be a little imaginative :)  \nvmassol - (10:29): and imagine he also modified one char  \ntmortagne - (10:29): and ?  \nvmassol - (10:30): \"vmassol  \nvmassol - (10:30): 10:26  \nvmassol - (10:30): I'm a tech user  \nvmassol - (10:30): 10:27  \nvmassol - (10:30): I create content in wiki mode  \nvmassol - (10:30): 10:27  \nvmassol - (10:30): I pay attention to my style  \nvmassol - (10:30): 10:27  \nvmassol - (10:30): then someone edits the page in wyswig mode  \nvmassol - (10:30): 10:27  \nvmassol - (10:30): and breaks all my styles!\"  \ntmortagne - (10:30): sure and i answered to that, and normalize in wiki mode will not fix your use case  \ntmortagne - (10:30): it will make it worst  \ntmortagne - (10:31): bacause yo\u00e7u can\"'t even jeep your style in wiki mode in this case  \ntmortagne - (10:31): s/jeep/keep/  \nvmassol - (10:31): as I said I'\"m fine with both ways  \nvmassol - (10:31): but they need to be in sync between both editors  \nvmassol - (10:31): and not normalizing is hard to do for the rendering engine  \nvmassol - (10:32): since it means saving extra information about the user style  \nvmassol - (10:32): which we don't support  \nvmassol - (10:32): so right now the easiest solution is to always normalize  \nvmassol - (10:32): now we need to decide if that's acceptable  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 10:32  \nvmassol - (10:32): IMO it's ok if we explain that the xwiki syntax 2.0 has only one syntax  \nvmassol - (10:33): of course I'd also prefer the other solution to keep the user style but that's hard to do  \ntmortagne - (10:33): there is also another minus: it makes the page more fragile because it means if there is any bug in xwiki/2.0 renderer you will never be able to put the content you wanted even if you don't need xwiki/2.0 renderer since you provide the source  \ntmortagne - (10:36): i would really prefer having a way to be able to put the real unmodified source, it's also need simply when i want to test something with the xwiki/2.0 parser  \ntmortagne - (10:36): if we normalize by default it should be possible to save without normalizing IMO  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:41  \ntmortagne - (10:42): i don't see the \"WYSIWYG has limitations lets apply the same limitations everywhere\" as a good thing to do  \nvmassol - (10:43): tmortagne: sure, but it's not the wysiwyg it's the rendering engine which has this limitation  \nvmassol - (10:43): do you have a proposal for the rendering engine to remove this limitation?  \nvmassol - (10:43): (we talked about it briefly in the past but not in great details)  \nvmassol - (10:43): (and it sounded complex)  \ntmortagne - (10:43): vmassol: it doe snot have any limitation whe you provide the source  \ntmortagne - (10:44): from user POV the limitation is on the WYSIWYG  \nvmassol - (10:44): yes  \nvmassol - (10:44): but technically to solve it we need to the renderers to know about positional stuff  \nvmassol - (10:44): s/to the/the+  \ntmortagne - (10:46): we need parser to provide about positional stuff anyway for many use case but that's not the tricky part, the tricky part is to not loose this information in the WYSIWYG IMO  \ntmortagne - (10:46): and i think it would make the WYSIWYG way too complex  \ntmortagne - (10:48): plus doing thing based on positional stuff is pretty much impossible when you go to another syntax and so modification  \ntmortagne - (10:48): it doe snot make sense to have xwiki/2.0 syntax positions in the XHTML  \ntmortagne - (10:49): s/so modification/do modification/  \ntmortagne - (10:50): IMO it's impossible to support custom formatting in WYSIWYG if we want to keep it clean and generic (i.e. not knowing about xwiki/2.0 syntax details)  \ntmortagne - (10:52): but again i really don't see major issue on WYSIWYG and Wiki editor not doing exactly the same thing  \ntmortagne - (10:52): complex custom formatting is generally more inside macro like velocity  \ntmortagne - (10:54): with pure wiki macro i don't thing you want that much special formatting  \ntmortagne - (10:54): and if the default formating \u00a0of some thing like lists are not good we can change it i think  \nmflorea - (10:57): I agree with tmortagne re WYSIWYG and rendering complexity and I don't think it would bring much value to be able to keep the style when editing in WYSIWYG mode. It would be nice though to be able to normalize the wiki editor content, maybe not by default, but as an option. We could even have a shortcut like Ctrl+F (in Eclipse) to normalize the content while editing.  \ntmortagne - (10:58): mflorea: yep Eclipse like formating (i.e. when you want it) would be nice  \nvmassol - (10:58): mflorea: sure but that doesn't solve the problem that brought this discussion  \ntmortagne - (10:58): it would be a feature instead of a limitation ;)  \nmflorea - (11:00): vmassol: sure, but if you care about changes and diffs you'll be able to format your wiki syntax so that WYSIWYG editing will have fewer side effects  \ntmortagne - (11:01): or you will use the WYSIWYG  \nmflorea - (11:01): ;) yep  \ntmortagne - (11:03): as i said previously, WYSIWYG is supposed to support anything and will make wiki mode more and more rare use case, also if you want normalized wiki editor you can use WYSIWYG source editor  \nvmassol - (11:06): tmortagne: I'm egarly for this to be ture  \nvmassol - (11:06): true  \nvmassol - (11:06): but I don't feel it's anywhere close  \nvmassol - (11:06): for started the editor should start as fast as the wiki edotr  \nvmassol - (11:06): editor  \nvmassol - (11:06): s/started/starter/  \ntmortagne - (11:07): vmassol: true or not now that's the goal we always had for the WYSIWG and it will be true at some point  \nvmassol - (11:07): re wysiwyg source editor I still have a problem with that vs the wiki editor  \nvmassol - (11:07): I still believe we need only one and not 2  \nvmassol - (11:07): but let's not discuss that one now :)  \nvmassol - (11:07): (I'm in \u00a0a meeting right now)  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 11:11  \nanna left at 11:13 (Quit: anna  \nyomgui1 joined #xwiki at 11:21  \nanamarias left at 11:21 (Quit: anamarias  \nyomgui1 - (11:21): Hello  \njvelo joined #xwiki at 11:27  \nyomgui1 - (11:30): I'm testing xWiki Watch and I've made a group for my feeds.

Thanks.  \ntmortagne - (15:29): i was a bit lazy on the jira issue part (reused the old one), you can fix it if you want ;)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (15:30): I have to get testing invitation.  \nsilviar left at 16:06 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne - (16:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: btw there is still inline/standalone issues in Configurable views  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:10): I thought I fixed that, where is it?  \ntmortagne - (16:11): see XHTML validity tests on http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/864/testReport/  \ntmortagne - (16:11): for example the whole Search view is inside a <p> it seems  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:12): So the problem is that codeToExecute is running inside of a <p> block?  \ntmortagne - (16:12): probably  \ntmortagne - (16:13): i tough i already fixed something like that  \ntmortagne - (16:13): there is also basic XHTML issue on Registration page  \ntmortagne - (16:14): basically i think most of the XHTML issues on http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/864/testReport/ are related to Configurable  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:14): I know about that, it's because the core doesn't attach an id attribute to checkboxes.  \ntmortagne - (16:14): axcept PAnelWizard abviously  \ntmortagne - (16:15): CalebJamesDeLisl: yep i remember you created an issue for that  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:15): I have been meaning to look at it.  \nDenis - (16:15): CalebJamesDeLisl: I have a patch that does that  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:16): Awesome. \u00a0\u00a0What do you guys think about exposing XDOM manipulation functions to velocity?  \nDenis - (16:17): applewebdata://53BF0A44-7846-4A4B-9A31-C16AD2C80E8D/jira/browse/XWIKI-4585  \ntmortagne - (16:17): CalebJamesDeLisl: WDYM ?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:18): So code like configurable can build the XDOM tree manually instead of this fragile templating.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:18): Like javascript.  \ntmortagne - (16:19): you can do that in wiki macro  \ntmortagne - (16:20): in the page itself it's a bit more complex to find the proper API to be able to do that  \ntmortagne - (16:21): but we could simply do the same thing that wiki macro, expose some $output binding in all the script macros  \ntmortagne - (16:22): s/that/than/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:22): Also I think we'd have to expose classes because there is no 'new' in velocity.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:23): maybe a createElement function?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:23): It would be nice to have a reference to the place where the script output would go.  \ntmortagne - (16:24): for velocity we could have a velosity tools to provide thing velocity can't do  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:24): It would also be nice to be able to manipulate the top menus and panels (when they go to syntax2.0)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:25): I think it would be a big selling point that developers can build a webpage just like javascript.  \ntmortagne - (16:27): you can already cover many uses cases with macros, but yes it's not difficult to do the same thing we do for wiki macro in script macros in general  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:28): It's also great for security. I'd say 90% of all modern security issues come from concatenation of privileged code with unprivileged \"content\".  \ntmortagne - (16:28): it's just about give to the script the possibility to directly decide of the XDOM the velocity macro will return instead of having to print something that the script macro will then parse, it's the exact same use case than wiki macro that made me adding this support to them  \nanna joined #xwiki at 16:28  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:29): Great. I'll push it to my \"todo\" stack ;)  \ntmortagne - (16:31): CalebJamesDeLisl: you can create a \"new feature\" or \"idea\" jira issue to not forget about it (that's own i do my todo list usually ;))  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (16:31): Good idea, I'll do that later today.  \ntmortagne - (16:33): s/own/how/  \ndegro joined #xwiki at 16:39  \ndegro - (16:39): hey, guys  \njvelo - (16:40): hi  \ndegro - (16:40): does anybody know if (and how) I can override a template programatically rather than declaratively by modifying the skin?  \ndegro - (16:40): my context is the following: I want to customize the pdf export template without modifying the skin and override the pdfheader.vm and pdffooter.vm templates  \njvelo - (16:43): you mean \u00a0without modifying the skin nor override the pdfheader.vm and pdffooter.vm templates?  \ndegro - (16:44): nope, i meant to say that i do want to override those and use my own code, all of this without modifying the template files on disk  \njvelo - (16:45): you can create a wiki skin  \ndegro - (16:46): this pdf format is solely for an application, not for the entire wiki to use - and also, I want this to work on any wiki install, with any skin  \njvelo - (16:46): it seems you want 2 things that are incompatible  \ndegro - (16:46): :)  \njvelo - (16:46): not that it would be impossible to do programmatically  \njvelo - (16:46): but I'm not sure you want to do that  \njvelo - (16:47): it would be even more painful to maintain in my opinion  \ndegro - (16:48): sigh  \njvelo - (16:48): maybe what you need is a different PDF struts action for your custom PDF export  \njvelo - (16:48): that does something different than the generic one  \njvelo - (16:49): I don't know really your need  \njvelo - (16:49): but overriding velocity templates dynamically doesn't sound like a good idea to me  \ndegro - (16:49): oh, so you mean overriding the whole 'export' action?  \njvelo - (16:49): I mean having a different one for your application that have different needs  \njvelo - (16:50): (and keep the generic one)  \njvelo - (16:51): why can't you modify the templates ?  \ndegro - (16:52): I can, actually, and use them only at export time in a query string  \ndegro - (16:52): and that is what I'll do  \ndegro - (16:53): I mean I'll use bin/export/.../&skin=MySpace.MyCustomSkin and I'll attach the modified pdf.vm template to that document (kudos sdumitriu)  \ndegro - (16:54): I had thought that I have to apply an entirely new skin to the wiki, in order to use custom templates  \nanamarias left at 17:11 (Quit: anamarias  \nanna left at 17:12 (Quit: anna  \nsburjan` left at 17:14 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 17:23  \nmariusbutuc joined #xwiki at 17:41  \nvmassol - (17:49): tmortagne: back.
