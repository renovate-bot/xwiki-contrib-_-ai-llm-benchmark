Maybe tmortagne \u00a0can have a look?  \n08:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're probably flickers but they all seem to happen; maybe that info could help to fix the issue?  \n08:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll fix the mail test issue  \n08:44\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:11\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0hi all  \n09:11\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0what is the reason usernames with a dot are not allowed in xwiki?

But yes, the default values are set on Sandbox  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica:  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0new pages where?  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the user picks the location?  \n17:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Help/Templates/#HExamples click on Try it! button from top  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok that's sadnbox  \n17:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the location is sugested, but he could change it  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's fine  \n17:23\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: apparently someone create some templates. I wonder how they could have access the Administration - Template provider  \n17:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I'm happy that they did it :) but not sure they should have had the rights  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I noticed that some users were able to change the language in the past too  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to find how they do this  \n17:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0loool \u2026 no never mind - it's in the code  \n17:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0it's Marius code \u2026 sorry  \n17:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0we created them :)  \n17:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the language thing I guess it's a cache bug  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lol :)  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I've updated the instructions  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that the users can only edit blog and sandbox spaces  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so now we'll need to resave the DB....  \n17:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well it's not really playground in this case  \n17:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0if we restore it, they could play with it  \n17:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the problem is that Main.WebHome has the register instructions  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess the best would be for me to wait till midnight and do it just at that time ;)  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that + when the wiki is defaced it's not nice  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't represent the default wiki any more  \n17:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the playground is not a personal wiki  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't offer that  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to register on xwiki cloud for thzt  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to register on xwiki cloud for that  \n17:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(xwiki sas cloud that is)  \n17:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0we don't offer a personal, since it's reseted every day  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should have checked playground a few minutes ago :)  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(before I reverted the home)  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was a mess  \n17:29\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well \u2026 that means testing  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"we don't offer a personal, since it's reseted every day\"  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no that's not the reason  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reason is that it's hard to offer a personal wiki and it costs resourcesd  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no that doesn't mean testing  \n17:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it means testing only for the person who did this  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not for the one coming after and seing that and leaving without doing anything  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is exactly what happened  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that person commented on a site so I saw it  \n17:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that's why I noticed that the permissions were not correct anymore  \n17:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I understand \u2026 still I think we should allow users to do stuff there, otherwise it's just a 'view' mode, they can't really 'play'  \n17:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0Administration is not accessible \u2026 anyway, as you said they have Cloud as option  \n17:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: trying to use the openid connect authenticator. (bad timing with tmortagne being away). Any idea why, inside a resource handler (/xwiki/oidc/) I do not see a session attribute that was set in a previous request? i.e. authenticator sets session attribute, redirects to provider, that redirects back to the authenticator's wiki on the /xwiki/oidc/ resource, but the session is empty.  \n17:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we just don't allow them to break the home nor the dashboard  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they can play in the sandbox and in the blog  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not a personal wiki  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma: sorry no idea. If some value is set in the servlet session there's no reason you wouldn't see them inside any code  \n17:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Authenticator: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/oidc/blob/master/oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/OIDCAuthServiceImpl.java#L171  \n17:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Resource callback: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/oidc/blob/master/oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/endpoint/CallbackOIDCEndpoint.java#L91  \n17:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the only difference I spot is that the resource callback gets the session directly from the Container  \n17:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0while the authenticator, initially, gets it from the XWikiContext's Request  \n17:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0BTW, how do we create an EventListerner that listen to every events?  \n17:43\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0currently the eventlister has to return a list of events that it listen  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good question :)  \n17:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0do we need to change something in commons?  \n17:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I think you can do it with a Regex matcher listener  \n17:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0we have that?  \n17:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0hmm, that only works for filtering the documents  \n17:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Looks like we already have it: org.xwiki.observation.event.AllEvent  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I was wondering if we had an AllEvent  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n18:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I see  \n18:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0nic  \n18:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*nice  \n18:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: you wrote \"Use one of AS param1 to param5 to log the audience foreign key.\"  \n18:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0no  \n18:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's an N\\*N relationship  \n18:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's the audience which will have a foreign key to the activity ie, not the other way  \n18:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0s/ie/id  \n18:21\u00a0<Silicium>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:21\u00a0<Silicium>\u00a0hi there  \n18:23\u00a0<Silicium>\u00a0i'am running a xwiki testinstallation for evaluation purpose and deleted \\_all\\_ pages. so now the wiki is entirely empty  \n18:24\u00a0<Silicium>\u00a0why is that possible? and why can i even delete the administration page? i'am not able to install any extension or manage the application at all  \n18:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Silicium: yes in XWiki you are able to delete all pages  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: ok please correct my mistake then!  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0even those which are important  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Silicium: you can either  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) reinstall the pages  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) undelete them from the trash using a script  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Silicium: but in the next release (in 1 week or so) you will have a confirmation message about that problem eveytime you want to delete important page  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you're curious about the scripted restore: http://snippets.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Restore+Documents  \n18:27\u00a0<Silicium>\u00a0thx!  \n18:28\u00a0<Silicium>\u00a0vmassol: i dont have groovy installed yet, how can i execute the script?  \n18:28\u00a0<Silicium>\u00a0i mean i can install groovy but i need properties too to connect to the db etc ?  \n18:43\u00a0<flyingpot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:49\u00a0<flyingpot>\u00a0has quit  \n18:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:52\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n19:53\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:02\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n20:09\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<sorinello\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<sorinello\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:27\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n20:32\u00a0<flyingpot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:37\u00a0<flyingpot>\u00a0has quit  \n20:46\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:15\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:16\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has quit  \n22:23\u00a0<sorinello\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:27\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n22:29\u00a0<sorinello\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n22:29\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:29\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:37\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n22:40\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:40\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit\n"}
