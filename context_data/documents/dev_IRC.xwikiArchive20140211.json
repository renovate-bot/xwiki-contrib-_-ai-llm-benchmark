I wonder why \u00a0chat is still working ...)  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's also easy to check directly in the xwiki.org DB  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it's easier to look at the document in a script directly in xwiki.org at least to understand where that null come from exactly, I will check it  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so the null value come from the property parse in object 1 of class \"XWiki.StyleSheetExtension\"  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is a boolean property  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0boolean property class actually but a number property  \n14:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a null number sounds pretty weird to be  \n14:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/be/me/  \n14:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0NumberProperty#toText() seems to think it's possible (unless it's just bulletproofing for bulletproofing)  \n14:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from UI point of view parse is \"---\" so I guess that how null is used  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway the export should not crash whatever the value, let do some bulletproofing  \n15:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:12\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: yes  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0forget that  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I was looking at older message :)  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0export should be ok now  \n15:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok ... well me got kicked by localnetwork problems anyway ;)  \n15:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, the element should just not be shown for null values  \n15:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so in some way the extra check in DateXarObjectPropertySerializer \u00a0would not really be necessary  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I could have written a NumberXarObjectPropertySerializer but from what I can see putting empty string instead of null is how all properties behave  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yes I could remove the null check in DateXarObjectPropertySerializer  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but DateXarObjectPropertySerializer is not only about that :)  \n15:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, and I just mean \"if I understand correctly, then in theory one could remove the null check\" , not \"hey, lets remove that null check in 5.4.1 and see if I got it right\" \u00a0;)  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you beat me by 1 second evalica ;)  \n15:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0:)  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(well 1 min actually not second)  \n15:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n15:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ClemensR: I guess if the code is now on contrib the version upload can be handle by maven \u2026 if you confide the extension page accordingly  \n15:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0\\*configure  \n15:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess that is not really necessary ... the pom is not set up for being build automatically  \n15:44\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:51\u00a0<dpatriche>\u00a0has quit  \n15:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: so we want to keep 5.2 branch on jenkins (an in general) ?
