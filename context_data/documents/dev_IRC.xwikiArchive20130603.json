\u00a0I have tried to disable it everywhere I can find, deleting it from the style yet it still appears  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0altker1281: I don't think it's meant to be disabled  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now what you do easily is edit the activity macro  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's your use case?  \n11:44\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0vmassol: Internal use. \u00a0I find the activity stream very distracting.  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(why do you wish to \"disable\" it?)  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just don't use it  \n11:44\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0I'm not trying to  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0edit the home page  \n11:44\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0It still shows up on all pages  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all pages?  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you're talking about something else  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the AS is only displayed in 2 places  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0default home page + user profile  \n11:45\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0If I create a space and go into it I see  \n11:45\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0\"Documents in space <name>\" \" Activity Stream for space <name>\"  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it's possible it's put in default space too  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's far from \"all the pages\"  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0space home page is not all pages....  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes that's controllable too  \n11:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you decide what you want to have  \n11:46\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0In the layout, right?  \n11:46\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0\"Look and Feel\"  \n11:47\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0So I've tried what I know to disable it from Layout / Look and Feel and I'm at a loss.  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it 's not very well documented I think  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration+Application#HTemplatesCreationandAdministration  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0specifically edit Dashboard/SpaceDashboardTemplate  \n11:50\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0This will sound dumb but I can't figure out where to actually edit Dashboard/SpaceDashboardTemplate  \n11:51\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0Space, Dashboard, Administer Space (at the top)?  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0altker1281: on any page press ctrl+g  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then type SpaceDashboardTemplate and select it  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then edit it and make the template look the way you want it  \n11:54\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0When should the changes take effect?  \n11:55\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0So I just created a new space and it works, that's great!  \n11:56\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0How do I change it for the Wiki Home and other spaces that might have already been created?  \n11:59\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0Guys, sorry to keep asking these types of questions, I really like what XWiki offers but some of these \"defaults\" are a bit overwhelming.  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0altker1281: you can edit the existing pages  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just go to them and edit, you should be able to choose what you want  \n12:02\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0tmortagne: I would like to, but as dumb as it sounds, I don't know \"where\" to go.  \n12:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand, go to a page where you see the activity stream  \n12:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and edit it  \n12:03\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0Ah!  \n12:03\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0Ok  \n12:04\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0tmortagne: Thank you.  \n12:04\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0I thought I had to edit the look/feel somewhere  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK SpaceDashboardTemplate is simply copied when you create a new space  \n12:05\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0This is really great.  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are removing AS for visual reason or performances ?  \n12:05\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0tmortagne: Visual  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n12:05\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0tmortagne: My brain does not deal well with visual overload.  \n12:07\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0One more \"dumb\" question , is there a better widget or extention that provides a Navigation / Location Bar? \u00a0For example if I am Adminstering 'Main' and I want to get back to the main page, I didn't find an easy way to do that. \u00a0The \"WIki: xwiki\" and \"Space: Main\" sometimes behave as drop-down rather than \"click to go here\"  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: Packager Plugin build is a real pain, it constantly failing...  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I can look into it after lunch. Does it fail locally for you?  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I doubt it will but there is always a new thing it does not like on jenkins agents  \n12:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0altker1281: actually you can click on it but it's on the name of the element that the link is  \n12:10\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0tmortagne: OK, so if I add a space (I have one called 'Android') and I want to go back to my main list of spaces, right now the navigator says \"Space: Android\" so how do I go back?  \n12:10\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0Hrm. \u00a0Right above the name of the space I see \"Wiki Home -> Dashboard -> Android\"  \n12:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0altker1281: where is your list of spaces ? if it's the main page of the wiki then you go to the wiki button  \n12:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can use the breadcrumb in this case too  \n12:12\u00a0<altker1281>\u00a0Is that an extention or the name of the thing I was just referencing?

I have a XAR which contains pages names: \"QA.MySQL 5\\.2\" and when importing the XAR, these pages do not show up. After I press the import button, I get these pages in a section called \"List of skipped documents\". This looks like a bug to me  \n14:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it doesn't look ok for me to be able to correctly export pages, but don;t be able to re-import them back  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n14:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: should I report it ?  \n14:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0maybe I am hitting an exotic use-case, like page with \".\" in their name and escaped with backslash  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: yes you should report it  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with an easy way to reproduce  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0attach your failing xar for example  \n14:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes sir  \n14:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: it is not common use case but it is still a supported use case so yes it's an important bug (and whatever the use case you should always be able to import something you exported)  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not very recent tmortagne, does it mean we missed a lof of translations in the past? :)  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you mean ?  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just moved below  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I had just read the title and not the full diff  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not the important change actually  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I really moved them from XEM to platform on l10n  \n15:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok got it  \n15:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, tmortagne : I found out the issue. It seems that mvn xar:format or mvn xar:package do something to the page which make it impossible to import  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: so it's working if you import the XAR you just exported ?  \n15:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, yes  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so it's less important but still not very nice  \n15:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but if I unpack the xar, put the pages in a maven module and run mvn xar:format and mvn xar:package, I am not able to re-import it. It's like the xar is empty. I am trying to see the diff before and after executing the xar plugin  \n15:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, they have some differences ... I'll report it  \n15:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0for example: \"<language></language>\" vs. \"<language/>\"  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is not an issue  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it doe snot change anything from XML point of view  \n15:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0look at pages name and space  \n15:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: same name, same space, same parent.  \n15:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0odd  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: it's probably an issue with the package.xml then  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the pages in there are not properly escaped  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so when you import it none of the listed pages are found in the XAR so it does not import anything  \n15:28\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, indeed you are right. \"<file language=\"\" defaultAction=\"0\">Main.XWiki 5.0.2</file>\" vs. \"<file defaultAction=\"0\" language=\"\">Main.XWiki 5\\.0\\.2</file>\"  \n15:30\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am going to report this  \n15:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, : xar packager issues should be reported in COmmons, right ?  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not packager plugin, it's xar plugin and yes it's in commons  \n15:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, odd, I can't find it in components in JIRA  \n15:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0(xar plugin)  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we usually don't create component for tools  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0put all that in build test etc  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a build tool  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Build, Infrastructure and Tests\"  \n15:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thanks  \n15:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, reported: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-407  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: ok thanks  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I found where the issue is  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this.space == null ? this.name : this.space + \".\" + this.name;  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a bit old ;)  \n15:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: pre document reference era :)  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and I'm sure we still have other places like this  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but in this case it's work than pre document reference, it's also without document reference since it's in commons  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I have to add a hack  \n15:49\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well it's not blocking me from anything, it just popped out and I reported it.
