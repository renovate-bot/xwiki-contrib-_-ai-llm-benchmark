However, some extensions are not adapted for Nested Pages yet, and their execution is still sub-optimal. For the next releases, we plan to work on the adaptation of these extensions.  \n14:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0not exactly about UI  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes ok, I'll make it a bit more visible, thanks  \n14:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I hesitated to put at the very top, just before Nested Pages  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: wdyt about the new message?  \n14:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0not bad :)  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the new terminology is now Nested Pages?  \n14:13\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's because you wanted to replace Document by Page  \n14:13\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so I found it more logicial  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so Nested Page replaces Nested Documents  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but Nested Spaces is still valid  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got it  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ok  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back to the release  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we shuld go ahead without the security issue because  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) it's not new and we can fix it in 7.3 (or a 7.2.1 if need be)  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) we really need to release now to start progressing fast on the 7.3 release (see my roadmap email on the list and the little time we have till the end of the year)  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03) we need the max feedback on 7.2  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n14:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0It's ok to me  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0+1  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok?  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n14:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and my patch is only an improvment that do no garrantee it fixes this issue  \n14:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0then  \n14:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0[ANN] I'm going to release 7.2, please hold your commits  \n14:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0(on that branch)  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hoping that your last commits didn't break anything :)  \n14:22\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0well, the patch does not look harmful, the worse could be a performance degradation  \n14:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it was a revert  \n14:22\u00a0<Denis2>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still would need some full rebuild and some additional tests I think  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have the feeling it might be better to work on it in 7.3  \n14:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: to be sure, git diff e3e402fd77b3c78b47acae6f98dc1d9904aee075..HEAD returns nothing  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: talking about your other commit  \n14:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0which one?  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0about the more action on the right  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you just comitted something no?  \n14:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's on stable-7.1.x  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0didn't see that  \n14:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and stable-6.4.x  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n14:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: by the way you will probably be interested by the new git worktree introduced in git 2.5  \n14:28\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: it does what my script does, without the bug? ^^  \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it allows several worktree in the same repository  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0kind of several clones without cloning  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from what I understood it more or less several clones sharing the same git \"database\"  \n14:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did not tried it yet but I will  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in the case of xwiki-platform git history size it's a bug improvement :)  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/bug/big/  \n14:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: just realized we don't have anymore the shortcuts to the various part of your profile in the top level menu :(  \n14:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so now for ex to switch the user to display hidden docs, it's one click more\u2026 was already a pain. Now it's possibly more logical as it is now, I'll think about a solution specific for the switching hidden pages. I hope there are no other important use cases as otherwise it's going to be a usability degradation  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll see if users complain  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should be easy to add back some sub menu though  \n14:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0should I get the translations?
