 \n08:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0altker128: give more memory to the JVM (see recommended values on xwiki.org), restart and reindex (admin page)  \n08:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:33\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: I did allocate more memory but I can't find the admin page  \n08:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0check your top level menus  \n08:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0be sure to be logged in with an admin user too  \n08:34\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: I didn't even get far enough to create such a user  \n08:34\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: It crashed while doing the very initial setup  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what setup?  \n08:35\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: Well, when you first run xwiki via the webgui  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Distribution Wizard?  \n08:35\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: I think so  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well the DW restarts by itself to continue where it left off  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what do you see when you restart xwiki?  \n08:37\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: checking  \n08:37\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: It feels hung  \n08:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nothing is displayed?  \n08:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0blank screen?  \n08:38\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: It feels like tomcat died, nothing is coming up on ip:8080 . \u00a0I may just switch over to Debain from FreeBSD and start with the .DEBs  \n08:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you said you restarted t  \n08:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it cannot die  \n08:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either you restarted it or you didn't  \n08:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check tomcat logs too  \n08:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or you just pick the xwiki standalone distribution  \n08:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you're done in less than 1 minute  \n08:40\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: XWiki standalone == does not need tomcat?  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it uses jetty  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all packaged in the zip  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jetty + hsqldb  \n08:40\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: Is there any \"real\" disadvantage to that approach?  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0altker128: please check the web site  \n08:40\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0hrm...hsqldb I think will chug as more gets added  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all this is documented  \n08:40\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0yeah  \n08:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have no idea what you're doing  \n08:41\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: Just setting up a personal wiki  \n08:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was jsut answering initially to a question about stuck indexing  \n08:41\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: I like XWiki because of all the useful plugins  \n08:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n08:41\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: No problem  \n08:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll have to go soon (I'm on holidays today ;))  \n08:42\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: OK, no problem. \u00a0I'll try to re-index, if not I may seriously dump the FreeBSD setup  \n08:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you keep talking about some indexing?  \n08:43\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: Sorry  \n08:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only indexing that exists is the lucene indexing but from what you say that's not your issue at all here  \n08:43\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0At this point, no evreything has stopped responding  \n08:43\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0but I'll tackle it one problem at a time.  \n08:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just verify your tomcat logs  \n08:48\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: I have it re-running. \u00a0I have Wiki, Space, Page , at the top right, Register, Log-in, Apps: Blog, Dashboard  \n08:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sounds good  \n08:49\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0vmassol: How to pick it up where things got left off?  \n08:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you see what you described it means all is finished  \n08:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you have anything not working? :)  \n08:50\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0Well, if I want to do administrative tasks, do I need to create those entries in the database, or is the password default? \u00a0I thought maybe the \"wizard\" that runs on the first-run would help me figure that stuff out  \n08:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0altker128: I have no idea what you chose to do in the Distributino Wizard  \n08:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you followed the normal process you'll have an Admin user created  \n09:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0good morning. vmassol , mflorea : I have a question about DW. I want to upgrade my myxwiki.org instance to 5.0.1. I am asked if this is a new install or an upgrade. I select upgrade, and I have to choose the previous version which was installed. The problem that the latest version I have in the dropdown is 4.2-M2, nothing newer like 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 or 5.0. Is this normal ?  \n10:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, select the latest then modify it  \n10:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0mflorea: ok, so I click the pencil icon and put 5.0 for example instead of 4.2-milestone-2, leaving the artefactId unchanged ?  \n10:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0put whatever version you have currently installed  \n10:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n10:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0any hint on how can I see which UI version do I have installed ? :)  \n10:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0what maybe is confusing is the label \"Previous Version\" maybe it should be called \"Previous Version of the User Interface\" (although is kind of long)  \n10:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you should know it  \n10:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0although is in the \"User Interface\" section  \n10:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0evalica: yes, you're inside the User Interface section  \n10:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0no no, I am not confusing it. Problem is that users might forget. For example, I did :)  \n10:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0first time I thought it asked the previous farm version  \n10:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and I wanted to put 4.5.3  \n10:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0because users usually when they hear upgrade they imagine that the system knows already it's version, thus migrates tot the latest. IMO this is a thing users shouldn't care/know.  \n10:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the thing is that this is supposed to be done by admins \u2026 but for normal users is confusing  \n10:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0in my case it's blocking because I don't know what to choose :)  \n10:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0nad I am an admin (of my subwiki)  \n10:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\\*and  \n10:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I never upgraded or touched incubator \u2026. I never installed anything on it :) I selected the closest in that select  \n10:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0great, I get Skol during migration on myxwiki.org  \n10:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0at least we cover also this use case and see what bugs we get  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: please report all issues you have  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you shouldn't need to ask any question  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you need then it means it fails the standard user test :)  \n10:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes it kinda of does :(  \n10:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I'll report them. But I;m sure they will be closed as invalid  \n10:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0again: we should really decide what our target is: normal users or admins  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re the version of your existing UI nobody knows on myxwiki.org  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: admins  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but admins are normal users  \n10:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but I am an admin and I don';t know my previous version  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially on myxwiki.org  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n10:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0you should know it since you created the wiki :)  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nobody knows what's on myxwiki.org for 2 reasons  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- someone installed the first UI for them based on a myxwiki template  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- or they updated some part of the UI when it broke a long time ago (as it happened to me for massol.myxwiki.org and thus you don't remember what you had before)  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: you mean the sorin2 wiki?  \n10:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: yes, I am still struggling to upgrade it, but running into different sort of issues :)  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw i'm on holidays today, leaving soon :)  \n10:43\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0I noticed with XWiki + tomcat7, page loads felt slow (server is a Quad-Core-i7 machine with 8GB of RAM). \u00a0Are there any reasonable tips to make XWiki more responsive in addition to the RAM tuning?  \n10:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, only today ? :)  \n10:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: can you delete sorin2 and re-create it in the same way you did yesterday ? I have to start over the migration.
