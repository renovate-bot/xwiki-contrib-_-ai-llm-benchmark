I haven't used database list class yet  \nphreeza - (17/10/2008 13:59): vmassol: ok thanks for your reply. I'm going to send the question to xwiki-users, maybe someone there has an idea.  \nvmassol - (17/10/2008 14:00): yep  \njvdrean - (17/10/2008 14:00): phreeza  \njvdrean - (17/10/2008 14:00): a) in your mapping file I'd suggest that you stick to simple types like strings  \njvdrean - (17/10/2008 14:01): in xwiki database lists are store as strings in the db  \njvdrean - (17/10/2008 14:01): this type is here to allow you to build a complex \"edit displayer\" (ie: being able to populate a select input with the result of a hibernate query)  \nphreeza - (17/10/2008 14:05): jvdrean: thanks once again for your help. it seems like a very powerful tool. I'll think about whether i can make it work with just strings.  \nxwikibot - (17/10/2008 14:21): Main.ReleaseNotes was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotes  \nxwikibot - (17/10/2008 14:22): Main.ReleaseNotes was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotes  \nxwikibot - (17/10/2008 14:28): Main.ReleaseNotesXEM14 was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXEM14  \nxwikibot - (17/10/2008 14:32): Main.ReleaseNotesXEM14 was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXEM14  \nxwikibot - (17/10/2008 15:46): Main.ReleaseNotesXEM14 was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXEM14  \nvmassol - (17/10/2008 16:01): guys is the build working for you?
