 \n16:38\u00a0<zwindler>\u00a0in my image I DL it  \n16:38\u00a0<zwindler>\u00a0but in your image I just see a COPY statement  \n16:39\u00a0<zwindler>\u00a0BTW my image might not work because I just commited to get 9.1 but didn't test it ;-)  \n16:39\u00a0<zwindler>\u00a0but 2 days ago, it was working with xwiki 9.0  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see I'm getting version 9.2  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm now testing wisth posgtresql:9.2  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same error....  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi this is what I get now: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/df81f333d2e55b8623ce386f906d587c/raw/ffe97d427587df59948820a712828ad58df0d8c3/gistfile1.txt  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then it seems to work fine  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you get the same?  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FYI in my image I install the jdbc driver with apt-get  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"libpostgresql-jdbc-java\"  \n16:48\u00a0<zwindler>\u00a0yes I see now  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I just need to figure out how to remove the few errors at startup and I'm good  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe there's a problem with xwiki's hbm file for pgsql...  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you have it too?
