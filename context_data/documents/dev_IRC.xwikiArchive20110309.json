Editing most anything in /etc/ requires you to be root.  \n00:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0thought so...  \n00:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0is now known as <rooted>  \n00:59\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hrhrhrhr  \n00:59\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, i'll be going to sweet slumber now... got trouble keeping my eyes open, already  \n00:59\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0good night, see you tomorrow  \n01:00\u00a0<+rooted>\u00a0k.

The \"problem\" is that the artifact name is xwiki-core-parent which is what maven release plugin suggests  \n19:32\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so when I released M1 I justs pressed enter (keeping the default name for the tag)  \n19:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0default=suggested name  \n19:50\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:06\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n20:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:52\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n21:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0guys, do you know why administration app depends on xwiki-core-parent pom? i.e. dependency type is pom and scope is runtime. I know dependency of type pom makes sense inside dependencyManagement when scope is import.  \n22:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: yep I think I know  \n22:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was to signify a dep on core  \n22:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure it's the best way to do it though  \n22:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see, a comment is required then  \n22:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is important for ex when we'll have teh extension manager  \n22:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order to check if the installed core is compatible  \n22:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when installing the extension  \n22:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I understand  \n22:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0right now version is 3.0-milestone-1. I'll leave it like this, but think it should be changed to 3.0 when final is released  \n22:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should be a range  \n22:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0minimal version required  \n22:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think  \n22:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes if minimal is 3.0 (ie not 2.x) then setting to 3.0 is probably better than milestone  \n22:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but the question was more if we use milestones in the range or just final versions  \n22:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n22:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd say final is better indeed  \n22:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even if less precise  \n22:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0sburjan`: Available?  \n22:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:53\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvelociter: are you still working on http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XAANNOTATIONS-43 ?  \n23:08\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0mflorea: no, closing  \n23:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, great  \n23:08\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0I have a tendency to forget to close issues :)  \n23:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n23:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jvelociter: what about http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XASEARCH-22 :)  \n23:15\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0same  \n23:15\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0close  \n23:15\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0closed  \n23:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n\n"}
