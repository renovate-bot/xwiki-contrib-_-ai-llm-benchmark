Please have a look at http://markmail.org/thread/phps4k7zdgyufnzy and let me know what exactly you were suggesting to do in order to avoid PR checks and \"trap-documents\"  \n16:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I am currently facing this issue when trying to implement http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11416 and I need to remove the PR check in the wiki script service to be able to edit wiki descriptors in a subwiki.  \n16:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Enygma`: \u00a0sorry, I have been away a bit, but now having a look  \n16:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: any idea why we have these DB errors in the test logs about integrity constraint violations on XWIKIRCS ?  \n16:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-wysiwyg/lastBuild/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-wysiwyg/testReport/org.xwiki.test.wysiwyg/RegularUserTest/testWikiLinkSearchedPageHidesTechnicalSpaces/ (scroll at the bottom)  \n16:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ve seen a lot of these in the recent tests and they might be impacting the tests themselves  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't recall seeing that  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea what is causing it  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess it means we're trying to save some data in the DB with the same id than existing data  \n17:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Enygma`: seems I only thought about that PR checks in the context of the Activity Stream, where all you can do is read data ... in case of write actions the \u00a0custom checks in services do not help against these trap pages, however. (They would not help against \"trap pages\" in the activity stream either, but all a malicious user can do is add lots of activity streams on one page and make that page very slow ... so I did not worry about that, but I guess I shou  \n17:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so that is why I have not answered to the mail, I am still trying to find a solution for an aspect of the problem I did not understand before  \n17:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0:/ I don`t really see what we could do without signed scripts  \n17:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I am not even sure if signed scripts will solve all the problems ... they would be responsible e.g. for handling CSRF, too, either.  \n17:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0didn't even know about sdoc, btw ...  \n17:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gtg, we`ll talk next week or on the mail thread  \n17:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0have a nice weekend  \n17:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: question regarding styling. Are we allowing to have several forms on a single admin ui page (ie. in a single section). Note that this means having several \"Save\" buttons to save each part  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the idea is that for email, I have 2 config classes for now (with a third one in the future)  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and right now I'm displaying them on the same admin ui page  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess the correct answer is that we should have a new section in the admin and several config pages. The problem is that this is not supported right now\u2026  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with Configurable class)  \n18:16\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: technically there's no problem to have more forms on the same section, each with its own save button. Best is to use JavaScript to save otherwise you may loose changes from form 1 when saving form 2.  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean I should have only 1 save button?  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(mflorea)  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that makes it a lot more complex :)  \n18:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you can have more, but each should save the form without reloading the page, i.e. without \u00a0loosing changes from field of other forms  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok so still using the saveandcontinue action  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it also means notifications to the user that it's saved  \n18:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if you reload the page then only the info from the form that contains the save button is submitted  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I see is that our code is not really meant for this use case  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've had to modify AdminFieldsDisplaySheet for example  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it didn't support several forms on the same pag  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*page  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is why I was asking about best practice  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it feels like this is not part of our best practice to have several forms on the same page  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that instead we're usually creating several sections  \n18:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, it's not common, I haven't seen this done in XWiki before, but technically it's possible  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's something slightly similar though on the Search admin ui  \n18:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, you can \"hide\" this by using some tabs  \n18:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0each form in a tab  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed, that's another idea but again not part of our \"xwiki style guide\" I guess  \n18:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but still you need to use save&continue  \n18:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I was hesitating with looking into supporting sections in configurableclass, ATM I don't know how easy it is though  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll check this out since it's probably the best solution  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if not too complex I'll do it  \n18:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0good luck :)  \n18:34\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0is now known as <momomomomo>  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:58\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:58\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:58\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0is now known as <momomomomo>  \n20:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:04\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:33\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:52\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n22:39\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:56\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
