The CKEditor code is written and documented very well.  \n15:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0now i screwed up my prod system  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not for you Trefex ;))  \n15:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: i guessed so :D  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that said 8.0M1 should be pretty stable IMO  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: if you get milestone in stable repository it's definitely a bug yes  \n15:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/stable/Packages  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0will check it  \n15:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: can i go straight from 7.3 to 8?  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a08.0M1 is not very different from 7.4.1  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very similar  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0upgrading from 7.3 to 8 is not an issue yes, but yes milestone have nothing to do in this repository  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we ahven't done any big change yet in 8.0  \n15:06\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0vmassol: i see  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the major change that will happen in 8.0M2 is probabmy the need for java 8  \n15:06\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0but if you remove now the package from the stable repo, then it will screw up my apt again i guess  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but 8.0M1 just required java 7  \n15:06\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so i guess i can roll back and upgrade to 7.4.1 ?  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I recently changed the filter for stable version, I must have broke something  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt apt-get will upgrade you install with an older package  \n15:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so removing 8.0M1 from the repository should not change anything for you  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: btw would be good to start again the BFDs, no?
