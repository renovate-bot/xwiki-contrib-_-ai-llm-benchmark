Seems like jQuery and Prototype aren't loaded properly. Above the top bar are remains of Javascript. And the main panel shows an alert \"Error number 4001 in 4: Error while evaluating velocity template hierarchy.vm\"  \n13:04\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Actually I wanted to migrate from 7.x to 8.3 and failed. But I expected at least a fresh installation to work. Strange.  \n13:07\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0I'm seeing Tomcat errors\u2026 WARNING: Problem with directory [/usr/share/tomcat8/common/classes], exists: [false], isDirectory: [false], canRead: [false]  \n13:10\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n13:20\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n13:26\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0I'll purge it all and start with Jetty and the WAR file then\u2026  \n13:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n13:50\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Manual installation\u2026 works\u2026 Bummer. I'd love to have used the comfort of the deb package.  \n13:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Signum: 8.3 install from debian package work well for me  \n14:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which package did you installed excatly ?  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe you had some customization in Tomcat setup  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I never got the warning you pasted  \n14:18\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0tmortagne: Weird. I installed xwiki-enterprise-tomcat8-pgsql. Fresh Debian Jessie. Just got Oracle Java 8 from Ubuntu. No Tomcat changes. Just raised the JVM memory from 128 MB to 3 GB.  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I installed xwiki-enterprise-tomcat8-mysql recently  \n14:19\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0I had to purge openjdk7 manually and set JAVA\\_HOME in /etc/default/tomcat8  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think the issue is Java since otherwise Tomcat would not even start  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but maybe it's some right issue  \n14:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anything in the log ?  \n14:20\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0That was the problem at first. Tomcat complained about Java version issues.  \n14:20\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0So I purged openjdk.  \n14:20\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Logs\u2026 well\u2026 nothing useful in my opinion.  \n14:20\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Except for the Java exceptions I quoted.  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this one is just a summary, would need th complete error  \n14:21\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0So the difference is MySQL versus PgSQL so far. I'll make a snapshot of the VM and try again.  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt the issue is the database if your problem are with js libraries as you said  \n14:21\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Do you also use Jessie and Oracle Java 8?  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have one install on Ubuntu 16.10 and another on 14.04  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but Jessie should be fine too  \n14:22\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Should be similar, yes. I'm redoing it now\u2026  \n14:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you could get the complete error you pasted that would probably help understand  \n14:41\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0Installation done.

Your admin aura worked, tmortagne  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Signum: :)  \n14:50\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0tmortagne: How would you get 7.x content back in? Export/Import doesn't seem to work over versions. Just taking the database dump and permanent data directory from the previous version and running the distribution wizard again?  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0export/import XAR (if that's what you are talking about) works well over versions or you have a bug but XAR does not contain everything so I usually go trough mysqldump (or whatever postgre provide in your case) and let XWiki update what need to be update automatically  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0plus the permanent dir of course  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. setup the new server as if there was a XWiki 7.x on it  \n14:53\u00a0\\*\u00a0Signum tries that  \n15:21\u00a0<Signum>\u00a0tmortagne: Well, it seemed to have worked. The wikis' dashboards and sidebars have been overwritten unfortunately.

No extension required (or maybe I miss something)  \n16:30\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0it is not available by default unless you install flavor application  \n16:31\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0it seems that this feature is bundled in Dashboard Application  \n16:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, sorry, I only checked in the preconfigured jetty-hsql install, where this is bundled by default  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0barretto: I think it's Panels.DocumentInformation page in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-panels-ui extension  \n16:47\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:54\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0hello ClemensR  \n16:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hi lucaa  \n16:55\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I had a question about the Mocca Calendar application this morning  \n16:55\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I was wondering if there is any particular reason for whcih the title of the calendars are in a string property and not as computed fields using the title of the document...  \n16:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0(calendars, not events)  \n16:56\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think this can be explained as \u00a0\"historically\"  \n16:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0ok, so just \"legacy\", no other reason that I didn't see  \n16:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0we had not the \"computed field\" zen to do it that way then back  \n16:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0cool, so it could be changed provided that existing data is not too broken :)  \n16:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0it is done for some elements of the application, e.g. event class  \n16:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0but I guess it just was not done for this one  \n16:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, I think so. I might have to check if I have overlooked something obvious  \n16:58\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0also, another question about handling the calendars  \n16:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but I guess we just goofed up on that  \n16:58\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0the display of a calendar is somewhat atypical  \n16:58\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0as in  \n16:58\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0the call to the calendar macro is in the content of the calendar page  \n16:58\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0which is then displayed on the screen with a computed field  \n16:58\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I would have put the call to the macro calendar in the sheet of the calendar  \n16:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0and use the content of the calendar document for a description of the calendar or something  \n16:59\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0the same question, is there any reason for this approach? a benefit somewhere in a functionality that I don't see?  \n17:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0good question. I have to check why it is that case. need a moment, manager with customer worries on the other line :-/  \n17:00\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0sure, it's not urgent  \n17:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0I already customized it for my project (and it works for my usecases) I just want to know if I could eventually bring these changes in the app itself  \n17:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0thanks  \n17:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0lucaa: having the calendar macro as default in the content section instead of the sheet has the advantage that people can copy the page and adapt the calendar view to their needs - or so we initially thought.  \n17:10\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it was another choice that is probably not the best one in hindsight  \n17:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0ok, I see  \n17:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0we never changed it becasue we did not see a good migration path for the existing calendars  \n17:11\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0short question: is it possible to edit the 'default' page template? to add terminal page option on default  \n17:11\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0so the idea is that users can edit that calendar and manipulate the macro call from the content, from the wysiwyg  \n17:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, probably a bad idea to start with ....  \n17:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0it's not such a bad idea, it's a feature that can come in handy  \n17:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0it's just atypical  \n17:12\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0: the \"default\" page template is not a page that exists somewhere, that is why it is always empty  \n17:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0and, imo, is wasting a bit the content of the calendar, which could be used for actual calendar \\_data\\_  \n17:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0but the existence of this data depends on the usage of the app  \n17:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0ok, thanks for the info, ClemensR  \n17:13\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0ClemensR: so is it possible to disable it?  \n17:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0: \u00a0not that I know, unfortunately  \n17:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0ClemensR: ok ty i will find a workaround then  \n17:14\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0: for the previous question , as far as I know, you cannot change the default value of the \"terminal\" option. It's actually, by default, unchecked and non-modifiable for all templates, unless you're advanced user. So you could consider that it's not even a feature, that everything is non-terminal  \n17:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0has quit  \n17:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0lucaa: actually \u00a0currently there is nothing meaningful left to customize for the user in the calendar, all they can do is break it e.g. by changing the scope of the macro to display all events, not only the ones for the current calendar  \n17:17\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0default display of the calendar? :)  \n17:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so it turned out to be kinda pointless  \n17:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and users might easily break it indeed instead e.g. by removing the calendar macro at all by accident  \n17:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0ClemensR: I did these changes for a project, I will see if I find the time to integrate them in the app, to simplify a bit all this. Migration of existing calendars / data will be an important problem, though, as usual :)  \n17:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, that is also a problem to be solved to get the mocca calendar work with nested pages ...  \n17:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think there is a event fired when installing new version, but I never investigated this due to lack of time  \n17:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: so my screenshot in http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/Data/XWiki/8.4RC1/#HXWikiSelectWidgetcanbefiltered is not displayed because it's a \"developer\" change?  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: sorry was in meetings all day, just back now  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you're right  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's it  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could change it though  \n18:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0in any case, I've made a screenshot :)  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR the \"if\" is here: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-releasenotes/blob/17b0e406c4cba5c179c13d7094d9bf06748d976d/application-releasenotes-ui/src/main/resources/ReleaseNotes/Code/ChangesDisplayerSimple.xml#L55-L55  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember why I did this :)  \n18:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0good evening  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could change it but first we need to modify #displayScreenshot  \n18:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0actually no, good bye, see you  \n18:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0:)  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: good evening  \n18:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0oh we can use it to say good bye ?  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think so :)  \n18:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0nice :)  \n18:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<barretto>\u00a0has quit  \n19:35\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:46\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:04\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:06\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n23:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit\n"}
