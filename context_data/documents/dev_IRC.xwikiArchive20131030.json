I wanted to ask you if you intend to rename the workspacetemplate into something more better, since we dropped the notion of workspace now.  \n14:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0sburjan: yes, in the new UI I am making, there is no \"Workspace\" in the document names anymore  \n14:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I am talking about the database or in the schema name from the DB  \n14:58\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0AMT we have workspacetemplate and templatee, which are very inconsistent one with each other  \n14:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but I don't have renamed the existing translation keys, which are still called \"workspaces.something\"  \n14:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0oh yes sorry  \n14:59\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0in the future, we won't need a template anymore  \n14:59\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so there is no name to change ;)  \n14:59\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I hope you will be able to test if when 5.3M2 will be released!  \n14:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, that's cool  \n14:59\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0-if+it  \n14:59\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I hope that too :)  \n15:00\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0btw, do you know in which page the descriptor of a wiki is found ?
