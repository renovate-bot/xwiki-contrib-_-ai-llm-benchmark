I think I'll finally start to move wysiwyg tests to selenium 2, but in xwiki-platform-wysiwyg/xwiki-platform-wysiwyg-test (-pageobjects/tests). We may need to create a separate job for platform ui tests though  \n09:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, let's see the tests now  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lot of work indeed, but doing it slowly one by one should be ok  \n09:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: why not use test.xwiki.org? :)  \n09:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: you're right and I'm going to start using the new wiki. but now I tested a certain jira issue and I don't think we have a test just for it  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why you should use it to create new tests!  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's its purpose :)  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should be easy to add new tests on test.xwiki.org  \n10:00\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: is that vise ?  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's not then it's failing  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0vise?  \n10:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0wise  \n10:00\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0\\*wise  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why not?  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's its purpose  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to be able to add lots of tests and report their execution on given versions  \n10:01\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0we'll end up with thousand of tests if we add a test for each issue we have  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr?  \n10:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I don't know if we should create tests for any specific jira issue...  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0explain to me why hiding a test that you do makes it better?  \n10:01\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0exactly  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you run a test it \\*MUST\\* be on test.xwiki.org  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any test  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise it doesn't exist and doesn't cout  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0count  \n10:01\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0because if we add it, it will \\_always\\_ show\\_ up, meaning we will have to test it on each future release ?  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if test.xwiki.org is only for tests that exists on all versions of XE then you're going to have a big problem  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we add or remove features  \n10:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0or maybe we could add a test for each jira, but mark it in some way to know not to test it again for each release  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you need to do  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on test.xwiki.org  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is be able to mark a test as valid only for a given version  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or a range of versions  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or a starting version  \n10:03\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0:(  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually 2 fields  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0starting version  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0end version  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that allows new features to not appear for old versions  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and allow for removal of feature  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like tagcloud plugin for ex  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which was removed not that long ago  \n10:04\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0you should have given us this feedback when we requested it :(  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: that's a pretty stupid comment sorry  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should stop doing it if you believe in up front design  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/it/IT  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's been 20 years that only fool believe in up front design anymore :)  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I'm exagerating a little, only 15 years  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is why I've been telling you  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to release this app for one full year  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you kept it way too long in the closet  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's only one way to know requirement  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is by using the app  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and iterate  \n10:06\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0well yes, but what you are proposing now is a model change. How should I handle this ? go back in dev mode, wait 2 more months ?  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and let me tell you a secret  \n10:06\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0tell me  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this app is going to change a lot in the future too  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gasp!!!  \n10:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0:)  \n10:07\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: yes, I can see that :) My big fear is how are we going to address backward compatibility, or the data the application already created ?  \n10:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0we knew that, we just didn't think the change would come so fast after the release  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is a very very very very minor change  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that takes about 1 hour to do  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should be fine if you agree with it  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll live  \n10:08\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0ok. let's do it your way. But if I'll need help I hope you can help :)  \n10:08\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I'd propose we start using the app for now, on how it is  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I'm propsing  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that we record all our tests on test.xwiki.org  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK that was your proposal too  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just forgot about those tests  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now you jsut need to find a way to take them into account  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pretty simple  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not using test.xwiki.org would be a major failure  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it means that it's more complex to use test.xwiki.org than doing it in a plain page  \n10:10\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: i get your point. but the app was created having in mind only the repetitive tests which have to be done on each release  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which would question the need for test.xwiki.org  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no such thing as repetitvie tests  \n10:10\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I'll have to think of a way  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I told you features come and go  \n10:10\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0yes, but annootations, comments won't go that soon  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you add new tests  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that have not been executed on old versions  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah annotations is a good one  \n10:11\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0yepp, that will happen  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it has changed drastically  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's been merged with comments  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the tests for annoations  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are completely different in old versions and in new versions  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're different tests thus  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the old tests should be done on the new versions  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since now they are comments  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're just proving my point thanks :)  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*should be/shoud not be  \n10:12\u00a0<npm\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0ok, I'll have to think of a way to mark a test as active/inactive and introduce a range of versions  \n10:14\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0but can we start using the app FTM ?  \n10:14\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0see how it goes, maybe you'll have even more feedback after we start using it  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure I keep telling you to use the app ASAP  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you're not doing it :(  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've said that at least 3-4 times  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don'tknow how to say it differently  \n10:17\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0you don't have. when you propose a change I always have the idea that the change must be done \\_before\\_ start using the app  \n10:17\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0so I feel like back to square 0  \n10:17\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I've never done iterative dev, this is new for me and I lack knowledge on practices  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that this is your work and you manage it the way you want, I'm just trying to push you to get some results and so that you can improve :)  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0arr, tmortagne broke the build and I was about to release  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just now?
