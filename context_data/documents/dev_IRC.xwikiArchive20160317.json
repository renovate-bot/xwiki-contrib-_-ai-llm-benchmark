Meanwhile I skip short URLs and see if it is working without.  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thx  \n18:25\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:35\u00a0<helge>\u00a0vmassol: ok, found that you can not omit \"Main\" or search will break  \n18:35\u00a0<helge>\u00a0xwiki.usedefaultweb=0  \n18:35\u00a0<helge>\u00a0must not be xwiki.usedefaultweb=1 in xwiki.cfg  \n18:36\u00a0<helge>\u00a0So now I get the search page, but ...  \n18:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:36\u00a0<helge>\u00a0the velocity macro won't work  \n18:36\u00a0<helge>\u00a0Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The resolver parameter doesn't contain an Entity Reference of type [SPACE]  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"must not be xwiki.usedefaultweb=1 in xwiki.cfg\" that's a bug, you shoud erport it  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*report  \n18:37\u00a0<helge>\u00a0I will do in a minute  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re the velocity macro issue I don't have enough details to understan the problem  \n18:39\u00a0<helge>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/S0qZVvH9  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think ir means that the reference passed to the resolver is not correct  \n18:42\u00a0<helge>\u00a0can I do something about it?  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's probably due to some other config  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would need to debug the call to #handleSolrSearchRequest  \n18:43\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably a call to $services.solr.resolve()  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so printing the the passed argument should \u00a0help  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's not very easy for you to do  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I guess adding this to the issue should be good enough  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you need to provide all config options you 've used  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that we can reproduce  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what you can do  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is unset some config options you're using related to URLs  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or rewrite)  \n18:53\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:53\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<helge>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n20:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n20:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:47\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n20:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:34\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:01\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:03\u00a0<mrvis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:18\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n23:23\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
