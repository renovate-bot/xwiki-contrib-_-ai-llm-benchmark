Thank's for the great work. :-)  \n13:13\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:13\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0I'm trying to configure ldap support, (i.e. ldaps)  \n13:13\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n13:13\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0I configured it in wiki.cfg set the ip and a port (it's an AD with port 636)  \n13:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0the port ist reachable.  \n13:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0but every time I try to login I see with tcpdump that it only connects to port 389  \n13:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0any ideas why?  \n13:15\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0I'm using the debian packages from maven.xwiki.org  \n13:16\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0is there some kind of cache which should be deleted?  \n13:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7: no there is no cache for this and setting the port is supposed to work  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you just modified the existing xwiki.authentication.ldap.port in xwiki.cfg ?  \n13:28\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0yes  \n13:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha but wait you modified it after starting XWiki ?  \n13:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not exactly a cache from LDAP point of view but xwiki.cfg is loaded at startup only  \n13:29\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0tmortagne: I tried to restart tomcat after each modification to xwiki.cfg  \n13:29\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0I just looked up in the database and found ldap\\_port in xwikistrings table with the wrong portnumber settings  \n13:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did you try setting it from the UI at some point ?  \n13:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this field is empty by default AFAIK  \n13:30\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0rmortagne, that may be a reason. A collegue tried to install the ldap extension to modify it directly in the webinterface  \n13:30\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0as far as I can tell, the extension is already deleted  \n13:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep the LDAP extension is putting the settings in the wiki  \n13:31\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0but there maybe some old stuff like the database entries?  \n13:31\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0Is there a way, to delete all entries created by the ldap-extension?  \n13:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the extension is just UI to manipulate what already exist in standard, everything is stored in http://myhost/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object  \n13:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0search for LDAP fieldd and empty everything  \n13:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fields  \n13:36\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0tmortagne: Sorry, I'm new to xwiki, and the URL you posted points me to a page where I see 3 different \"Objects\". ClassSheetBinding(1),XWikiGlobalRights(3) and XWikiPreferences(1)  \n13:37\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0tmortagne: there seems to be no ldap entries.  \n13:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right I forgot, it's in XWikiPreferences object  \n13:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0click on XWikiPreferences  \n13:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it will expand  \n13:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the object containing most of the configuration at wiki level (it used to contain all the configuration at wiki level but we are trying to move stuff in dedicated places now)  \n13:50\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0tmortagne: thank you very much. :-)  \n13:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you're welcome  \n13:51\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0tmortagne: after deleting every ldap entry and setting \"ldap\"-option to \"none\" it worked.  \n13:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7: in case you did not already saw it the following link would be interesting for you: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/LDAPAuthenticationUseCases  \n13:57\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0Hm, I stumbled upon the next problem.  \n13:57\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0I got my configuration settings about ldap from this page:  \n13:57\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-865  \n13:58\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0and saw the description about placing the keystore into a specific directory.  \n13:59\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n14:00\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0regardless of the setting in xwiki.cfg: xwiki.authentication.ldap.ssl.keystore  \n14:03\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7: not a SSL expert but looks like https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19148-01/819-4467/aeoqa/index.html is related to what you are searching  \n14:06\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:08\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:35\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0tmortagne: I meant, that there is an option in the xwiki.cfg (xwiki.authentication.ldap.ssl.keystore), but it looks like it not used by the ssl.secure\\_provider  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7: as far as I understand the provide is looking at javax.net.ssl.trustStore system property and the LDAP authenticator is setting javax.net.ssl.trustStore system property to what is in xwiki.authentication.ldap.ssl.keystore  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but yes you could directly set \u00a0javax.net.ssl.trustStore , probably make more sense f you have other things to set  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword which is not set by the authenticator, that option should probably be removed from xwiki.cfg and replaced by some documentation about javax.net.ssl  \n14:39\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0tmortagne, yes that would be nice. :-)  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7: if you make all that work a suggestion of what to put in xwiki.cfg would be great ;)  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(I never used SSL with LAP myself)  \n14:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*LDAP  \n15:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:42\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0thank all of you for the great work and support. :-)  \n16:03\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_7>\u00a0has quit  \n16:55\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:24\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note: all the failing test on ci are probably my fault, I'm on it  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok :)  \n17:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it's fixed, will be committed as soon as oldcore build properly)  \n18:05\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:24\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:00\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n21:25\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:26\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:22\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n23:09\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit\n"}
