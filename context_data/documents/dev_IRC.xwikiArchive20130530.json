So when you click on the upgrade it \\_schedules\\_ the job (the job is put in a queue), but the job will be executed when the job manager is free  \n12:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0ok, so, this is essentially a feedback issue then ?  \n12:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0It have opened the details, but I was not aware something has been queued  \n12:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't know what you mean by \"t does not really do anything useful\"  \n12:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I just saw the description tab  \n12:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you should see the progress bar at 0%  \n12:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0not at all, no plan has been established  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:05\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I was at the first step, clicking update, not after the click on continue  \n12:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the extension details were hidden when you clicked upgrade?  \n12:05\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yes, and it open on description tab  \n12:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and nothing else happen  \n12:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0when the UI has finished, I clicked again on the update button  \n12:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, would have been good to know if the progress bar was displayed after a page refresh  \n12:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I will try that next time and be more careful  \n12:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but normally, if no error occurs, the job is scheduler and the extension is redisplayed, and it's status should be loading, thus with progress bar. If the progress bar was missing I assume that either the job wasn't scheduler for some reason, or it was scheduled, but the extension was displayed before the job status was set to pending.  \n12:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0s/scheduler/scheduled  \n12:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0reloading the page would have proven if the second option was true (job state set to pending after the extension was displayed)  \n12:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0ok, be sure I will check next time, and I will let you know  \n12:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I assume there were no related exceptions in the log right?  \n12:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I mean, something saying that a job couldn't be scheduled or run  \n12:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0most probably it's a synchronization issue between the extension display and the job status update  \n12:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: I do not see anything in the log directly related, but btw, I have other job schedule issue (with PR right) that are in the log, but without a properly format, mainly no date, which make these log not really helpful  \n12:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0maybe totally unrelated, seems to be jobs of the scheduler  \n12:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the job manager and the job scheduler are different  \n12:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yes I know  \n12:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the message are not really clear  \n12:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0at least nothing about the DW  \n12:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0anyway, I'll try to check when exactly the job status is set and if it's possible that the extension is displayed before.  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:36\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:44\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: hello.
