He just added two methods leaving everything else the same  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if clirr says it is, then it is  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it methods added to an interface?  \n16:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems so  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it definitely is a breakage  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0imagine someone coded an implementation  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then he upgrades to the new version of xwiki  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0his code will fail  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can imagine an extension on xwiki.org if you rpefer  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when you try to install it on xwiki 4.3M1 it suddenly deosn't work anymore  \n16:49\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0oh right, it was an interface indeed  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depending on the definityion of \"young api'\" workspaces api could be considered as such or not  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ATM our best answer is:  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a VOTE with committers deciding whether to break or not  \n16:50\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol, fmancinelli: the exclude was added by GuillaumeD`s pull request. It allows for having multiple workspace templates. I agree that I should have changed the comment to a more meaningfull one and maybe that there should have been a mail about it, but I assure you that it is a needed feature.  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's always needed feature that's not the issue  \n16:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but I also assure you that there is no other implementation that is affected by this :)  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue is that we globally agree to break an api for a better good  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/api/people/  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0in this case I think it would be a nobrainer but since it's a serious offense to break an api it's betetr to get an agreement  \n16:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I know this might be good, but isn`t it also slowing progress?  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nobrainer = it's a relatively recent api that not a lof users must be implemeting  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0!!!!  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we've \u00a0been slowing xwiki progress for 6 years now  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by deciding to evolve xwiki rather than to rerite it  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rewrite  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was an important decision at the time  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the consequence is speed of dev ofc  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the pros is that people can build apps in prod on top of xwiki  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we all want is JDK8 to be here :)  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it allows adding default methods for interfaces  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(aka defender methods)  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.javabeat.net/2012/05/virtual-extension-methods-in-java-8/)  \n16:56\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0Enygma`, I've just pushed the changes... This is the line to fix: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/pom.xml#L339  \n16:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so, according to this logic, once a feature is bundled in an XWiki release and it is no longer in the new Roadmap, development of that feature stops completely. Only bugfixes that don`t affect the existing API are accepted and, on a case-by-case manner, some API brakages are accepted for bugfixes/improvements.  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"development of that feature stops completely.\" not necesarily  \n16:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah, and new API (new interfaces/services)  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are lots of ways to add features without breakinfg backward compat  \n16:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but if you had design problems with your initial implementation or you just did not have the time to implement essential features, you will be screwed, and will have to always send mails about it  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hence the notion of \"young apis\"  \n16:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes when it's out of being \"young\"  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then if you made a design issue you're screwed  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check the JDK for example of screw ups  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the way to get out of screw ups is to do what we've done for rendering  \n17:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0what you say fits more with feature-boxing rather than time-boxing  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie rewrite it in another namespace  \n17:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it`s just not realistic IMO for time-boxing  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and deprecated the old one  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me that's completely unrelated  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't even think of a common point  \n17:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0what I meant was that when you have a time limit, your design will also need to be limited to be able to implement it.  \n17:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but anyway, I agree that refactoring at some point is the answer  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first you need to realize we're talking about apis here not features  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the end user it has no impact  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the good practice is to make somehow the api as young (internal package ATM is all we really have for that)  \n17:03\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0I suppose that I should move to 4.3-M2 all the open JIRAs that are marked as fix 4.3-M1  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fmancinelli: yes but please check that there are been no commits  \n17:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right, so you will end up with an API that is as expressive as possible, but not all methods will be implemented because you did not have the time for them. But you will implement them eventually  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(commits tab)  \n17:03\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ok  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sometimes devs forget to close issues  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: YAGNI principle  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0aka overdesign  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the answer is indeed refactoring  \n17:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0agreed, but then you have backwards compatibility  \n17:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0:)  \n17:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only if you put them publicly available for users to write against  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hence the reason we have internal packages for ex  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this means: don't touch this, it can change anytime, we don't gurantee backward compat  \n17:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, so indeed the internal APIs solution does seem good... even if you might have some devs not able to use your APIs untill you decide to \"publish\" them  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's better to code defensively  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which means close api and then open when user ask for it  \n17:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so people really needing them will use them and then refactor when they become public... but you will end up with a fake solution, since people will \\*need to\\* refactor anyway :)  \n17:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but at least you can say that it`s their fault :)))  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can tell them \"I told ya!\" ;)  \n17:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I call that cheating, but anyway :)  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it's visible  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a contract  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if 100% of your software is internal  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it just mean you're not a dev platform  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's all  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no cheating  \n17:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I would have settled with a warning on the public API that it`s young, instead of the whole internal sharade  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: the thred has not been closed  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we are currently undecided  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://markmail.org/thread/hzhoncujzn37k7qh  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only rule we have now  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that any CLIRR exclude must require a VOTE  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this has been voted and is documented  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DevelopmentPractices#HBackwardCompatibility  \n17:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, I know  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"We never remove APIs from the legacy modules by default.
