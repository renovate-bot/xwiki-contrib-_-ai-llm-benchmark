I see that in our 5.2RC1 we have 2 versions of jdom jar: \u00a0jdom2-2.0.5.jar and jdom-1.1.3.jar. Is this intended/known/normal ?  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: those are completely different  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we have two version of commons-lang too ;)  \n15:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as you can see they don't have the same id  \n15:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:54\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:45\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:48\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0Hey all. I'm having a rights issue in 5.1... My blog space is set to allow XWikiAllGroup to view/comment... The XWiki global rights are set to allow XWikiAllGroup view/comment, and I have turned off the \"Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page or space rights\" option. Still, unauthenticated users get a login page trying to view the blog... Thoughts?  \n16:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0D-Spair: XWikiAllGroup groups means the users of the wiki so when you give view rights to this group to implicitly remove that right to anyone else  \n16:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you need to give view right to unauthenticated users in your blog space  \n16:50\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0Oh? So I should \"clear\" those checkboxes and it should resolve it?  \n16:51\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0How do I give view/comment rights to unregistered users?  \n16:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0D-Spair: basically when you set an right you kill inheritance  \n16:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you might want to look at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Access+Rights  \n16:53\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0Thanks for the assistance... It might be more intuitive to create a virtual \"Unauthenticated Users\" group which you could use to explicitly assign rights...  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0D-Spair: you have one  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's in users  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not groups  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's why I said \"you need to give view right to unauthenticated users in your blog space\" ;)  \n16:54\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0Now I see it!  \n16:54\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0Thank you!  \n16:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0np it might be easier if that entity was in groups instead of users I don't know  \n17:14\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:58\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:22\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:24\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:47\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:41\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:01\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:08\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:11\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:11\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n22:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:49\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:33\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n23:39\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:42\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:42\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n23:51\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:51\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
