If I donwload the XEM with mySQL zip, I baiscally get the default XE Platform + the specific jar's. When I import it, the default (blank) wiki tell me I have to download XE. My question is if that the platform is aware as being XEM capable or not. Because we have that, I'd suggest adding link to the XEM xar instead of the XE XAR  \n14:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0otherwise, the user will be confused and might get an XE instead of XEM  \n14:58\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0that might be a good idea  \n14:59\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but a simple $xwiki.isVirtualMode() is not enough... we might need a marker in the XEM distribution to be 100% it's the right distribution  \n14:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes.. I don't know if we have that  \n14:59\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0not very familiar with XEM  \n15:00\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I think one solution would be to include an extra vm file in the XEM distribution that outputs a string.. like \"XEM\"  \n15:00\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and in XE, just check for it  \n15:00\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but this is not nice, scratch that :)  \n15:01\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0anyway, 1st step: make an issue with this so we don`t forget about it  \n15:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes. I know there is an API method to get the version, but I don't know if that takes the version from the imported XAR or from the platform  \n15:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0anyway, I'll create the improvement issue  \n15:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I have a question.
