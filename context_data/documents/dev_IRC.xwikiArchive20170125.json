Do you have a way to insert it?  \n15:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: I let you correct my little summary in the release notes :)  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: so you already know that you've made mistakes? :)  \n15:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I think this summary is a bit special  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I'm curious  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems you cheated  \n15:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0why?  \n15:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0We have decided not to dupplicate changes done on 8.4.x  \n15:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but then the JIRA dashboards show them  \n15:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so I had to find a way to explain that :  \n15:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0:)  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:37\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"We have decided not to dupplicate changes done on 8.4.x\"  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't agree  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally I mentioned the opposite :)  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm checking somethng  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it olny depends of the since  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we have the 8.4.5 items in the RN for 9.0RC1?  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if so it's fine for now)  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually not even sure we need to mention that it includes stuff done from 8.4.1 to 8.4.4  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it also contains stuff done for 7.x for ex :)  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's ok  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's acceptable as it is even though it doesn't look very sexy :)  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw tmortagne, since you've implemented \u00a0filesystem recycle bin could we turn on FS attachments by default now?  \n16:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@gd: we still need to handle changes both in 8.4.5 and in 9.0RC1  \n16:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0(sorry I'm in a call)  \n16:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I implemented document FS recycle bin and that was not the things missing to enable FS attachment by default  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is still various issues  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. I added a new features, not fixed the issues on other FS stores  \n16:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\o/  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I must have read too quickly and thought you had implemented attachment FS recycle bin  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no the issue was about document containing lots of attachments (i.e. document with a huge XML produced to store)  \n16:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: indeed  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not that it's not all or nothing when talking about FS storage, we could enable some stores and not others  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did not enabled the new document recycle bin yet to be safe for now (i.e. experimental feature) but it does introduce any limitation like the other stores  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the attachment store looks Ok too (but it would require improvement to deal with the transition first)  \n16:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0attachment recycle bin store need to be rethinked (probably on the same model than what I did for document recycle bin like I commented in the issue)  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one issue I know right now is that the AllDocs's attachment tab doesn't work for FS attachments  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes that's what I'm talking about  \n16:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this one is fixable by applying the same logic than what is done for document recycle bin  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is like with attachment to keep metadata in the database and only store the huge value on filesystem  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. introduce an attachment recycle bin CONTENT store that would be used by the hibernate recycle bin store  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0FS store issues are fixable, just need to allocate time  \n16:32\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same thing for the migration issue by the way, the way I implemented document recycle bin content FS store you don't need any migration (automated or not)  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, we need to find some time for this IMO because we've been waiting too long already to default to FS attachment  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm actually ok to move to FS attachments without the AllDocs attachment tab  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I sent a proposal but would need to check again  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the migration issue is too a big issue IMO  \n16:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we need to fix that before moving  \n16:59\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:07\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Note: I broke the HTML functional test on 8.4.x branch, fixing  \n18:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you see, sometime it fail :)  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be fixed now  \n18:23\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:58\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maven/git 9.0-rc-1 release done  \n20:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:24\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n21:46\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:09\u00a0<raphael29\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:40\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n23:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
