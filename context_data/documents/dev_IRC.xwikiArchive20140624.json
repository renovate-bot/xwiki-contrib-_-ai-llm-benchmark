Seems to not work if you try from your watchlist preferences  \n07:56\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0teekay: have you tried removing it manually from the Object Editor on the user's Profile page?  \n08:23\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n08:38\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:30\u00a0<teekay>\u00a0evalica: thanks that worked. looks like i'll have to write a procedure on that one for our users..  \n09:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0teekay: k :)  \n09:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:44\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:58\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:07\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hi, what piece of code is handling adding / modifying objects in app within minutes? (currently, date field ignores user timezone, which is not desirable, especially with applications like calendar)  \n10:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: is there a date field in XWiki with timezone ? I think the common \"Date\" field has not time zone, and it is up to the application to handle this, if wanted ... I have to admit I did not look into that closely  \n10:23\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: that's the problem, there is no date field with timezone, although users have timezone -> if user with different timezone inputs date, the date is saved as if it was in default timezone  \n10:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0aside of that AppWithMinutes created applications are not that special to \"manually\" created ones, you get a \"class sheet\" for every class displaying the instances of the application  \n10:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I am trying to remember how to customize the save action for the edit view ....  \n10:27\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0there is possibility of adding listener to those events (document created/updated \u00a0\u00a0/ \u00a0xobject add/update), but what is the point of having user timezone and using it only for viewing? If user is in different timezone, he won't be thinking of shifting his time to correct timezone (although there could be some notifications)  \n10:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0... ah I confused it with \"Validation\" ... like in http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Creating+a+form+with+validation+and+tooltips \u00a0... its pretty old but still works.  \n10:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0in principle you can add the timezone in the display, and if a user edits an object, then in the save listener you can subtract the tie zone again  \n10:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I have to admit this \"manually housekeeping\" looks annoying ... not sure if there is a better way, though  \n10:32\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, thanks  \n10:37\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0come to think about \u00a0I guess you are maybe better off with a \"DocumentCreatingEvent / DocumentUpdatingEvent\" listener instead of a Validator ... it is possible to \"adjust\" values in a validator, but it a bit odd ... listener like e.g http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Observation+Module+Local#HWritinganEventListenerinGroovyinaWikipage  \n10:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0er, I meant: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingEventListenerTutorial  \n10:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, i know about event listeners, but i still think this functionality should be in core (so every datetime showing / updating will consider user timezone)  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I plan the start the 6.1RC1 release in about half an hour  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok for everyone ?  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: nothing in your todo regarding bug you fixed yesterday ?  \n10:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0tmortagne: k - thanks for notice - nothing on my part  \n10:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0nope, I have checked this morning that all needed unit tests are already written  \n10:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and IE9 works  \n10:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0IE11 is supposed to be very clode to the web standards  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at last :)  \n10:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but ahain we have to do specific hack to make it work...  \n10:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10514  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nice one  \n10:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0:)  \n11:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: you can extend the \u00a0com.xpn.xwiki.objects.classes.DataClass for that, and overwriting the fromString and toFormString \u00a0methods ... like http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/CreatingNewXClassPropertyTypes  \n11:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess the core does not do that because it has no idea from where to get the time zone  \n11:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0patching the existing \u00a0DateClass might be tricky due to b/w compat issues ...  \n11:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(oh, and s/classes.DataClass/classes.DateClass/ of coutre)  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0starting the 6.1RC1 release  \n11:36\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: yes, i looked at that, sadly there isn't any good way how to obtain that timezone  \n11:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, thats the problem ;) \u00a0you could write a @Component, which uses a \u00a0Provider<XWikiContext> contextProvider ... and so on, somewhat similar to the com.xpn.xwiki.internal.localization.XWikiLocalizationContext  \n11:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I am afraid it is not going to be easier that that ...  \n12:24\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ClemensR: well, i guess there  \n12:24\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0is some piece of code between frontend and baseobject calling  \n12:24\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0so it could be done there  \n12:31\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: ah, I did not know that such a thing exists (especially for the \"getter\" ... I guess if a script calls that, it might be tricky to catch it)  \n12:36\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yes.. well, i will try to do it somehow :)  \n12:40\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n13:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n13:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:09\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:29\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n13:38\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:20\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0can we commit now?  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: yes  \n15:54\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0thx  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: don't forget to merge on stable-6.1.x branch  \n15:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yep  \n16:02\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like Freecode is dead  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"Effective 2014-06-18 Freecode is no longer being updated\"  \n16:18\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:41\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:22\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:25\u00a0<vfzevaze>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:20\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Anyone knows what is the issue with the platform build on ci ?  \n18:22\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:22\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:01\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:15\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n20:47\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n21:49\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:57\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n22:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:44\u00a0<moviuro>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:46\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:47\u00a0<moviuro>\u00a0Hi there! XWiki messes up some simple things like, say, code: http://paste.kde.org/p6eleyi0j gives: http://wstaw.org/m/2014/06/24/plasma-desktopQmE669.png : why aren't both code exactly the same thing with header box and so on?  \n23:58\u00a0<moviuro>\u00a0hmmmm, actually, it's even worse: it's just random, sometimes it's messed up, sometimes it isn't...\n"}
