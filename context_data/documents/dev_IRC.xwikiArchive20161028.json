Am I right?  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Pbas: yes the new extension is fully retro compatible so the same parameter will work except for xwiki.authentication.authclass which is different  \n13:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the same authenticator which has been moved plus a few bonuses, not really a rewrite  \n14:00\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Failed to initialize AuthService com.xpn.xwiki.user.impl.LDAP.XWikiLDAPAuthServiceImpl using Reflection, trying default implementations using 'new'.  \n14:00\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I must remove com.xpn.xwiki.user.impl.LDAP.XWikiLDAPAuthServiceImp from xwiki.cfg I suppose  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again you need to change xwiki.authentication.authclass  \n14:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/Authenticator/#HGenericLDAPconfiguration  \n14:02\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ho ty, I will test it  \n14:06\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0(it is strange than authentication is contrib now because to install ldap extension we must authenticate first)  \n14:06\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0it doesn't work i must read better your doc  \n14:10\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0is it ok with this line? http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/Authenticator/#HLogbackconfigurationfile  \n14:11\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0must be <logger name=\"org.xwiki.contrib.ldap\" level=\"trace\"/> instead ?  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Pbas: yes, fixed the package name in the doc (I usually use the UI)  \n14:15\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok I didn't manage to use ldap authentication, but it seem ldap extension is not installed correctly  \n14:16\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I don't see a ldap section in xwikipreference and logs neither  \n14:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Pbas: do you see it in \"installed extensions\" ?  \n14:18\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes installed but if I click on \"display details\" I have velocity error  \n14:18\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I haven't this problem with other extension  \n14:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's weird, try to restart maybe  \n14:19\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0already done!
