Jenkins seems stable enough  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@tmortagne: cool  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: why did you revert the commit for XWIKI-10247 on 5.4.5? Too dangerous somehow?  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: there is no such thing as ContentParser in 5.4 branch it seems so that merge was actually totally broken  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the required change is a big change so yes sounds too dangerous to me  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically what is needed here is XWIKI-10248  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, strange I'd have thought that ContentParser is something old  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: hi, do you think you could look at http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9934?focusedCommentId=80383&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-80383 when you get some time? Just to make sure it's not a real problem that we need to fix quickly.  \n11:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: as I have seen, it is not related to the jira issue  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok but is it still a problem we need to fix?  \n11:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0actually the description is very poor  \n11:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but it seems we have the same problem on http://www.xwiki.com/lang/en/BlogFr/BlogFrTemplate  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: we have at 2 different ContentParser ;)  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a03 not 2  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this DefaultContentParser is a new helper added by denis  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ah ok :)  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but anyway modifying it is not enough to dully support syntax installed as extension, there is other places that still get the syntaxes through Utils  \n11:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: it looks like an error on the velocity code  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau:  \n11:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I mean, at \u00a0least concerning the xwiki.com blof  \n11:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*blog  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so do we need a new jira issue?  \n11:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0probably yes, but the description is not sufficient IMO to create a precise one  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok maybe you could comment then to ask him to create a new issue and explain what addition details he needs to provide?  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gtg for early lunch, bbl  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:32\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:45\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:21\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[ANN] starting the git/maven release for 6.0RC1, hold you commits on master please  \n15:41\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:41\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:51\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: the enforcer rule that is supposed to check if <version> is valid in our build does not seems to work anymore, I fixed one mistake when I released 6.0M2 and I'm fixing another one now  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the LDAP auth dependency in https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/blob/master/xwiki-enterprise-web/pom.xml  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you mean the check for project.version vs commons.version/platform.version, etc?  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I just fixed a project.version to platform.version  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne:  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure it ever existed in enterprise  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can see it defined in platform  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not in enterprise  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in platform: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/10737661/raw/c408ac397c8141d424ecaffc66cbd138474ac79d/gistfile1.txt  \n16:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be simple to add though  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it also exists in rendering btw)  \n16:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I tough it was everywhere, like defined in commons-pom since we need it everywhere  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no because the rules depend on where you are  \n16:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the check is generic and is in \u00a0a java class but the application of it is root-project specific  \n16:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me make the change  \n16:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0thanks  \n16:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0arg macdonald won't let git commands go through...  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0port 22 is closed  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me paste my change  \n16:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can use github https ?
