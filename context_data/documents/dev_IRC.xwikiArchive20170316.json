I stumbled across your GSoC page and after taking a look at your project ideas, I'd be interested in working on the \"translation in context\" project.  \n09:03\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0If I understand correctly, it would be a UI extension to simplify the l10n.xwiki.org translation process?  \n09:04\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:04\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0vmassol: I just downloaded 9 jetty/hsqldb 9.1.2 and when I unsinatll the blog I get the XE main wiki flavor in the uninstall plan  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes me too  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: do you remember the jira issue related to being able to uninstall a extension without uninstzalling the flavor?  \n09:05\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0actually forget that the home page is not in this flavor  \n09:05\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it's in platform flavor  \n09:05\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0I think XE mainwiki flavor is pretty much empty these days  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the issue will be when you uprgade the WAR next time?  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DW won't find the flavor and won't propose to upgrade it?  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or it won't know the current version  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it'll find it in the meatdata  \n09:06\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0I confirm it's totally empty, see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/tree/master/xwiki-enterprise-ui/xwiki-enterprise-ui-mainwiki  \n09:06\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0DW does not work that way  \n09:06\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it does not care about what you have  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmms trange that blog is in th're  \n09:06\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it look at the WAT to know what to install  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0known as \"default extension UI\"  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it won't know the verdsion installaed  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it does not need to  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it won't know the version installed  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it will propose you to install the default UI  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so for blog it'll work  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0and it install it and upgrade the dependencies  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying sandbox now  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the \"repair\" phase is just a migration hack you get when you don't have any extension installed  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the \"repair\" phase is just a migration hack you get when you don't have any extension installed (DW consider you come from a old style world)  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok sandox is a bigger issue  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0removes a lot more since it removes ui common  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you have the jira issue for this?  \n09:09\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0no  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's becoming a blocker now  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with Guillaume's protection  \n09:11\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0Ulydev: yes excatly, the idea is to provide a new way to contribute translations (it also make easier to have custom translation locally even if you don't \"push\" them)  \n09:11\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0vmassol: guillaume protection does not prevent you from deleting extension pages  \n09:11\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it warn you  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0put yourself in a user's shoes  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it says ti recommends to uninstall the exyension  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that's what a user will try to do  \n09:13\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0Nice, I like the idea. There could be some kind of popover when you select text (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VincentLoy/share-selected-text/master/demo/sst.jpg) to make it even easier!  \n09:13\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0I'll look into the code to see how translation currently works :)  \n09:14\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0Ulydev: the idea on gsoc.xwiki.org indicate the technical possibilities but them it's up to the student to propose what you do with it ;)  \n09:15\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0great!  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0this remaind me I need to add something in the description  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0Ulydev: you might be interrested by what I just added  \n09:18\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0(see the notification)  \n09:18\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0Oh, alright, the URL parameter  \n09:19\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0note that translation macro is still not used everywhere (far from it) but supported only that for now is ok in the context of the GSOC  \n09:19\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0this tool will incitate developer to use the macro more :)  \n09:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:49\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0@vmassol: for the doctree perf issue on my 9.1.2 migrated from a 8.4, I confirm thaat updating the pseudo terminal pages as real terminal pages (advanced user moving them and ticking the checkbox) solved the issue. No more perf issue in the tree  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's weird. It probably deserves a jira issue. mflorea1 : are you aware of such as issue?  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not normal that terminal pages would slow down the doc tree  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0faichelbaum: would you mind creating a jira issue for this?  \n09:53\u00a0<Ulydev>\u00a0has quit  \n10:00\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey guys, seems I have a little hard time explaining things to this Patrick Hausen on the list. If you want to chime in on the thread don't hesitate ;)  \n11:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I tested with lots of terminal and non-terminal pages the doc tree performance and there was no problem. faichelbaum must have something else.  \n11:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0as can be seen from http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13468?focusedCommentId=92225&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-92225  \n11:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0#if ($mathtool.random < 0.5)  \n11:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0## Terminal page  \n11:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so from 5000 pages, half were terminal  \n13:49\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:07\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0@vmassol @mflorea, will do so.
