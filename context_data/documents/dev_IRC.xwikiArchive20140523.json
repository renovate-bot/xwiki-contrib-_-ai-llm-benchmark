ATM several dots are not supported in the XAR import AFAIK  \n17:27\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0:(  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's possible the issue is in the export and not the import  \n17:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the export did not properly escape the dots that's the behavior you will get  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's possible  \n17:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case of you can provide a WAR with which you reproduce the issue it should be easy to see  \n17:34\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0It was created with a 4.2, IIRC.  \n17:34\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Or older...  \n17:34\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0I'll let lynxt jump in, he's the one working on it :D  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a old version of XWiki would not do that escaping  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that could be it  \n17:34\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0the question is : is there a safe way to export wiki pages  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(since escaping to support dot used to not exist at all)  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lynxt: why do you wish to export pages?  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the reason is because of the upgrade then it shouldn't be necessary  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since you don't need to export/reimport when doing an upgrade  \n17:37\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0yeah but the wizard crashes when doing the upgrade  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lynxt: it's still possible it's the import so it would be great if you could provide a XAR in a jira issue and say you have an import issue  \n17:37\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0It's a 500MB XAR with internal secrets. :D sorry  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0an extract of it maybe  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like one page from the zip  \n17:38\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Yeah, that may be possible.  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(the XAR is just a zip)  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at worst even if the issue is on export the document reference is stored in several way, I can maybe find a hack to support packages like this  \n17:41\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Ah! We found out that using the native Export it escapes correctly, Export Tools from Admin Tools not.  \n17:41\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Unfortunately a complete export is too large to be imported.  \n17:42\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0Anyway lynxt is currently on it, we'll keep you updated.  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be nice to report this for the admintools app  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/ADMINTOOL  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tillo: AFAIK http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Large+Wiki+Export do its job properly  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it support any size of wiki  \n17:48\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0tmortagne: he'll try with the latest version of Admin Tools and try that afterwards, thanks.  \n17:55\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:55\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n17:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:56\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0vmassol, ok i've created the issue  \n18:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok build finished after my commit  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some test failures  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/5453/  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't seem related to my change at first sigh but checking more  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it is  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0related  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing  \n18:16\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:27\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:31\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:36\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be ok now\u2026 had to introduce a hack\u2026 :(  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I need to find a solution for fixing this properly  \n19:06\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:29\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:31\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n21:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:14\u00a0<risherry>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:51\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:52\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:26\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n23:37\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
