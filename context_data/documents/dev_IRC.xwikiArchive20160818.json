I guess I was looking for something more streamlined, especially using the tasks. I\u2019ll try to bake that one day.  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: I'm currently looking at XWIKI-13558  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I know what is the issue with $template  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as far as I can see it's a special Velocity binding  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's defined in all Velocity scripts  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I need to add it to the list of variables to not move from VelocityContext to ScriptContext  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0easy fix but since it's a special binding we should probably avoid using it on our side  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fixing the $template variable and I will debug the $title one  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I understand from the \u00a0code is that template is used to deal with scope in Velocity so really not something we should mess with  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: you can see the current known special Velocity bindings in https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/render/DefaultVelocityManager.java#L183  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0adding \"template\" in there  \n15:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: when you have some time, maybe you have some idea to fix http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13609 ?  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like something special on Windows  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but from what I see it should work fine  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(what I see in the code)  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0either a bug in the JVM that was used n this case or Windows does not want to release the file (like it happen sometimes)  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes the problem is that the status.xml file must be loaded when we try to replace it  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this works on linux but not windows  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*is = is probably  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this report is recent and it's working like this since a very long time so it's probably not all Windows or all JVM  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well it depends if some other thread has a handle on it  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it could be a race condition  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for sure it would only happen on windows  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's a warning too  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so most users won't report it  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0manuel said in the issue that he's seen this several times  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0most users probably but Manuel is testing on Windows  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also possible that some refzctoring we did made it happen more often recently  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we're doing a BFD after all? :)  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw we have a thread on the list with some directoy creation failure too  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Caused by: class java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to create directory  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0within 10000 attempts (tried 1471421247917-0 to 1471421247917-9999)  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"NB Just had the same error with the distribution wizard when installing  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0initial set of pages:\"  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02 users having this error apparently  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://xwiki.475771.n2.nabble.com/Distribution-Wizard-td7600517.html#a7600689  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too bad google doesn't show the OS error  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably a permission issue  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'llreply  \n16:27\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n16:34\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Hey guys, anyone knows if plain-http-auth has reasons not work on a vanilla setup?  \n17:00\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I tried with superadmin and a regular admin and both failed.  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea, I don't know about this  \n17:00\u00a0<polx>\u00a0(using plain-auth, obtaining directly a valid page when requesting: http://user:password@server/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences )  \n17:00\u00a0<polx>\u00a0this has been used in multiple automation scripts.  \n17:01\u00a0<polx>\u00a0could it be jetty-bound??  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I thought you were talkig about some header  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http header  \n17:01\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Plain-auth does use header.  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should work OOB AFAIK  \n17:01\u00a0<polx>\u00a0the URL writing is a way to feed the headers.
