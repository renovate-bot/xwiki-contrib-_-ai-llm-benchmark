 \n13:05\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0eg - is is reasonable to import the standard XE ui .xar file in addition to the xem one, and then use the XE one when spawning a new farm-style wiki, but use the XEM one to make new workspace subwikis?  \n13:05\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0we'd like to find a way to have a hybrid server install that permits both  \n13:07\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0hi Rick  \n13:07\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0XEM only adds a few pages on top of XE  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0home page, page for creating a new wiki, etc  \n13:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0actually I'm not so familiar with the new XEM with the new workspaces feature  \n13:08\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0hi Vincent, so some minor mods to the workspace template might suffice to remove the workspace-related menu and other stuff?  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(added in XE 3.4)  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0the best would be for Enygma` to help you out since he's the one who did this.  \n13:09\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0let's wait a bit for him to become avail  \n13:10\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I can see some great advantages for your workspace model, but there are also cases where it would be useful to have a separate wiki which doesn't seem to be connected to any others  \n13:10\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0hence, our interest in a hybrid that permits both  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0yes I understand  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0you could have 2 template wikis  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0one with the workspaces features on and one without  \n13:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0and create your new subwikis based on the template you wish to use  \n13:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I think (hope?) that the workspace-related menus are only displayed when the workspace feature is active locally  \n13:11\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(ie when the workspaces pages are available)  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0Enygma` will be able to tell us how it works  \n13:12\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I may be seeing the workspace menu because I am a main wiki admin  \n13:12\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but there is workspace-related content in the templates, I'm pretty sure  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0sure but usually they'll test for the existence of some page to be active  \n13:13\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0i see  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0depends what you call template  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0here I'm referring to vm files  \n13:13\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Hi. I`m catching up on \u00a0your discussion  \n13:13\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0hi Enygma  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0however above when I said \"template wiki\" I was referring to setting a subwiki to be a template wiki copied when creating a new subwiki  \n13:14\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I may be using the term incorrectly, Vincent. I meant the collection of pages and resources installed in the .xar file  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0ok now that Enygma` is here I'll let him answer since I don't know that well the latest version of XEM  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0rickross: what version of XEM are you using?  \n13:15\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0that seems to reside in workspacetemplate.template.local  \n13:15\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0vmassol1, I have XEM 3.4 installed ATM  \n13:15\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0Hi rickross  \n13:16\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the new XEM comes with the workspaces application bundled in it, but it also has the old wikiManager application as well, so it permits a hibrid usecase as you describe  \n13:16\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0maybe I need another similar template wiki like farmwiki.template.local to have a modified set of pages to support an old-style farm wiki  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0Enygma`: we really need to update manager.xwiki.org documentation...  \n13:17\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0to create workspaces, just use the UI in the main wiki. To create regular subwikis, just go to WikiManager/WebHome and see the create wiki link there with the old wikiManager application  \n13:17\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0Enygma, I read that in the users list, but I was uncertain what to use to create a base set of pages for such a farm wiki?  \n13:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol1: yes, I know  \n13:18\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and I was unclear whether I could import the XE ui .xar file into a separate template wiki, and then base the farm-style new wiki off of that?  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n13:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0rickross: yes, you can. Just use the WikiManager/WebHome as you did before  \n13:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0just don`t touch the \"workspacetemplate\" subwiki template that is used by workspaces :)  \n13:18\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0Enygma, I am a noob :)  \n13:18\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0no \"before\"  \n13:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, you can touch it to customize it, just don`t remove it  \n13:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I see :)  \n13:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so yes, WikiManager is the backbone of Workspaces  \n13:19\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0let me try to understand...  \n13:20\u00a0<rickross>\u00a01 - it IS possible to import the .xar file recommended for XE base template in addition to the .xar file recommended for XEM  \n13:20\u00a0<rickross>\u00a02 - I would use the older wikimanager app to create farm-style subwikis, and they would use the XE templates for their foundation  \n13:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a03 - I would use the new workspace-manager and new XEM template set to create workspace-style subwikis  \n13:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0is this correct?  \n13:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes  \n13:22\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0hmm, so use wikimanager to create a new, empty subwiki  \n13:22\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0then import the base .xar template set from XE, and then mark this subwiki as a template wiki  \n13:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a01. you can import a standard XE xar into a new subwiki template by using wikimanager, then you create new subwikis by using the just created template.  \n13:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0or as you just described  \n13:22\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and use it to spawn additional farm-style subwikis?  \n13:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0both work  \n13:23\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0ok, cool  \n13:23\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0lemme try this out  \n13:23\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0one more issue  \n13:23\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I created a workspace using the subwiki identifier I wanted  \n13:23\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but then I realized that I didn't want a workspce, but instead wanted a farm-style wiki  \n13:24\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I deleted the workspace, and now I cannot seem to re-use that wiki identifier (the db is created, but there's apparently an error, and the db remains empty)  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we had a bug recently about this\u2026 let me try to find it  \n13:26\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes, it's a known bug XWIKI-7413  \n13:26\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7413  \n13:26\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I wonder if I should just pull from your nightlies for experimenting, or maybe from your trunk  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rickross: try restarting your wki if you haven't done so already  \n13:26\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the workaround for now is to restart your XWiki instance  \n13:26\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0beautiful - thanks, Vincet!  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to work around the bug)  \n13:27\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I love an easy solution :)  \n13:27\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it's a caching issue :)  \n13:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:51\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0success! using wikimanager to add a new \"farmtemplate\" based on the standard XE \"xwiki-enterprise-ui-all-3.4.xar\" and then spawning new farm wiki with that template  \n13:52\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0when I am logged in (probably since I am a main wiki admin) there is still a \"Main\" menu showing at the top  \n13:52\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0with \"workspacemanager.menu.mainwiki.admin\" and \"workspacemanager.menu.workspace.index\"  \n13:55\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0actually, the \"ADD\" menu also shows \"workspacemanager.menu.create\" as it's forst menu item  \n13:56\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I was hoping these things would be invisible on the farm-style subwiki  \n14:03\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0rickross: They are visible to you because you are a global user (and admin, but this does not matter). To local users to the subwiki, the menus will not appear since they are not aware of the global context and are \"isolated\" inside the local wiki.  \n14:04\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the fact that instead of \"Workspace Directory\" you have translation keys like \"workspacemanager.menu.workspace.index\" is because the translations are located on the main wiki in wiki pages and the subwiki you are looking at does not use those pages as translations. This should be fixed in future versions when the translations will be moved from wiki pages to java translations, in ApplicationResources.properties, so that they are visible to all the wikis.  \n14:05\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but only global users that visit regular subwikis are currently affected by this \"inconvenience\" so the impact is, let's say, minimal.  \n14:10\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0Enygma, that works for me - thanks  \n14:10\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0is it easy enough to add back those translations somehow?  \n14:11\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I like your idea to move those strings to Java properties files that are accessible  \n14:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0rickross: I supposed that the quickest solution for you would be to just use the translations documents in your subwikis. Since subwikis are created by admins, it should be under your control. So just go to the Administration section of the subwiki, Configuration>Localisation and add to Internationalization Document Bundles the page \"xwiki:WorkspaceManager.Translations\"  \n14:20\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0ok, thx  \n14:20\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0for the ApplicationResources thing, I was waiting for a cleaner way of doing it in XWiki; a way that allows extensions to come up with their own ApplicationResources.properties file instead of just pushing everything in the default platform one.  \n14:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0works perfectly - no icons for those menu items in the top menubar  \n14:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but that is not an issue  \n14:22\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0at least, not for me  \n14:27\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0rickross: hm... yes, you are right. The icons are a bit of another story. You could do a trick for that too  \n14:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0If you like, you could add a page in the XWiki space of the subwiki and add a StyleSheetExtension object in it. In the content of the SSX object, add these lines:  \n14:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0#set ($workspaceManagerStyleDocumentReference = $services.model.createDocumentReference($xcontext.mainWikiName, 'WorkspaceManager', 'Style'))  \n14:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0#if ($xwiki.exists($workspaceManagerStyleDocumentReference))  \n14:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0@import \"$xwiki.getURL($workspaceManagerStyleDocumentReference, 'ssx', '')\";  \n14:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0#end  \n14:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0set the extension to be used on the entire wiki and that the content is parsed. Save and hard refresh (ctrl+f5). You should have the icons too now.  \n15:00\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0Here's a question.. Even though I happen to know that AppWithinMinutes is installed, how would I search to determine whether it is?  \n15:01\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0it is unclear whether the search bar on the \"Installed Extentions\" and \"Core Extensions\" is to help me add a new one, or to discover whether one is already present  \n15:01\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and AppWithinMinutes does not show as an installed extension, so it must be core  \n15:02\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but wading through 16 pages of core extensions to confirm that is not fun  \n15:24\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0has quit  \n16:05\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe mircea should use more the preview feature ;)  \n16:35\u00a0<helge>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<helge>\u00a0@dumitriu: Hi Dumitriu, I did a fresh install of XE 3.4 with a clean Database and copy-pasted some pages from the old install.
