M2 is supposed to happen today  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I just mentioned that today is supposed to be release day  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to decide what we do  \n13:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0release it as is and it's not a problem that there isn't much done in 3.1 (which is fine for me). The main work will be in 3.2 then  \n13:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or postpone the release  \n13:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So far the roadmap features didn't progress that much  \n13:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in general I'm way more for time boxing  \n13:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0M1 was busy with the git move  \n13:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And for M2 I've been busy with the Ia?i visit  \n13:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can present 3.1 as a stabilization release  \n13:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/can/could/  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we postpone it's going to be a long postponing IMO  \n13:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+1  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd say at least 3 weeks  \n13:35\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0+1  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+1 for what? :)  \n13:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So, cjdelisle: Are you available to do the release today?  \n13:35\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0git move is anyway a big move  \n13:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+1 it's going to be long  \n13:35\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0and it is worse a release  \n13:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So -1 to postpone  \n13:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0s/worse/worth  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok good  \n13:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Right?

 \n14:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0vmassol: build of platform is still failing on ci: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/132/console it seems to be a pom version declaration issue  \n14:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0(didn't know if you're on it or not, just wanting to see the enterprise tests results)  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: tmortagne looked at it last friday and couldn't reproduce it locally although he could on the hudson agent  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I also don't have it locally  \n14:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so noone is on it?  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm on customer support  \n14:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok  \n14:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: I doubt anyone is on it, I can reproduce on agent1 but I can't find why there is this issue, the commons pom contains the version and I'm sure the build use the right one since I deleted all the other versions  \n14:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0could it be the maven version on ci?  \n14:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I have 2.2.1 on local, and I can build fine  \n14:33\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I mean, so far  \n14:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: no it's not maven version I tried the exact same version  \n14:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and pretty much the same environment since I'm on ubuntu and agent1 on debian iff I remember well  \n14:40\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:41\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok, what does this mean here?

 \n14:43\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0maybe that's where the pom inheritance doesn't work properly?  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: yes but anyway it's just a shortcut to speed up things  \n14:43\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but for example doesn't work on my local  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if relativePath is not good in your environment then mavne will download it  \n14:44\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok  \n14:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and in agent1 case it downloads it  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: checking with ludovic/florin to see what's needed from us on the storage thing  \n14:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(I removed it from local repository and I find it after the build is done)  \n14:45\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok...  \n14:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the \"good\" things is that I can reproduce the failure bu hand on agent1 but I could not find what is the real difference with my environment where it does not fail  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: maven automatically looks up one directroy up when looking up for parent poms (unless you specified relativepath)  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this allows to build locally without connection to a remote repo)  \n14:52\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0also, I have a compilation error when building platform locally  \n14:52\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0[ERROR] BUILD FAILURE  \n14:52\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n14:52\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0[INFO] Compilation failure  \n14:52\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0/home/lucaa/xwiki/src/xwiki-trunks/platform/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-extension/xwiki-platform-extension-repositories/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-aether/src/main/java/org/xwiki/extension/repository/aether/internal/plexus/DefaultPlexusComponentManager.java:[47,19] logger is already defined in org.xwiki.extension.repository.aether.internal.plexus.DefaultPlexusComponentManager  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed fixing  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0must have done a bad merge  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixed  \n14:57\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and could I change the relative path of the parent pom of xwiki-platform to a correct one? just to see what happens? \u00a0\u00a0( tmortagne? )  \n14:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: on the agent?  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(because the value is a correct one - at least the one we want)  \n14:58\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0why do we want that value?  \n14:58\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it doesn't make sense on my machine, nor on the agent  \n14:58\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I think  \n14:58\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0lemme double check  \n14:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the one corresponding to a git clone of all git repos at the same level  \n14:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which makes sense)  \n14:59\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0what I have is a clone of xwiki-trunks  \n14:59\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and commons folder name is not xwiki-commons, but plain simple commons  \n14:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: xwiki-trunks is actually wrong and supposed to be modified  \n15:00\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0just like platform  \n15:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(though it was already done)  \n15:00\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0maybe it was after I cloned...  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sergiu said he fixed it AFAIR  \n15:00\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ah right I see  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu?  \n15:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep it's modified  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: nm  \n15:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, it should be xwiki-commons now  \n15:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But fetching xwiki-trunks won't delete commons, it will just create a new xwiki-commons next to it  \n15:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's the developer's task to use the correct directory and remove the old one  \n15:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0cool, xwiki-platform is building now  \n15:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it seems  \n15:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0thanks, if anyone did anything to it  \n15:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0there are a lot of checksum failures though  \n15:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0on downloading stull  \n15:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0stuff  \n15:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0let's hope it's gonna be an up to date build, though  \n15:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:22\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: you can use -U to be extra sure it download the latest snapshots  \n15:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0something's a bit concerning with the csrf tests  \n15:28\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it's 8 tests which take 409 seconds to run  \n15:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0on hudson, which is supposed to be a good machine  \n15:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it's a problem with lack of random entropy  \n15:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the fix is to provide fake random which I did for most of crypto  \n15:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and no hudson is not supposed to be a good machine  \n15:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it's a 3 core amd, IMO it's underutilized because we don't have maven3 with threading.  \n15:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: agents are 3 core amd ?
