Maybe I didn't read the syntax page carefully enough but I totally missed that.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:37): So ((( = div?  \ntmortagne - (10:38): I just looked and there is no explicit example for the group syntax but i guess it's because all syntaxes support custom parameters except macros  \ntmortagne - (10:38): CalebJamesDeLisl: yes (( = div in xhtml renderer  \ntmortagne - (10:38): in rendering it's a \"group of standalone elements\"  \ntmortagne - (10:38): pretty much the same definition than a div  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:39): Well that makes things easier. I have a bunch of code to fix now.  \ntmortagne - (10:39): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax#HGroups  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:40): I saw that, I never knew that it made a div and I could apply attributes to it though.  \ntmortagne - (10:40): the explanation is too much about \u00a0table and list  \ntmortagne - (10:40): yep it's a bit poor  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:42): Well I will remove my {{div}} macro then.  \nmariusbutuc joined #xwiki at 10:44  \ntmortagne - (10:44): anyway good thing to track all use case where we are using html amcro that we could translate into something more generic  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:45): Maybe we should have the syntax page on xwiki.org be a regular page (not autoloaded from svn) so we can work on it then commit from time to time.  \ntmortagne - (10:47): well at least this way it force us to have an updated syntax page in XE but i agree it's a pain to update it  \nsilviar left #xwiki at 10:47  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:48): Maybe Drafts.XWikiSyntax?  \ntmortagne - (10:49): problem is to keep this Drafts.XWikiSyntax sync with svn when someone directly fix in svn  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:50): Good point.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 11:03  \nmflorea left at 11:44 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmariusbutuc left at 12:20 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmariusbutuc joined #xwiki at 12:22  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 12:34  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 12:41  \nmariusbutuc left at 12:44 (Quit: Leaving.  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 12:57  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 13:05  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:09): evalica: I don't see the red color you chose for the invitation decline link in the default color theme, can you recommend a choice?  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 13:13  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 13:14  \nvmassol1 joined #xwiki at 13:14  \nvmassol left at 13:17 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nvmassol1 is now known as vmassol ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nvmassol left at 13:36 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nevalica - (13:40): CalebJamesDeLisl: we don't have yet the extension for ColorTheme - it is a proposal made http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Improvements/ColorThemesExtensions#HColorstoaddtotheColorThemeClass28DRAFT29  \nevalica - (13:41): you should use a hardcoded color - and when we make the extension replaced it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (13:41): Sounds good.
