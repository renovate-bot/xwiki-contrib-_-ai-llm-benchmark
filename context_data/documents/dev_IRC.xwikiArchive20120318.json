You took on a hard project and made good progress, it was unfortunate that the project didn't have a good definition of success. You definitely stuck with it and made good code though.  \n11:49\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0thanks  \n11:50\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0im also applying to apache since its related to my final year project. but my initial GSoC idea overlaps another idea so may have come up with a new one  \n11:51\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0if i find an interesting on at Xwiki ill give it a try also :)  \n11:51\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0which apache project?
