 \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0two paragraphs are separated by an empty line  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0two consecutive lines does not make two different paragrahs  \n17:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: \u00a0this http://hastebin.com/tomofehufo.django generates this http://hastebin.com/aripikudog.xml  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://hastebin.com/tomofehufo.django is not two standalone macros  \n17:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so no diference if include and velocity are on the same line or not  \n17:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you need an empty line for that  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0getting a <br> is actually the only thing right about \u00a0http://hastebin.com/aripikudog.xml  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is not right is getting several <p>  \n17:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0wow... that new line between include and velocity made the paragraphs go away... because that was intuitive! (not!)  \n17:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but thanks anyway. I will add a comment to that issue  \n17:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0now, why would it be intuitive to add an empty line (which generally translates into getting a new paragraph in wiki syntax) between those macros?  \n17:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0thats because you have a weird definition of a paragraph, when you have http://hastebin.com/tutufuroso.hs is a single paragraph on a book that's one prargraph not two  \n17:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/prargraph/paragraph/  \n17:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the fact that it's macro does not matter  \n17:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the same for any content  \n17:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so if I have \"a\" on one line, then an empty space and then \"b\" on the 3rd line, is that 2 paragraphs?  \n17:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yeah, that`s silly http://hastebin.com/ojixakojav.xml  \n17:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I mean, it`s not silly  \n17:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the macro behavior is silly because it does not respect this  \n17:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0replace \"a\" with an \"include\" and \"b\" with a \"velocity\" and the above principle is not respected  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: as I told you the fact that you end up with several <p> is a bug  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and a recent one AFAIK  \n17:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you really separate the macros it behave as expected  \n17:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: it behaves as expected, but it is still wrong, right?  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is wrong ?  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand what you means  \n17:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0is this correct http://hastebin.com/ojixakojav.xml ?  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://hastebin.com/ojixakojav.xml is what I explained to you, you get two paragraphs because you do have two paragraphs  \n17:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so it is correct  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it is correct, when did I told you it wasn't ?  \n17:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, I got it now :)  \n17:52\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so in any case, the empty paragraphs before and after are a bug  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the multiple <p> are wrong yes, there should be only one (with a div inside because you kind of \"force\" it in the velocity macro)  \n17:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thanks tmortagne  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's why I did not closed the jira issue  \n18:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have to go, guys please try to not commit dangerous things on master and I will release 6.3M1 as soon as I open my computer tomorrow morning  \n18:01\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, no dangerous ... too late, I am afraid ;)  \n18:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're still loosing by 1 bug for thie week (and we lost by 2 last week): http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa#Created-vs-Resolved-Chart/10470 ;)  \n18:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe I should not open two bugs that I notice while fixing one bug ;)  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n18:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:54\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n19:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n20:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:12\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:38\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:39\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n21:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:03\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:39\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:56\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:57\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:24\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
