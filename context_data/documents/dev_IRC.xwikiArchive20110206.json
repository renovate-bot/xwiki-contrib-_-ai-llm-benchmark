I looked at the storage code and AFAICT the change to the cache should not have exposed a bug.  \n14:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0also I had no trouble creating an empty group, adding a user, deleting the user and seeing the empty group again.  \n14:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0be back in a while, coffee.  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: ok here it goes  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) create a new subwiki on myxwiki.org (for ex)  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) register a new user in your newly created wiki  \n14:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03) go in admin, users screen and remove the Admin user  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a04) go in the admin, groups screen and notice the admin group is not there anymore  \n14:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I think that's what I did)  \n15:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Thanks.
