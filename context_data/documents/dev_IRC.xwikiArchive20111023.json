 \n13:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah wait, I forgot something  \n13:04\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:04\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok should be really ok now  \n13:06\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0Thanks! \u00a0Now I can assign issues.  \n13:08\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0I was thinking about setting up a cia.vc account for xwiki and adding a bot to this channel to read out commits as they are pushed, any thoughts?  \n13:12\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisl1: that's not needed AFAIK  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you simply need to add a botlet  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that uses github REST api  \n13:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very simple  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since I've already put some examples of that on extensions.xwiki.org  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah you want the notification\u2026 hmmm  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it's easy too  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since github can be configured to call a page  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when a commit is pushed  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so all we need to do is create that page and send the notif using the xwiki irc bot  \n13:15\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0sounds like a lot of work, the nice thing about cia.vc is I just did it for my project and it's like a 10 minute job at most  \n13:15\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0and everything \"just works\" from the start  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I'd prefer that we use our bot  \n13:15\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0ok  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it makes it even better  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that said I haven't done so so far because I'm not sure we need/want it  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since we receive notification by email already)  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that would be receiving the same information in two channels  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a bit overkill IMO  \n13:17\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0the only advantage in my mind is that it's immediate and less likely to get lost in the flood of hudson spam.  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0email is also immediate  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(within 2 minutes)  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we cannot remove it  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because not everyone is on irc and people can be offline  \n13:17\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0/nod  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the email is better than the irc notifications in this regards  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it serves two purpose  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the only question  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is whether people who are on irc are ok to receive all notifications twice  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could ask on the devs list maybe  \n13:18\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0IMO it's not so important that it's worth writing code for it.  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally I'm 0 (maybe ?0 but I won't oppose it)  \n13:31\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:47\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0vmassol: what did you want me to check?
