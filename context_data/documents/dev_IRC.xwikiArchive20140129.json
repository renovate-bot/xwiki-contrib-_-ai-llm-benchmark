 \n11:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0just asking if it is, as I need to update it to 5.x for some folks asking for it  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not sure who is \"him\", http://main.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/mrawash does not exist  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anymore  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like it's been deleted  \n11:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0niot sure if that app is the right way into the future, so maybe I just update it until it is \"good enough\" and upload the next version to to e.x.o, like Marius did for the last versions  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: I think now it would be done using AppWithinMinutes  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Task+Manager+Application cover your use case  \n11:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, me too, except that folks have about 100 old existing ToDos that they do not want to loose  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: since the license is LGPL you can fork it on xwiki-contrib  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and continue the work there  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if you want)  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and release a newer version  \n11:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0\u00a0well, me just wondering which one of the Todo applications is the \"most maintained\" one ;)  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahah that's always an issue :)  \n11:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0for the first attempt I will just update the version on e.x.o  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0once you know, would be great to edit them with some info box to explain the pros and cons of each ;)  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ci is back for a while  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep just seen it  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's hurry up to release :)  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not according to jenkins state  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0triggered rendering  \n11:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: any idea what could cause http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/lastBuild/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/testReport/org.xwiki.test.ui.appwithinminutes/UserClassFieldTest/testSingleSelection/, it does not seems to be a flicker (age 8)  \n12:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no, I need to check locally  \n12:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: the css issue on jenkins could be fixed by \"Broken CSS when reloading Jenkins after a time of inactivity\" in 1.549 (http://jenkins-ci.org/changelog)  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0arf seems they put in the RN but it may not be fixed since the issue isn't closed yet, see last comment of https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-17526  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acutally code has been committed  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems this issue is only on mac osx though  \n12:41\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I cannot reproduce UserClassFieldTest#testSingleSelection locally, I tried a few times but it always passes..  \n13:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I need to debug it on the agent  \n13:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: ok  \n13:43\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0document.set(\"param name\",\"value\"); should set value for parameter with that name, right? and document.save() should save it then (xwiki.api.Document)... if this is correct, why cannot i see the change? (no changes, no modified params, no errors)  \n13:45\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I personaly always do object.set() instead of document.set()  \n13:50\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, still no change  \n13:52\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0Date param is java.util.Date, right?  \n13:55\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, its changed (if i print it), it just doesn't show  \n14:02\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0isn't there a bug with Date field? (second one shows same value as first)  \n14:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, {{include document=\"AppWithinMinutes.Date\"/}} caused that... i wonder what that is  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: any idea or http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-wiki-test-tests/4927/testReport/org.xwiki.wiki.test.ui/WikiTest/createWikiFromTemplate/ ? age 3 so does not looks like a flicker  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but maybe jenkins was just lucky  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/or/for/  \n14:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I do not understand  \n15:07\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0what would be the proper way to downgrade an install ? i've been using the packages from the \"releases\" branch, uninstalled them and reinstalled from \"stable\"  \n15:08\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0now the distribution wizard complains, when asked to downgrade: The extension [com.xpn.xwiki.products:xwiki-enterprise-wiki-5.4-milestone-1] is already installed  \n15:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol is teaching me how to improve my integration test  \n15:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n15:09\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0reason for downgrade: upgrade to 5.4-milestone1 borked my UI/main page  \n15:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tekzilla: you are moving from which version to which version exactly ?  \n15:25\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0tmortagne: from 5.4-milestone1 to 5.3 from the stable repo  \n15:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you downgraded the WAR to 5.3 and now it complain saying that \"com.xpn.xwiki.products:xwiki-enterprise-wiki-5.4-milestone-1\" is already installed ?  \n15:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0where is this message displayed exactly ?  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a screenshot would be great  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you get \"downgrade\" button ?  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case if you change the WAR to 5.3 it looks like a bug to be so it would be great if you could report an issue on http://jira.xwiki.org  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/be/me/  \n15:31\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0the message is displayed in the distribution wizard after login  \n15:31\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0i do get a downgrade button  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you get that after clicking on downgrade ?  \n15:31\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0i'll make a screenshot of it, will be in german  \n15:31\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0yes  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no need for the scheenshot  \n15:32\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0ok  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have some idea of what could be the issue but it's not a quickfix, would be great if you could create an issue on http://jira.xwiki.org  \n15:33\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0ok i'll do that  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as for the workaround all I can think of is downgrade one by one all the 5.4-milestone-1 extension in Extension Manager  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so skip the DW  \n15:34\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0ok didnt know i could just skip over it  \n15:34\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0would it be possible to just downgrade the problematic extension (in this case it seems to be the wiki core?) and run the wizard again for the rest ?  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but downgrade all one them one by one is not going to be an painless task (if that even work or all of them)  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tekzilla: xwiki-enterprise-wiki is the top level extension for the UI  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not just some extension  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: do we have downgrade UI tests for EM ?  \n15:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think we do  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think I remember one but not sure  \n15:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/blob/master/xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-extension/src/test/it/org/xwiki/test/ui/extension/ExtensionTest.java#L787  \n15:37\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0so why is the 5.4 version of the extension even still present, i removed all xwiki packages (leaving config and DB in place) before reinstalling 5.3  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tekzilla: xwiki-enterprise-wiki is not a jar  \n15:38\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0ah ok the pages get imported into the database ?  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so xwiki-enterprise-wiki and its dependencies are the pages you have in your wikis  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/wikis/wiki/  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't know why it does not want to to do the downgrade  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway with your issue and detailed steps to reproduce we can reproduce and look at it  \n15:40\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0ok i'll try the manual downgrade then.. or export my stuff and do a clean install  \n15:40\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0yeah i'll file an issue and report back  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sorry about that  \n15:42\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0no problem! most of the time i love using xwiki, which you provide for free, won't hear me complain :)  \n15:44\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0and regardless of it being free... humans have bugs -> software has bugs  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep but this one is hard to recover from :)  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys (tmortagne, mflorea, gdelhumeau): could you check this list of jiras with issues affecting 5.2.2 or 5.2.3 and that haven't been fixed in 5.2.3 or 5.2.4?
