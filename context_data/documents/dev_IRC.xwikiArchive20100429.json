I found the \"plain\" syntax existing in wiki parser, anyone has an advice to \"add\" the macro syntax parsing ?  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 10:17  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:18): temporalfox: I think \"plain\" is only an output syntax. I think you can however create your own syntax which is a subset of xwiki/2.0 containing only the macros. I don't know much about the rendering engine, you can get more info from tmortagne when he shows up.  \ntemporalfox - (10:18): there is a parser too  \ntemporalfox - (10:18): I'm only interested in parsing  \ntemporalfox - (10:19): PlainTextBlockParser  \ntemporalfox - (10:19): is therea a guide or something to customize the xwiki/2.0 syntax or just a track to follow ?  \ntemporalfox - (10:20): actually : PlainTextStreamParser for the parser  \nSvenDowideit left at 10:20 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nSvenDowideit\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:21  \nSvenDowideit\\_ is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:22): I know you can create and add parsers. Again I don't know much about that part.  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:23  \ntemporalfox - (10:23): ok, I'll try to find out  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 10:24  \nglerouge joined #xwiki at 10:27  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 10:28  \nsilviar left at 10:42 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 10:43  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 10:43  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:47): evalica: Looking at http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Improvements/InvitationProposal/Inv3.png How did you get those 10px horizontal grey lines (below Email | Sent date...) Do you have a style sheet for the mockup?  \ntmortagne - (10:50): CalebJamesDeLisl: did you received my message yesterday about impossibility to have a Configurable UI without the form and save button around it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:50): I did. That is not correct behavior. I might have broke it when I put in javascript to unify the save buttons.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:51): If so then disabling script will remove the button.  \ntmortagne - (10:53): CalebJamesDeLisl: indeed i disabled js with noscript and i get my buttons now  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:54): The rule for when there is a save button should be: If the section exists prior to adding the Configurable object OR if (any of) the configurable object(s) defines a custom configuration class.  \nSvenDowideit\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:55  \ntmortagne - (10:56): CalebJamesDeLisl: i have only one Configurable object without any custom configuration class in it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:56): Yes, that's my bad javascript going haywire.  \ntmortagne - (10:56): you can reproduce easily by just having an empty Configurable object in some document with just the section configured  \nSvenDowideit left at 10:57 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nSvenDowideit\\_ is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:59): Looks like the easy solution is to only pull in the jssx object if there are multiple forms.  \nevalica - (11:02): CalebJamesDeLisl: for the Invitation Manager - yes I have the CSS - I will put it in 15 minutes on the incubator  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:02): Thanks.  \ntmortagne - (11:05): CalebJamesDeLisl: creating a jira issue  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:05): Thanks, I think I have the fix.

For instance, let's say I have [xwiki, Main, Alice] and [xwiki, Main, Bob]. I want to serialize Bob relative to Alex, and thus I want to obtain just \"Bob\". If I were to serialize Bob relative to [xwiki, Blog, Carol] I would expect to get \"Main.Bob\". I've looked in the xwiki-model but I couldn't find such a entity reference serializer..  \ntmortagne - (16:21): mflorea: that is supported by all serializer, just give your base reference as second parameter  \nmflorea - (16:21): hmm, let me check  \ntmortagne - (16:22): not all serializer actually  \ntmortagne - (16:22): all resolver but for serializer it's all except the default one  \ntmortagne - (16:22): i think  \ntmortagne - (16:22): let me see  \ntmortagne - (16:23): well actually it's not the right way to see it  \nmflorea - (16:23): but resolvers add missing parts, they don't remove shared parts, at least that's what I understood  \ntmortagne - (16:24): giving base reference is supported by all serializer  \ntmortagne - (16:24): but the you have to choose the serializer bahavior you want  \ntmortagne - (16:24): do you want to compact oly wiki part or everything  \ntmortagne - (16:25): so in your case it's \"compact\" serializer i think since you want the whole thing  \ntmortagne - (16:25): and you give Alex reference as second parameter  \ntmortagne - (16:25): niot second sorry, last parameter  \ntmortagne - (16:25): an example will be better :) :  \ntmortagne - (16:26): compactSerializer.serialize(bobReference, alexReference)  \nmflorea - (16:26): I wan't to remove all the parts that are the same as in the base reference. If only the wiki si the same, then just the wiki should be omitted, if the space is the same too, then the space should be omitted too  \ntmortagne - (16:26): and you use \"compact\" as serializer hint  \ntmortagne - (16:27): mflorea: most of the serializer/resolver implementations are in xwiki-core  \nmflorea - (16:27): oh, I was looking in the xwiki-model  \nmflorea - (16:27): that's why I haven't seen the compact serializer  \ntmortagne - (16:27): but giving a base reference is supported by all serializer/resolvers anyway  \nmflorea - (16:27): sure  \ntmortagne - (16:27): so it's only about what you want to remove  \nmflorea - (16:28): ok, let me try the compact serializer  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 16:50  \nmflorea - (16:55): tmortagne: the compact serializer works great, thanks!  \ntmortagne - (16:55): mflorea: np :)  \nevalica left at 17:10 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nEnygma` left at 17:12 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsilviar left at 17:16 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne - (17:21): what is the best way to split a string into a List<String> in velocity ?
