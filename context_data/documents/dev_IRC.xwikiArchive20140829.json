I'm continuing this morning  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: restarting jenkins, there were 2 plugins that had newer versions  \n08:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0btw we have lots of plugins with probably some of them useless like LDAP plugin  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I started disalbing several  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for some I didn't know if we were using them or not  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll continue disabling some now  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: restarted 2 jobs, let's see how it goes now  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one of the plugin I updated was the email ext plugin so there's hope  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I doubt we need PAM Authentication plugin  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is to connect to jenkins using the system users  \n09:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also we don't really care about Translation Assistance plugin ourself  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I removed all those plugins once but jenkins was not restarting so I put them back  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I tried this a few days ago)  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0PAM Authentication plugin ?  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I kept the PAM one but the other ones you mentioned I removed  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll try again but this time one by one  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you disabled the PAM one?  \n09:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0started but looks like I need to restart to actually disable it so I did not do it  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check the 2 running jobs status  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one is almost done  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: no signed script work anymore for 6.2? You have 2 issues listed on the roadmap! :)  \n09:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0no time for that hopelessly, not abandoned, but delayed at least, would be nice to have some help on this :)  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I highly doubt you'll get any help on this topic, unless you ask simple questions on the list :)  \n09:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0It is mainly a matter of priority, anyway, and it seems we have more and more issue that we expect to solve with signed scripts  \n09:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the complex part is done  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in addition  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now that we know that signed scripts are coming  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're delaying other solutions...  \n09:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0we need to integrate, and as you know, I have less time for that now  \n09:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this is why, if we want that to speed up, working in team would help  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be nice that you send a mail on the list explaining the status and what's left to do precisely  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could try finding someone interested  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all the people I know are busy on stuff for 6.2 already  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0roadmap for 6.3 is not done yet though  \n09:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am afraid, it will be short for 6.2, but having it in 6.x seems still possible if I get some help  \n09:28\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I hope this is fixing some bugs because we need to stabilize now for RC1 :)  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0JGroups minor version is always about bugfixing  \n10:12\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki

to remove it and to remove the branch  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the jira versions  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe a mail?  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in case someone needed a 6.0.2  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't plan to remove the branch rigth now but it makes jenkins do useless work IMO, we can always put them back later  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think the email would be good since I don't tgink we need a 6.0.x  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can do it if you want  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: it's not useless if we want a 6.0.2  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since it breaks  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0talking about jenkins  \n10:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually wait it's 6.1 breaking  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where's 6.0 on jenkins?  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see it  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's because I removed it  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I personaly don't agree to remove anyihtng on jenkins  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we have the branch and the jira version  \n10:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't support 6.0 branch  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we want a release we need to ensure it continues to work at all times  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you say it but it's not official  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some people have done efforts  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in merging their work on the 6.0.x branch  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to be sure we don't want to release a 6.0.x  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't know about others  \n10:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"you say it but it's not official\", really ?  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since we arlady released a 6.0.1  \n10:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you mixing 6.1 et 6.0 ?  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n10:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course it's official that we don't support any other branch than the stable, dev and latest cycle  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is a bug fix release  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from 6.0.1  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway it's faster to send an email than to argue pointlessly here  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doing it  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and ? we don't support 6..x officially again  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahgain  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jenkins, git and jira go toegtehr  \n11:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we merge stuff on it by reflex that's all  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's one or nothing, if you don't do this then you break the dev process  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/one/all  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the end I'm pretty we'll all agree about dropping 6.0.2  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*sure  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but by deference it's nice to ask and to remove the 3 things  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex, in my mail I also mention I'd like to do a 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 releases  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(without asking me)  \n11:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit
