If such a URL is loaded, the session get killed.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 09:58): I've found in the source code a code snippet, where I can set a 'secure' flag and then it will use https for the 'serverurl' (has something to do with virtual wikis). Can I set such a flag for one wiki (not using virtual wikis)?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:06): hi \\_steffen\\_   \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:07): vmassol: Hi.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:07): yes there are some issues with SSL. Let me try to find the jira issue we have about it (maybe you opened it?)  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:08): Maybe you mean this one: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-227  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:08): vmassol: The fix mentioned in the bug report isn't changing anything for me. Problem still exists.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:09): no there's another pb  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:09): vmassol: Ok. If you find the bug report, please let me know. Maybe I can help fixing it...  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:11): I asked someone who had the issue to create the jira issue but I can't find it  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:11): maybe he hasn't created it  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:12): \\_steffen\\_: if you could identify when exactly the pb happens  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:12): and describe how to reproduce it  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:12): that would be great  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:12): (in a jira issue)  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:12): I think one pb is on redirects  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:12): when you're not logged in  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:13): after you log in you're redriected but in http and not https  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:13): vmassol: I've found another issue in jira (is already fixed), but there is this (at least for me) mysteriously 'secure' flag. I don't know how to set this flag.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:13): Back in a few minutes.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:14): \\_steffen\\_: you have the url?  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:23): vmassol: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2474  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:24): \\_steffen\\_: yes but that's another one  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:24): there's no secure flag  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:24): this bug was fixed in 1.5M2  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:24): vmassol: I think the 'wrong' redirects (http instead of https) are creating my problem.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:24): a few days ago  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:25): \\_steffen\\_: if you could open a jira for this it would be great since I don't think we have one  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:25): vmassol: This secure flag is mentioned in 'public URL getServerURL(String database, XWikiContext context) throws MalformedURLException' in file xwiki-core/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/XWiki.java  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:26): Line 4201  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:26): Has something to do with XWiki.XWikiServerClass  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:26): But I don't know, what this is for.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:26): ah you seemto know more than I do on this... ;)  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:26): let me check  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:27): vmassol: I'd like to help as best as I can to get my problem fixed.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:27): \\_steffen\\_: ok I've checked  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:27): I don't thin this flag is used a tall  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:27): it's for multiwikis and I think it's not used and was meant to signify if a given subwki is private or not  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:28): ah no  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:28): I'm wrong  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:28): let me ask someone  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:28): vmassol: Thanks.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:28): thomasmortagne: do you know what this flag is? Is it meant to signify that such a given subwiki is meant to accesssed using https?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:28): \\_steffen\\_: it's for multiwiki for sure  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:28): is that what you have?  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:29): If I'm hover the log-out link with my mouse, I'm seeing an xredirect without https. Have you meant this some time before?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:29): yes this is a problem  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:29): vmassol: I'm not using multiwiki mode. But if this will be fixing my problem, I will try to switch.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:29): should be raised in a jira issue  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:30): \\_steffen\\_: no no  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:30): vmassol: Ok. Will open a issue.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:30): what I mean is that if you're not in multiwiki then the code you're showing me is not used  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:30): vmassol: Ok.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:32): vmassol: For which project is this issue?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:32): XWiki Core  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:32): Ok  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:38): vmassol: Here is the jira issue: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2502  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:38): Please let me know, if you think, that there is information missing.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:38): cool thanks \\_steffen\\_   \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:39): now if you have a patch you can attach it to the jira issue... ;) otherwise someone will look into this but can't guarantee when. seems like important though  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:39): vmassol: Is 1.5m2 released?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:39): yes  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:39): almost  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:39): the release process was started yesterday  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:39): and will be finished today  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:40): vmassol: Great. I will have a look, if this is fixing anything for me.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:40): ok cool  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:40): thanks  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:41): vmassol: But I think, that there are more problems with SSL than only this one. I will show you, just a second.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:42): vmassol: macros.vm:#set($onurl = \"http://${request.serverName}${xwiki.getSkinFile('aimonline.gif')}\")  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:42): I don't know if this is in use, but if it is, there is more to fix than only wrong redirects...  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:43): can you http:/rafb.net/paste it instead?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:43): (it didn't show properly here)  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:44): Sure.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:45): vmassol: http://rafb.net/p/puVOzl64.html  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:46): This is only for displaying im states, but at least, it is wrong, if XWiki is used entirely over SSL.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:46): The file where I have found this is macros.vm  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:47): yes I know about this one actually  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:47): I've never bothered to file a jira for it though... was lazy...  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:48): since this is not a very used macro but yes you're right  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:48): feel free to file a jira  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:48): vmassol: I will do. :)  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:48): I've done that same thing that you did actually  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:48): which is search for \"http\" in all sources  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:51): vmassol: I've also tried fixing it through setting the scheme to https in XWikiServletURLFactory.java instead of using getScheme(), but this hasn't changed anything.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:52): vmassol: But it hasn't changed something to fail, too :)  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:52): \\_steffen\\_: the best to fix this is to start xwiki in debug mode  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:52): then using an IDE do remote debugging and step in the code  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:53): if you're itnerested there are instructions on http://dev.xwiki.org/  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:53): vmassol: I've tried this with eclipse, but with no success. It's displaying the running threads but I can set no breakpoints or see variables. If I add my source directory, eclipse is crashing...  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:54): worked fine for me in both IDEA and eclipse  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:54): weird  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:55): \\_steffen\\_: the entry point for this in xwiki is LoginAction  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:55): it calls the login.vm velocity template  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:55): vmassol: Maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm checking out the source code of version 1.5m1 (the version I'm running) and import this code in eclipse as a maven project.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:55): sounds good  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:56): Ok. But I don't know why eclipse is crashing if I start debug mode...  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:56): \\_steffen\\_: btw did you see this tutorial: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/BuildingInEclipse ?  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:56): Yes.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:56): here I was talking about remote debugging   \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:57): ie you run start\\_xwiki\\_debug.sh  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:57): and then use your ide to connect to it   \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:57): (it = the jvm started by the shell script)  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 10:57): the other solution (much harder) is to run xwiki inside eclipse  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 10:58): Running XWiki in Eclipse using SSL is really difficult...  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:00): vmassol: Are you sure, this is the right link? I can't find anything about remote debugging in this document.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:00): \\_steffen\\_: no it's not. this link is about installing xwiki sources in elcipse  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:00): for debugging: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Debugging  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:01): check the Remote Debugging section  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:02): vmassol: I've passed the options to tomcat. The debug \"session\" is running on port 5005. I can connect to this.  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:08): vmassol: I've deleted everything and start again. It will take some time to set all up again.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:09): \\_steffen\\_: ok  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:09): I'll be here all day  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:10): ok.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:14): \\_steffen\\_: one thing that would be great is if you can provide feedback on the new Admin UI that we've just released in 1.5M2  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:15): i.e. whether you like or not, what you think should be improved if need be, etc  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:15): since this is brand new we're looking for feedback   \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:15): we also have some time to adjust it for 1.5RC1  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:25): vmassol: As soon as 1.5m2 is released and running, I will have a look at it and give feedback. Is there a place where this feedback should be placed?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:25): \\_steffen\\_: mailing list is best  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:36): vmassol: sorry was in a call   \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:36): \\_steffen\\_: about \"secure\" http://manager.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/EditWiki  \nxwikibot - (25/06/2008 11:36): XWiki.smartech was modified by XWiki.smartech (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/smartech  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:37): it is just used where you seen it I think: to decide to generate http or https links  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:38): \\_steffen\\_: for debugging in Eclipse did you looked at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DebugXEWithEclipse ?  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:39): and especially at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DebugXEWithEclipse\\_Troubleshoots#HMyEclipsecan27tstopcrashing for your Eclipse crash  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:48): thomasmortagne: Is there a \"secure\" flag in single wiki mode?  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:48): thomasmortagne: Because XWiki is creating wrong URLs.  \nphirox - (25/06/2008 11:51): I renamed a page with a \"/\" in it, like x/test, now I cannot access it or rename it. Is there some way to solve this?  \nphirox - (25/06/2008 11:52): firefox does try to access it using url encoding(%2F) btw  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:52): \\_steffen\\_: no \"secure\" is only used in multiwiki mode I think  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 11:53): phirox: I think you're stuck since this is a bug we have currently with / in page names. The solution is to delete if in the database but that's not easy and dangerous if you make a mistake  \nphirox - (25/06/2008 11:54): vmassol: I was afraid so, but I'll dive into the database then. thanks  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:55): thomasmortagne: ok. So, using xwiki in multiwiki mode and setting up one wiki for usage and, if needed, one as a 'I'm just here and have nothing todo'-wiki could resolve my problem?  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:57): \\_steffen\\_: you don't even need the \"'I'm just here and have nothing todo\", you could simply set virtual=1 and configure a XWiki.XWikiServerXwiki with a XWiki.XWikiServerClass object enabling \"secure\" and externals URL should be correctly generated I think  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:58): but I'm not sure it's THE solution  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:58): thomasmortagne: Well. I will try and report.  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:58): what I don't understand is that in non multiwiki mode generated URLs should be relative  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:59): For sure, this isn't THE solution. The right way to go is, fixing URLs in XWiki. But as a workaround it's ok for me, if it's working.  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 11:59): yes sure  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 11:59): thomasmortagne: Don't understand what you mean.  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:00): in non multiwiki mode most of URL in the \"href\" should be /xwiki/bin/view/Space/Page and not http://host/xwiki/bin/view/Space/Page  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:01): so I don't understand why XWiki generate wrong http URLs  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:01): the problem is more here I think  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:02): as this (general relative URLs) used to work  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 12:02): thomasmortagne: Have a look at a bug report: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2502  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:03): is it a particular case of the redirect URL ?  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 12:04): I see such URLs only on xredirect's. The Sitemap-as-MindMap-thingie creates http://server.domain.tld:80/xwiki/...  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:04): \\_steffen\\_: anyway I seen you already discuss that in the mailing list/irc etc.. and there is a problem, I was just think in writing ;)  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 12:06): thomasmortagne: I hope to find a fix/workaround for this soon, becaue all my users complain on problems using XWiki. Disabling SSL encryption is a no-go for us.  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:06): I understand  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 12:06): So, hopefully multiwiki mode will work around this problem :)  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:07): yes I think it's possible unless redirect does not use URL factory  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 12:08): but if redirect isn't working URL factory, there is a chance to fix it, AFAIK redirect should use URL factory to build URLs...  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 12:09): At least this is my opinion :)  \nthomasmortagne - (25/06/2008 12:09): yes it should but I already seen some \"hand made\" URL in the past maybe some remains but I don't think so  \n\\_steffen\\_ - (25/06/2008 12:10): thomasmortagne: at least in macros.vm are URLs with hard-coded http in it.

I won't change documentation. I don't know about Oracle, but a colleague of mine does. He told me that when you create a user it already has all privileges over its schema, so that you don't need to grant anything. Besides, he found that 'grant all to user' non-sense also because there's no 'on [object]' clause. Take notice on this :)  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 23:01): I'd like to believe you but first I'd like confirmation that all works without the grant  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 23:01): could you confirm?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 23:02): do you have a reference to the oracle documentation on this (that would help)?  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 23:02): thanks  \nRenatoSilva - (25/06/2008 23:03): vmassol: we don't know what exactly grant all to xwiki means, but I guess it operates over the xwiki schema only doing what was already done with the creation of the user, so that the command is only a redundancy, this could be why it worked for all the other oracle users. The fact is that we are afraid this command to grat all privileges over the whole oracle instance, though I don't think so.  \nRenatoSilva - (25/06/2008 23:04): vmassol: I wikk confirm if it works withouth the command and then I'll tell you  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 23:04): ok thanks  \nRenatoSilva - (25/06/2008 23:05): We're testing XWiki and MoinMoin and deciding between them.  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 23:07): ok would be interested to hear about your criteria of choice and the result, even if you pick moinmoin  \nvmassol - (25/06/2008 23:07): feel free to ask questions on the list  \nRenatoSilva - (25/06/2008 23:07): vmassol: thank you  \n\n"}
