(14:16): great  \njvelociter - (14:17): which AS ?  \njvelociter - (14:17): the main wiki ?  \nvmassol - (14:17): on dashboard for ex  \nvmassol - (14:17): yes  \nvmassol - (14:17): main wiki  \nevalica -

(14:18): evalica: cool, let's do it  \njvelociter - (14:18): evalica: nice  \nvmassol - (14:18): evalica: we can refine later if need be  \njvelociter - (14:19): should we continue to advertise xeclipse and watch on the home page ?  \njvelociter - (14:19): I'm not sure  \nevalica - (14:19): jvelociter: we have lots of pages with them  \nvmassol - (14:19): jvelociter: yes indeed we shouldn't probably  \nevalica - (14:19): that's why I added them ...  \nevalica - (14:19): and they are found also in the quick links  \nvmassol - (14:19): indeed  \njvelociter - (14:19): yes but they are dead/dormant projects  \nevalica - (14:19): and Florin works on office  \njvelociter - (14:20): I did not say xoffice  \nevalica - (14:20): and this is org .. not com  \nvmassol - (14:20): so we could mention on their home page that they are not active  \nevalica - (14:20): aaa watch  \nvmassol - (14:20): clearly  \nevalica - (14:20): anyway .. keep them :P  \nevalica - (14:20): they look nice 6 :P  \njvelociter - (14:20): vmassol: then remove them from the block too  \njvelociter - (14:20): 4 would work  \nvmassol - (14:20): jvelociter: I'm fine in the blocks  \nvmassol - (14:20): it's normal that they are there  \njvelociter - (14:20): well I don't find it coherent  \nvmassol - (14:20): at least till we completely remove them  \nvmassol - (14:20): they're not removed  \nvmassol - (14:20): they're still top level projects  \njvelociter - (14:21): you advertise on \u00a0the home page but then say they are not active  \nvmassol - (14:21): and it's good people sees them  \nvmassol - (14:21): they may want to contribute to them  \njvelociter - (14:21): well then let's put back workspaces;)\u001c  \nvmassol - (14:21): what's important is that their status is very clear  \nvmassol - (14:21): no we've remove worskpaces  \nvmassol - (14:21): it's no longer in svn nor in jira  \njvelociter - (14:21): (ok, it's not a TLP anomore)  \njvelociter - (14:21): yes  \njvelociter - (14:21): I know  \njvelociter - (14:22): vmassol: then we can tag them as inactive on the home page  \njvelociter - (14:22): just an idea  \nvmassol - (14:22): yes I'm fine with that too  \nvmassol - (14:22): but at least they need to be tagged as \"inactive\" on their home page  \nevalica - (14:22): can someone give me edit rights?  \nvmassol - (14:22): since people can arrive directly on their home  \nvmassol - (14:22): evalica: doing it now  \nevalica - (14:22): thanks  \nsdumitriu - (14:23): Is someone upgrading myxwiki already?  \nevalica - (14:23): jv I think  \nvmassol - (14:23): jvelociter: there's an ugly pre in the admin page: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences  \nvmassol - (14:23): ;)  \njvelociter - (14:23): vmassol: yes I've seen that  \njvelociter - (14:23): what's strange is that it does not appear on other wikis  \njvelociter - (14:23): mmh  \njvdrean - (14:23): evalica: no not upgraded  \njvelociter - (14:23): maybe I know  \nsdumitriu - (14:24): jvdrean: I'll do it  \njvdrean - (14:24): XWikiPreferences must be converted to xwiki/2.0  \njvdrean - (14:24): (jvelociter)  \njvelociter - (14:24): ah  \nvmassol - (14:24): ok converting it  \njvelociter - (14:25): ok  \nsdumitriu - (14:25): 2.6-SNAPSHOT.${buildNumber} -> You should fix this  \njvdrean - (14:25): the page must not be converted automatically  \njvdrean - (14:26): because in this case all the textarea props are converted  \njvdrean - (14:26): and some html/velocity that is included in the templates are surrounded with {{html}}  \njvdrean - (14:26): (which is a problem when included from the templates)  \nvmassol - (14:27): done woroks better thanks jvdrean  \nsburjan` left at 14:29 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsburjan` joined #xwiki at 14:29  \nvmassol -

(14:50): mflorea: This is caused by your change  \nevalica - (14:50): I think florea put in style.css  \nevalica - (14:50): the relative path  \nsdumitriu - (14:51): getSkinFile doesn't see the ?skin=colibri parameter  \nvmassol -

(14:52): mflorea: bin/view/Some/Document?skin=colibri  \njvelociter - (14:52): we need to do that on all DBs, I gues ?  \nsdumitriu - (14:52): This asks for style.css from the colibri skin  \nsdumitriu - (14:52): jvelociter: Yes  \nsdumitriu - (14:52): jvelociter: No  \nsdumitriu - (14:52): jvelociter: Only the main database stores events  \njvelociter - (14:52): now you puzzled me  \njvelociter - (14:52): ah OK  \njvelociter -

(14:55): sdumitriu: but if we set the main skin to have the base skin colibri, is gonna be ok right? but toucan will be broken then  \njvelociter - (14:55): thanks  \nevalica - (14:55): and we want to make this change, right?  \nsdumitriu - (14:55): evalica: Yes  \nevalica - (14:55): k  \nvmassol - (14:56): jvelociter: I don't know this macro: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/RemoteCodeMacro Is it on code.xwiki.org?

Why do we access bin/skin/skins/colibri/style.css if the current skin is not colibri?  \nevalica - (15:01): to test how it look on colibri - using the param ?skin=colibri  \nsdumitriu - (15:01): mflorea: Because it was requested in the URL  \nsdumitriu - (15:02): bin/view/Main/WebHome?skin=colibri  \njvelociter - (15:02): vmassol: now it's used  \njvelociter - (15:02): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/ConfirmationBox  \nsdumitriu - (15:02): This is a classic way of previewing a skin  \njvelociter - (15:02): it's a useful macro I think  \njvelociter - (15:02): we should keep it  \nvmassol - (15:02): ok  \ntmortagne - (15:02): what i find weir is that AFAIK skin=colibri is supposed to change the current skin  \nvmassol - (15:02): I'm just saying the same thing jvelociter  \nvmassol - (15:02): ie we should publihs it on code.xwiki.org  \njvelociter - (15:02): yes we could publish it too  \njvelociter - (15:03): I don't know why I did not  \njvelociter - (15:03): maybe because it's too painful :D  \nmflorea - (15:03): sdumitriu: ok, understood. And there's no way to pass the skin URL parameter to the getSkinFile?  \njvelociter - (15:03): doing it now  \nvmassol - (15:04): jvelociter: let us know when you've set the indexe  \nvmassol - (15:04): indexes  \nvmassol - (15:04): I cannot display the Dadhboard page right now  \nvmassol - (15:04): taking too long  \njvelociter - (15:04): indexes are set  \nvmassol - (15:04): xwiki.org is real slow  \nevalica - (15:05): I know ...  \nvmassol - (15:05): brb  \nevalica - (15:05): I can upload the color theme on the import .... still tring  \njvelociter - (15:06): there are some stuck queries  \njvelociter - (15:06): let me kill them  \nsdumitriu - (15:06): mflorea: No, no way  \nsdumitriu - (15:06): mflorea: Unless we change getSkinFile to pass along URL parameters  \nsdumitriu - (15:06): Which would be actually very nice since it would allow previewing color themes as well  \nsdumitriu - (15:07): But there's no quick fix to use right now, without changing Java code  \nsdumitriu - (15:09): mflorea: + \u00a0overflow: visible; \u00a0-> don't you need to also change this for hx span?  \nmflorea - (15:10): sdumitriu: hx span doesn't have it colibri, and I don't thin it causes issues when on span  \nsdumitriu - (15:10): mflorea: Are you sure it's not in colibri? I saw it yesterday  \nevalica - (15:11): mflorea: sdumitriu now the ?skin=colibri works  \nevalica - (15:11): if the base skin is colibri - so it wasn't tested if base skin is toucan  \nmflorea - (15:11): sdumitriu: I just checked on colibri.css trunk  \nmflorea - (15:12): sdumitriu: what about storing the skin name in the cookie when skin=skinName is use in the URL, like it happens with the language. It will affect only you (not the rest of the users) and you can always revert to the previous skin.
