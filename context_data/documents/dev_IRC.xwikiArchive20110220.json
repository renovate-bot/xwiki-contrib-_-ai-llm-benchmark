I understand we tried to get a sponsorship but were not chosen as we have been sponsored a few years prior.  \n10:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*last year  \n10:33\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0I see.  \n10:34\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I have not heard any talk about applying this year although I suspect it will happen.  \n10:34\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0It'd be great if XWiki participate this year.  \n10:35\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0but does gsoc needs \\*sponsoring\\*?  \n10:35\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0google gives $500 to the organisation, right?  \n10:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0heh I don't even know how that works. I understand google gives something to the project.  \n10:36\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0:)  \n10:37\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0AFAIK, a set of contributors willing to mentor and a program administrator and a good application will be enough!  \n10:38\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0I saw that XWiki didn't participate last year, but was there in the last 3 years. so curious to know how would this year will be  \n10:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think last year, google decided to fund other projects instead.  \n10:40\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0ahh, ok. seems that's what you meant previously too, sorry I misunderstood!  \n10:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://cjdns.pastebay.com/114933  \n10:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Looking for comments on my proposed change to the DHT protocol :)  \n10:43\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0s/kasunbg/kasun/  \n10:45\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0has quit  \n10:50\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has quit  \n10:52\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:56\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n11:03\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:01\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has quit  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:34\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:54\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0mflorea: is there a way to stop the loading of a page inside an iframe? I'm using an iframe to include another page inside a html document, but I don't want the user to click on a link inside the iframe and that iframe portion be replaced with the clicked site (in a normal manner the whole page is replaced, not just the iframe part)  \n14:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0evalica: I think the best approach is to listen to the click event on the iframe.contentWindow and stop it (always or just when the target is a link). Otherwise you can stop a window (so including iframe.contentWindow) with window.stop() on most browsers and window.document.execCommand('stop', null) on IE  \n14:42\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0and without JS? target=\"\\_blank\" is not w3c valid and is not doing what I need  \n14:43\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0TARGET = \"\\_blank\" | \"\\_parent\" | \"\\_self\" | \"\\_top\" | window name  \n14:43\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/linking/\\_A\\_TARGET\\_95y116y111y112y.html  \n14:43\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0I'll use this .. but is not valid ... thanks mflorea - JS is not an option :P  \n14:43\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0evalica: but how do you insert the \\_top?  \n14:44\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0<a target=\"\\_top\"  \n14:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0do you control the page that is loaded in the iframe?  \n14:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I mean the page content  \n14:44\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0I'm writing it  \n14:44\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0:)  \n14:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, in this case it should work  \n14:44\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0yea... thanks a lot  \n14:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0np :)  \n14:48\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has quit  \n15:42\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n16:50\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:15\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:18\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has quit  \n17:20\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n17:51\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:12\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:17\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:46\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:06\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
