i need to allow access to attachment, but with some kind of authentication (url token, basic authentication), since filename can be determined (filename is the same across subwikis)  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0not sure I understand the question, you have right check to know if you have view right on the page containing the velocity and then you also have right check in all public APIS used by the velocity code  \n15:19\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n15:20\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has quit  \n15:23\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne1: well, the file is calendar data (ics), since several calendar clients allows remote file source (http, for auto-synchronizing), i need to allow access to this file for unauthorized users (since you cannot simulate web login only with url), so i figured out two options -> 1) basic authentication (http://user:pass@wiki/attachment), or some url token (?token=qwerty), but i'm not sure if setting that as velocity script executes on attachment requ  \n15:25\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ok, so there is basic auth fallback :)  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0yes basic auth exist in XWiki  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0if guest does not have access you should get a basi auth challenge  \n15:30\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep, basicauth=1  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0you can also directly login with preventive basic auth without that basicauth=1 parameter, that's whats EM do to access extensions.xwiki.org  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0\\*preemptive  \n15:32\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep, thanks  \n15:32\u00a0<DSpair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:32\u00a0<ClemensR1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:38\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n15:38\u00a0<DSpair>\u00a0is now known as <D-Spair>  \n15:43\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:07\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:09\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: ping. could you give me rights to assign myself issues in the XACTIVITI project ?
