Is there a tip for the following use case : I'm editing a long document/section in wiki mode. When I hit preview then \"back to edit\", I'm redirected to the top of the doc/section and have to seek for the line I was editing. It there an extension to remember the edit line ?  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Hi martinus\\_\\_, not that I know of, would be nice to have this by default. IMO you should open a jira issue (I don't remember seeing one)  \n10:27\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, great thanks  \n10:33\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13769 ;)  \n10:33\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ok, the bot handles it  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n10:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:50\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:10\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0Morning folks  \n12:15\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0Anyone know which versions of tomcat are supposed to be valid right now for the 8.x release of xwiki? \u00a07.0.54, 8.0.33, 8.5.0, and 8.5.4 all had issues. \u00a07.0.54 had the jar annotations storm, the 8.x versions all suffered the %2F bug thing. \u00a0But the tomcat page seems to indicate that 8.0.33 and 8.5.0 should have worked...  \n12:29\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0vmassol: ^^  \n12:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0daemoen: see note here: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationTomcat \u00a0\u00a08.0.33 should be working  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks ClemensR  \n12:42\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0ClemensR: I know what it's supposed to do...
