Thus any module that goes in the platform war can also be referenced by some top level project and could be duplicated. We need to solve this generically since we cannot use \"provided\" deps everywhere in platform, especially since its not correct. I have the feeling that one solution is to remove the platform war dis  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/top level modules/top level projects/  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this makes sense since we agree we don't have a notion of core  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/agree/agreed/  \n10:52\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:53\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: OK for me  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll make a proposal  \n10:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So, platform-web becomes just a collection of files  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can separate it in 2 as we had planned  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one for resources and one for templates  \n10:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or we keep it as one)  \n10:58\u00a0<arkub\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<arkub\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sent  \n11:08\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:14\u00a0<rousseau>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: would be good if you could have a look at the mail vote  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/mail vote/vote mail/  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then if we agree about it we need to decide when to implement it.

There are a lit of tests which I have never seen testing code which I have not seen so it's going slowly for me and any help would be great.  \n12:06\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Anyway I think that takes precident over the vote  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we need to fix the tests.
