I spent some time working on developing a js/css server but I didn't really want to press on until the new model for actions was done.  \ncjdelisle` - (01:17): Then nobody knows how to make actions work with portlets and servlets and depending on servlets is a -1 so that's blocked until further notice.  \nsdumitriu - (01:17): Indeed  \ncjdelisle` - (01:41): hey, someone should commit and make some test regressions. I have the regression alert mailer pointed at my address and I'm waiting to get a couple messages before I point it at the notification list.  \ncjdelisle` - (01:41): ;)  \njvelociter - (01:42): hmmm what could we break ?  \njvelociter - (01:43): what about xwiki#getDocument ?  \njvelociter - (01:43): :)  \ncjdelisle` - (01:43): noone needs that for anything.  \nsdumitriu left at 01:44 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nSvenDowideit left at 02:46 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 02:50  \nabusenius left at 04:07 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nspliffy left at 04:37 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nspliffy joined #xwiki at 04:38  \njbrBridge left at 06:57 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \ncjdelisle` left at 06:59 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \njbrBridge joined #xwiki at 07:04  \ncjdelisle joined #xwiki at 07:04  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 08:33  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 09:03  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 11:09  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 11:52  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 12:03  \nlucaa left at 12:05 (Client Quit  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 12:40  \nlucaa left at 12:42 (Client Quit  \nrrodriguez left at 13:03 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 13:04  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 13:05  \nabusenius - (13:15): cjdelisle: would be coll if your reporting tool would detect the \"Address already in use\" exception and warn about it  \nabusenius - (13:15): or even better, kill whatever is blocking it :)  \nabusenius - (13:15): s/coll/cool/  \njvelociter left at 13:16 (Remote host closed the connection  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 13:16  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 14:30  \nc4h\\_kali joined #xwiki at 14:59  \nc4h\\_kali left #xwiki at 14:59  \nsabageru joined #xwiki at 15:15  \nmflorea1 joined #xwiki at 16:46  \nmflorea1 left at 16:46 (Client Quit  \nmflorea left at 16:46 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nsabageru1 joined #xwiki at 17:27  \nsabageru left at 17:29 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nvmassol left at 17:48 (Quit: Leaving.  \nEnygma` left at 18:21 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 18:42  \nrrodriguez left at 19:12 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 19:13  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 19:14  \ntmortagne left at 19:14 (Client Quit  \nfmancinelli - (19:26): Quick question: in a velocity script is there a way for creating instances of java.net.URI ?  \nsabageru1 left at 19:31 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nfmancinelli - (19:39): And another one: if I have a string \"xwiki:Space.Name\" how can I get the URL corresponding to the page? (always in a velocity script)  \nfmancinelli - (20:08): ok, for the second one I used the deprecated method $xwiki.getURL(\"xwiki:Space.Name\", \"view\")  \nvmassol - (20:22): fmancinelli: why do you need URI?  \nvmassol - (20:22): normally apis for velocity shouldn't require uri  \nvmassol - (20:22): (at least that's one way of solving it)  \nvmassol - (20:23): (now the question is whether we want all script service apis to not have uri thus potentially penalizing other scripting language - we'll need to solve this at some point, probably with type transformer uberspectors)  \nfmancinelli - (20:31): I need it for passing a URI to a function (that is not part of the xwiki API)  \nvmassol - (20:31): fmancinelli: so you could accept a string instead of a uri maybe?  \nvmassol - (20:31): (or put a velocity tool in the velocity context)  \nfmancinelli - (20:36): yes, maybe I'll put a tool in the context  \nfmancinelli - (20:36): thanks  \nvmassol - (20:37): you could use a Velocity listener for that  \nvmassol - (20:37): (fmancinelli)  \nvmassol - (20:37): in order to not have to modify the configuration file  \nvmassol - (20:38): VelocityContextInitializer  \nfmancinelli - (20:39): ok  \nvmassol - (20:39): got to go, bye  \nvmassol left at 20:39 (Quit: Leaving.  \ncjdelisle left at 20:57 (Quit: look for a less laggy server  \ncjdelisle` joined #xwiki at 20:58  \njbrBridge - (21:00): [[[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)] Where can I find this xwikibot? I would like to include it in my site :-)  \ncjdelisle` - (21:02): Here is a copy of it built http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/applications/xwiki-application-ircbot/  \ncjdelisle` - (21:02): it will take some effort to get it to work though, it was designed to be used in house only.  \ncjdelisle` - (21:04): It might be worth considering including the bot in XE by default. If xwiki.org needs it and you need it then there is obvious need.  \nsburjan` - (21:10): cjdelisle`: who coded the bot ?  \ncjdelisle` - (21:10): vmassol  \nsburjan` - (21:10): and do you have any idea how the events are transmitted to the bot ?  \njbrBridge - (21:10): [[[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)] I think it ist helpful monitoring content changes on a website.  \njbrBridge - (21:10): [[[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)] But I would prefer to use a jabber conference room. It would give a better control who have access without restrict it to  \njbrBridge - (21:11): [[[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)] use it only in an intranet.  \ncjdelisle` - (21:11): the bot is based on pircbot.  \ncjdelisle` - (21:12): I think anything which can be done in jabber can also be done in irc.  \nsburjan` - (21:12): yes..  \nsburjan` - (21:12): but how does it actually communicate with XE ?  \ncjdelisle` - (21:12): And my little rant: the jabber server has less stability than my desktop (this is before I started using ipredator mind you)  \ncjdelisle` - (21:13): IRC is a more solid protocol for whatever reason.  \nsburjan` - (21:14): well.. it was used by the DoD :)  \nsburjan` - (21:14): it's a solid protocol, that's why I like ircing  \ncjdelisle` - (21:14): If you want to make the bot available to jabber, you can use a bridge like ircBridge/jbrBridge  \ncjdelisle` - (21:15): That bridge is a perl program called jirc. Written by kevin kees IIRC.  \ncjdelisle` - (21:15): s/kees/cook/  \ncjdelisle` - (21:15): I think...  \ncjdelisle` - (21:16): kees cook.  \ncjdelisle` - (21:16): lol fail  \ncjdelisle` - (21:16): http://outflux.net/software/pkgs/jirc-bridge/  \ncjdelisle` - (21:17): So if you only use jabber then you can drop a ratbox on localhost and connect the bot to it and a jirc instance and it will bounce to jabber.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 21:45  \njvelociter\\_ joined #xwiki at 21:53  \njvelociter left at 21:57 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \njvelociter\\_ is now known as jvelociter ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nvmassol left at 22:21 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsabageru joined #xwiki at 22:41  \nfmancinelli left at 22:47 (Quit: Leaving.  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 22:47  \nArcainus left at 22:50 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nsabageru left at 22:53 (Quit: Leaving.  \nfmancinelli left at 22:58 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \nArcainus joined #xwiki at 23:19  \nrrodriguez left at 23:41 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \n\n"}
