Any idea why ? I added one on the main page  \ncjdelisle - (14:03): So start by looking at your iptables and if that's good then look toward your host.  \nbblfish - (14:04): yes, I tried ping from the uk abovenet  \nbblfish - (14:04): also works  \ncjdelisle - (14:04): sburjan, XWIKI-4400  \nbblfish - (14:05): but it's a bit weird how iptables could mess something up for only one host  \nsburjan - (14:05): I was just wondering how I manage to get these things that don't work.

At one point I was using this, now things go through the router  \nsburjan - (14:11): it's normal that not all routers respond to ping.

Classfull routing was a bad idea back then  \nsburjan - (15:20): and we are suffering now from that design  \nsburjan - (15:21): they'll never be able to fix this. I've heard about companies switching classes between them to get a continous group, and reduce framentations, but ...  \nsburjan - (15:21): \\*continuous  \ncjdelisle - (15:22): It's a flaw in the design, limited number of ips, people want to have as many as possible --> land rush --> exhaustion + deaggrigation.  \nsburjan - (15:22): yeah, Madonna bought land on the Moon. :))  \nsburjan - (15:22): everybody wants more that it needs  \ncjdelisle - (15:22): 2 routeable /24's are worth more than 1 /23, deaggrigation is the rule.  \ncjdelisle - (15:23): If your address was the same as the hash of your public key then there wouldn't be this mess but oh well...  \nsburjan - (15:23): ipv will allow fridges to have ip addresses too  \nsburjan - (15:23): \\*ipv6  \ncjdelisle - (15:23): Of course there would need to be a whole different routing system.  \ncjdelisle - (15:24): ip6 will fail for the same reasons but faster.  \nsburjan - (15:24): it's too late to fix this with ipv4  \nsburjan - (15:24): hoping all ipv4 address allocation will be continuous is an utopia.  \ncjdelisle - (15:24): They're handing out ip6 provider independent /64's to anyone with an AS#.  \ncjdelisle - (15:25): ip6 will fail before it gets off the ground.  \nsburjan - (15:25): anyway  \nsburjan - (15:26): I am not affected by this  \nsilviar left at 15:26 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsburjan - (15:26): larger routing tables, requires more powerful routing equipment, I'm not buying anything  \nsburjan - (15:26): it's not optimal, that's all  \ncjdelisle - (15:27): The future is multiple ip4 and ip6 networks where the nodes communicate across networks at the application level.  \nsburjan - (15:27): wdym application level ?  \nsburjan - (15:27): layer 7 ?  \ncjdelisle - (15:28): Bittorrent doesn't care if you're on ip4 or ip6, it'll find an intermediary to route the data to you.  \ncjdelisle - (15:28): Everything will be like that eventually.  \nsburjan - (15:29): well yes, but it's not the Bittorrent that actually searches for routes .. it's the router that does that  \nsburjan - (15:29): exterior link state routing protocols .. like BGP  \nsburjan - (15:29): or IS-IS  \ncjdelisle - (15:30): I'm just saying people will be connected to multiple networks and their applications will bounce data from one to another.  \nsburjan - (15:30): no, it's a vector path protocol  \ncjdelisle - (15:30): zebra.ovh.net <-- is this up for you?  \ncjdelisle - (15:30): I'm getting a RST packet from it.  \nsburjan - (15:31): uinable to connect  \nsburjan - (15:31): but are you afrait of routing loops, or what ?  \nvmassol - (15:31): but XWiki's ATG is not going to scale to the Star 7 level and this will cause the CVF to flow over the IUT!  \ncjdelisle - (15:31): hehe  \nvmassol - (15:31): :)  \nsburjan - (15:31): vmassol: didn;t understand a thing :))  \nvmassol - (15:32): come on that's pretty basic stuff!  \ncjdelisle - (15:32): The job that the router does now will be done by the user's computer in 10 years.  \nsburjan - (15:34): cjdelisle: yes, assuming you have one physical cable to all the machines in internet :)  \ncjdelisle - (15:34): Nah, the routers still are there, they connect semi-internets and each user's computer connects to 3 or 4 semi-internets.  \ncjdelisle - (15:35): To save ip, what you do is layer it.  \nsburjan - (15:35): so what will be the use of an ISP, or a carrier ?  \nsburjan - (15:35): \\*role  \nvmassol - (15:35): mflorea: I need help on something.
