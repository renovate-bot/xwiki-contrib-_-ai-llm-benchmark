I dont have guarantees they will work okay, right ?  \nsburjan - (16:26): providing I don't use a template when creating the subwiki, instead importing 2.5 xar  \nsburjan - (16:26): anyway, this is the first time I tried XEM, it was about time  \nrrodriguez left at 16:27 (Quit: rrodriguez  \ntmortagne1 - (16:27): XEM and XE version are exactly the same  \ntmortagne1 - (16:28): XEM 2.4.3 is based on XE 2.4.3  \ntmortagne1 - (16:28): so a subwiki will need to be a 2.4.3  \nsburjan - (16:28): yes ...  \ntmortagne1 - (16:29): when you install XEM war you install XE war with some more jars so you have exactly the same constraints than with XE  \ntmortagne1 - (16:29): the framework is still the same, multiwiki is a feature of XE enabled in XEM  \nsburjan - (16:30): yes. and when creating subwikis .. if NOT using atemplate .. that \"deserted\" wiki .. is the platform, right ?  \nsburjan - (16:30): with no XE, no nothing  \ntmortagne1 - (16:31): an empty subwiki is exactly the same thing that you have with an empty standalone XE  \ntmortagne1 - (16:31): when you install XE war and don't have imported the xar yet  \nsburjan - (16:32): yes ..  \nsburjan - (16:33): that thing is still called XE, even if doesnt have the XE spaces and apps ? like ColorThemes space, Sandbox, etc  \nsburjan - (16:33): I'm trying to understand the distinction between these  \ntmortagne1 - (16:33): there is XE war and XE xar  \ntmortagne1 - (16:33): XE xar is pure XE things  \nsburjan - (16:33): yes  \nsburjan - (16:34): and the was is the platform/core  \ntmortagne1 - (16:34): XE war is what XE picked from the platform  \ntmortagne1 - (16:34): it's not THE platform  \ntmortagne1 - (16:34): it's what we choose to put in XE from the plugins/components/etc...  \nsburjan - (16:35): so what is the core/platform .. the lowest usable thing we have if we strip down everything we can ?  \ntmortagne1 - (16:35): the XE war is configured platform  \nsburjan - (16:36): yes.. well this is what I was saying too :)  \ntmortagne1 - (16:36): the platform is actually all you can find in http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/  \nsburjan - (16:36): XE war is the actual web app .. installed in java servlet container. and XE xar is only a collection of pages  \ntmortagne1 - (16:37): and XE decide which part of it it takes as it's default distribution  \ntmortagne1 - (16:37): yes  \nsburjan - (16:37): but the actual application, that makes a XE to be a real XE, is the XE.XAR  \ntmortagne1 - (16:38): yes that's what puts all the UI together  \ntmortagne1 - (16:38): with applications comming form the platform and XE specific pages to produce something that looks like a product  \ntmortagne1 - (16:39): XE is supposed to be just packaging  \ntmortagne1 - (16:39): ther is still lot's of XE specific pages but most of them will be move in applications at some point  \nsburjan - (16:39): I see  \nsburjan - (16:40): and basically all the subwiki's of a XEM use the same war file .. same platform/core  \ntmortagne1 - (16:40): yes  \ntmortagne1 - (16:40): it's \"virtual\" wikis, not real independents wikis  \nsburjan - (16:40): yes.  \ntmortagne1 - (16:40): like in a php/mysql hosting everyone use the same MySQL/php  \nsburjan - (16:41): and this virtual mode is related to what we were discussing on the mailing list ?  \ntmortagne1 - (16:41): not sure what you are refering to  \nsburjan - (16:42): users management in virtual mode  \nsburjan - (16:43): this is a new way to treat user hierarchy  \nsburjan - (16:43): in a XEM  \ntmortagne1 - (16:43): yes, the idea of a general configuration to indicate if you use only global users, local user or mixed  \ntmortagne1 - (16:44): but it's not really new, it's just that now we are in mixed mode  \nsburjan - (16:44): yeah  \ntmortagne1 - (16:44): we want to have a simple configuration to be able to force global or local mode  \ntmortagne1 - (16:44): for the whole farm  \nsburjan - (16:44): did we start the release .. or it will be postponed for tomorrow ?
