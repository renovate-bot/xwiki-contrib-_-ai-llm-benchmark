Quick question... Do we have an API for getting the \"pretty name\" of a user (e.g. his name and surname) ?  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: $xwiki.getUserName($userid, false) from velocity  \n15:59\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0thanks tmortagne  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: funny, it seems that when deploying XWiki on a CDI-enabled system, CDI is confused by our atinject annotations (cf email on the list)\u2026 will need to do some tests  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes I seen the weird errors, so this means that CDI scan the jars for all classes containing those annotations ?  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well normally no  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally you have to decalre a beans.xml in META-INF  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least in CDI 1.0  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably still true in 1.1  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now maybe Glassfish does some magic  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then I don't understand how it was able to find those classes  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea ATM  \n16:12\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0random note about my migration problem: seems that in ancient times (e.g. XWiki 2.1) rights in subwikis were stored with user references as wikiname:XWiki.UserName \u00a0instead of just \u00a0XWiki.UserName ... I guess if I update that in the DB, my problems go away  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mfmflorea: Hi, what's your status re XWIKI-9508 ?  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm getting worried that it's being pushed late when I believe it's the most important issue for SOLR in 5.3 ;) (also a hard one)  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: there is no reason the full reference does not work, putting a relative reference is just optimization  \n16:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n16:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it does not work you should report it since that would be a bug  \n16:15\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, the relative reference works well in the rights check, but it seems it does not work in the UI  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I would be suprised since global users are referenced with full reference (no other way)  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then that's definitely a bug  \n16:16\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ah, it should work even there, too - hm, not sure if it is worth reporting, as it only seems to happen when you migrate out of the late stone ages, so to say  \n16:17\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0and yes, it fully works for global users, which are references with the 'xwiki': \u00a0prefix  \n16:17\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0ok, if it is a bug, I better check the code instead of wondering how to migrate the data, thanks!  \n16:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: whatever possible migration issue, having a different behavior with relative and full reference is a bug IMO  \n16:21\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, I am looking into it if it is really a bug in the code or in front of the keyboard ;) \u00a0thanks for the pointer!  \n16:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you're welcome :)  \n16:29\u00a0<chalx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:29\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0tmortagne: the UI greps the user reference from the \"users\" property (which is a \"long string\"), like: \u00a0$pers.matches(\"^(.\\*,)?${regextool.quote($username)}(,.\\*)?$\") \u00a0\u00a0($pers being the value of the XWikiGlobalRights 'users' property, $username the non-prefixed user name for every user in the table) ... thats why it does not find my users \u00a0which are redudantly prefixed \u00a0(in /templates/getusersandgroups.vm) ... I guess it \"breaking through the abstraction\" o  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0camil7: I see, so the UI is a bit dumb  \n16:32\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it could be nice if you could report it on jira, sounds like a easy candidate for next Bug Fixing Day ;)  \n16:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless it's been fixed in more recent version but I don't remember commits in that area  \n16:34\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0yes, ok, I will write a bug report; maybe even with a patch, except that all what I can think of is .. a bit ugly ;)  \n16:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at worst it will be good inspiration anyway if it's to ugly ;)  \n16:48\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0vmassol: wanna invite me back into the skype dev chat? I just typed /window close in the wrong window and my setup doesn't actually have a way to get it back  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahah  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n16:49\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0I really ought to filter commands that I'm not supposed to be sending to that server because it mostly works as long as I don't touch anything  \n17:03\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys have I sent a proposal to delay the 5.3 release on the devs list?
