Not sure if this is what you want.  \nxwiki-bridge - (07:24): [Lady Serena Kitty] I know, but I want the bars to be horizontal.  \nxwiki-bridge - (07:25): [Lady Serena Kitty] looks like even with the old chart macro, I can't get them to be horizontal  \nxwiki-bridge - (07:27): [asirir] checking  \nxwiki-bridge - (07:32): [Lady Serena Kitty] I looked in the sources, and the constants for the different renderers are there, they just aren't bound  \nxwiki-bridge - (07:34): [asirir] yup, seems not possible.  \nxwiki-bridge - (07:43): [Cindy Mitchell] o.o \u00a0Jessica, we're going to be using those for what, our stats and stuff?  \nxwiki-bridge - (07:44): [Lady Serena Kitty] http://admin.ladyserenakitty.com/bin/ServerFund  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 08:15  \nLadySerena joined #xwiki at 08:32  \nxwiki-bridge - (08:51): [Cindy Mitchell] How can I find out which groups a user is in?  \nxwiki-bridge - (08:54): [Vincent Massol] Cindy Mitchell: hi. I don't think you can right now or at least not easily. I'm not sure though since I don't know that part well. What you can do is test whether a user a right to do something though  \nxwiki-bridge - (08:55): [Cindy Mitchell] Ah.  \nxwiki-bridge - (08:55): [Vincent Massol] you could ask on the list and get a better answer though  \nxwiki-bridge - (08:55): [Vincent Massol] bb in 2 minutes  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 09:02  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 09:03  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:03): [Cindy Mitchell] I found it.  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:03): [Cindy Mitchell] $xwiki.user.isUserInGroup()  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:04): [Vincent Massol] yes but that's different from what you were asking  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:04): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:04): [Vincent Massol] if it fills your need then good though  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:04): [Cindy Mitchell] yeah, well I just changed what I wanted. :P  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:33): [Vincent Massol] silviar: hi  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:34): [Vincent Massol] re manual testing plan, we need to decide if we want to duplicate automated testing or not IMO  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:35): [Vincent Massol] hmm since you have different browsers and since our automated tests are not done on all browsers yes I'd propose that we mention in the manual test plan when an automated test exist in the cell  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:35): [Vincent Massol] wdyt?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Vincent Massol] for ex on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/TestingRegisterLoginLogout, you could fill some cells under FF with \"AT\" or some image (AT would stand for Automated Test)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Vincent Massol] I think it's important to know where we have automated tests already  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:36): [Vincent Massol] for 2 reasons:  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Vincent Massol] 1) it allows to see where we don't have automated tests and thus let us create more automated tests  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Vincent Massol] 2) it makes manual tests faster since we don't need to retest those  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:37): [Vincent Massol] wdyt?  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 09:40  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [Vincent Massol] silviar: also fyi the tests for register are here: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/trunk/distribution-test/selenium-tests/src/test/it/com/xpn/xwiki/it/selenium/RegisterTest.java  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:40): [Vincent Massol] and the tests for login/logout: http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/enterprise/trunk/distribution-test/selenium-tests/src/test/it/com/xpn/xwiki/it/selenium/LoginLogoutTest.java  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:41): [Vincent Massol] another question: is the goal of the manual test plan to be comprehensive or to cover only important features and only happy cases for those?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:42): [silviar] Mentioning the automated tests sounds very good. This is will help prioritize  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [silviar] The manual test plan should cover the most important features; For further testing we could have another separate page where more advanced scenarios could be included  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [silviar] like Guillaume did here with the WYSIWYG  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:44): [silviar] http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/ManualTestPlan  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [silviar] \\*this will  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:45): [Vincent Massol] ok. Would be great if you could add those 2 points to the description of the manual test plan somewhere  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:46): [Vincent Massol] Point 1: about mentioning the automated tests  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:46): [Vincent Massol] Point 2: about the scope of the manual test plan  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:46): [Vincent Massol] maybe it's there already?  \narkub joined #xwiki at 09:46  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:46): [silviar] There is a mention of the scope of the test plan in the begining  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:46): [Vincent Massol] what's the link already?  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Vincent Massol] oh you just gave it :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Vincent Massol] hmm no  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [silviar] http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/ManualTestingPlan/  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Vincent Massol] this link http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/ManualTestPlan says the opposite  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [silviar] In there begining in italics  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:47): [Vincent Massol] ah there are 2 pages  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:48): [silviar] The first link was to give an idea as to how the comprehensive additional testing pages will look like  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:48): [silviar] the second is the draft for the basic testing  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:48): [silviar] with the mention of the scope in italics  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Vincent Massol] ok you'll need to refactor the 2 pages into one probably when you're done and move from draft to there  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Vincent Massol] there = Community space  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Vincent Massol] guillaume's page is probably now obsolete in some parts  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Vincent Massol] since it doesn't represent the full manual test plan but only some wysiwyg part  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [silviar] Yes. The plan is to 1) Finish the draft for the manual testing 2) Include mentions of the automated tests 3) Move the pages to the final documentation  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:49): [Vincent Massol] great  \nbbc581 joined #xwiki at 09:51  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:51): [silviar] Guillaume's page will be brought up to date and become a supbage of WYSIWYG testing  \nxwiki-bridge - (09:52): [Vincent Massol] ok  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 10:06  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 10:07  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:15): [Vincent Massol] bad doc name  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:15): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:15): [silviar] noticed :)  \nbbc581 left at 10:19 (Client Quit  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:20): [silviar] Should notifications for minor changes to docs on xwiki.org appear on jabber?  \nbbc581 joined #xwiki at 10:21  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:24): [Vincent Massol] silviar: it's a question I've asked myself but I answered yes when I coded the bot. The reason is that I thought it was nicer to see everything going on, someone could spam the wiki with minor notifications for ex, etc  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:25): [Vincent Massol] in some future what I'd like is to have a monitoring app  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:25): [Vincent Massol] in xeclipse for ex  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:25): [Vincent Massol] where you can choose which notifications you wish to receive  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:25): [Vincent Massol] (using distributed events)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:26): [Vincent Massol] so that you can follow whatever happens in the wiki in real time  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:26): [silviar] ok; I only asked because I don't want to spam the chat with the changes/additions I make  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:26): [Vincent Massol] when the level of \"spam\" will be too high we could have a special channel for notifications  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:26): [Vincent Massol] and only people interested would be on this channel  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:27): [silviar] sounds good  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 10:39  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:41): [Vincent Massol] almost done with my model references stuff\u2026. will be committing soon but the next step will be to review all places that manipulate references to ensure the code is ok and to ensure they use the new factories/serializer  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:42): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: ok with my last mail about relative vs absolute?  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:42): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: did not gone this far in Gmail yet, i'm looking  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:45): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: answered (+1)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:45): [Vincent Massol] pfeww\u2026.  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:45): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:46): [tmortagne] i was thinking it was becoming too complicated with relative references  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:46): [Vincent Massol] yep  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:47): [tmortagne] for Eclipse+ubuntu users: 3.6 works well and support better new version of GTK introduced by Ubuntu 9.10 (like bug with button impossible to click in Eclipse 3.5)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:48): [Vincent Massol] btw m2e is almost final  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:48): [Vincent Massol] haven't tried the latest dev build though  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:48): [tmortagne] works well too  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:48): [tmortagne] tested it with my new 3.6 install  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:49): [lucaa] tmortagne: good news. if only eclipse had a simpler way to upgrade...  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:49): [tmortagne] seems to not have issues I used to have with 0.9.9  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:50): [tmortagne] lucaa: yes even for the same version i regularly have to recreate Eclipse install  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:50): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: they say they've fixed the issue I reported with resource files not picked up (I've seen the jira issuec losed)  \nxwiki-bridge - (10:51): [tmortagne] Vincent Massol: great that was the main m2eclipse all versions issue  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:00): [Cindy Mitchell] I want news posts on the main page; is there a way I can pull in a post and parse it as news?   \nxwiki-bridge - (11:01): [sdumitriu] Pull it from where?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:01): [Cindy Mitchell] another wiki page  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:01): [sdumitriu] You mean something like the blog app?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:01): [sdumitriu] Sure it's possible  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:01): [sdumitriu] Anything is possible in XWiki  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:02): [Cindy Mitchell] I want like a hidden wiki page that contains \"front page\" posts which can be parsed and displayed as news articles.  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:02): [sdumitriu] As long as you code it  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:03): [Cindy Mitchell] well, not so much a blog  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:03): [Cindy Mitchell] I'm not looking for people to comment on the news :P  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:03): [Cindy Mitchell] I just want a way to display news without hard-coding it.  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:05): [Cindy Mitchell] hm  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:05): [sdumitriu] You can just write document names in a wiki page and do something like:  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:05): [sdumitriu] foreach line in xwiki.getDocument('Main.NewsIndex').content.split  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:05): [sdumitriu] \u00a0\u00a0{{include document=\"$line\"/}}  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:05): [sdumitriu] end  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:05): [Cindy Mitchell] hm  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:06): [Vincent Massol] you can also tag them with a \"news\" tag  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:07): [Vincent Massol] and then use the search api to find all pages with that news tag  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:07): [Vincent Massol] depends on your needs  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:09): [Cindy Mitchell] hm  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:11): [lucaa] Vincent Massol: re absolute vs relative, my usecase when I needed the parsing the in wysiwyg, was for the link plugin, namely for editing links. I needed to parse a link's target when editing (so that I set the current selection in the link dialogs) but needed to leave it unchanged in case the user doesn't edit it so i needed its original form. However, this can be implemented also without relative refs, I just  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:11): [lucaa] it might inspire another usecase  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:12): [Cindy Mitchell] how do I use the search api?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:12): [Vincent Massol] lucaa: yes you could save the original string in case it's not changed  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:13): [lucaa] Vincent Massol: yes, something like that. Basically i only need the original serialization as relative, not the reference object/model itself  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:14): [Vincent Massol] relative serailization already exists in my impl of the compact serializer  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:14): [lucaa] as relative or absolute or whatever was the original, i meant  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:15): [Cindy Mitchell] Can I theme the admin panel separately from the front page?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:15): [asirir] devs, did someone updage xhtml validity tests recently? in http://hudson.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/com.xpn.xwiki.products$xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/ I see failed tests from build #325 to #328 but no changes to code..  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:15): [Vincent Massol] as long as you don't absolutely require relatvie reference we're fine :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:15): [lucaa] no, I don't. I reimplement everything there anyway, so I don't really require anything :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:15): [Vincent Massol] :)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:16): [lucaa] it was just for the usecase  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:16): [lucaa] type of usecase,maybe there could be something similar, etc  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:18): [Cindy Mitchell] how do I create a Space in my wiki, when I don't have the admin menu up top?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:19): [lucaa] Cindy Mitchell: you create a page in that space, for example the space home: Space.WebHome  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:23): [Cindy Mitchell] Oh, just any page?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:24): [sdumitriu] Yep, any  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:24): [sdumitriu] There's no space entity  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:31): [Vincent Massol] hmmm it seems we have the use case where we would want to use the default factory (or normalizer) but only for space and page and not for the wiki part...  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:32): [Vincent Massol] tmortagne: is that a valid use case, wdyt?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:32): [Vincent Massol] for ex mariusF does this in the gwt service:  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:32): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0String newPageName = StringUtils.isEmpty(page) ? \"WebHome\" : clearXWikiName(page);  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:33): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0String newSpaceName = StringUtils.isEmpty(space) ? \"Main\" : clearXWikiName(space);  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:33): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0String newWikiName = StringUtils.isEmpty(wiki) ? getXWikiContext().getDatabase() : clearXWikiName(wiki);  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:33): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return new DocumentReference(newWikiName, newSpaceName, newPageName);  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:33): [Vincent Massol] I'm replacing it with the default normalizer  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:33): [Vincent Massol] but the default normalizer will use \"xwiki\" as the db name  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:33): [Vincent Massol] (or whatever it's been configured as)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:34): [tmortagne] there is code for the wiki in the code you pasted, i'm not sure to understand what is the issue exactly  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:35): [tmortagne] hmm you mean use \"default\" space and \"current\" wiki when normalize  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:35): [tmortagne] the mix ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:35): [Vincent Massol] yes  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:35): [Vincent Massol] right now I have only 2 normalizer/factories  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:35): [Vincent Massol] all default or all current  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:36): [Vincent Massol] I was wondernig if we need a new one  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:36): [Vincent Massol] (which would do a mix)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:36): [tmortagne] well this use case is weird, why are we doing that in GWT ?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:36): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0// Note: we use the default normalizer instead of the current normalizer because the execution context in which  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:36): [Vincent Massol] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0// this component is used doesn't have a current document.

 \nxwiki-bridge - (11:43): [sdumitriu] Making it hard to import an application in another wiki?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:44): [Vincent Massol] references?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:44): [Vincent Massol] the user writes the links  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:44): [sdumitriu] Yep, {{include document=\"xwiki:Blog.BlogCode\"/}}  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:44): [Vincent Massol] so the user decides what to use  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:44): [Vincent Massol] if you rename  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [Vincent Massol] the rename impl uses the compact serializer  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [Vincent Massol] which uses the shortest possible string reference  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [Vincent Massol] what's your use case?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [Vincent Massol] rename? something else?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:45): [sdumitriu] Using an include from the WISYWIG  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:46): [Vincent Massol] I don't know, anca would know  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:46): [sdumitriu] Writing a link from the WYSIWYG  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:46): [Vincent Massol] depends what serializer she uses  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:48): [sdumitriu] (11:33:07 AM) Vincent Massol: I'm replacing it with the default normalizer  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:48): [sdumitriu] (11:33:17 AM) Vincent Massol: but the default normalizer will use \"xwiki\" as the db name  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:48): [Vincent Massol] this is not about serialization  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:48): [Vincent Massol] it's about factory  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:48): [Vincent Massol] (the opposite)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [sdumitriu] I read that as \"whetever document references are created from GWT, they will be fully prefixed  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [sdumitriu] I read wrong?  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [Vincent Massol] internally we only have absolute refs  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [Vincent Massol] it's only the serializer used that then decide to print the full ref or a relative one  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:49): [Vincent Massol] yes you read wrong I think  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:50): [Vincent Massol] well you read correctly but only half of the story ;)  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:50): [Vincent Massol] document refs are indeed created as absolute   \nxwiki-bridge - (11:55): [Vincent Massol] sdumitriu: after I'm done with the commit we need to review all places manipulating references to ensure default/current are used properly and to ensure the new model api is used  \nxwiki-bridge - (11:56): [Vincent Massol] I'm pretty sure I'm introducing several issues  \nkibahop left #xwiki at 12:12  \nsunny\\_slls joined #xwiki at 13:06  \nbbc581 left at 13:17 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)  \nLukemon\\_ left at 13:21 (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)  \nLukemon\\_ joined #xwiki at 13:25  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:50): [sdumitriu] evalica: I did some commits introducing the color theme in existing UIs  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:50): [sdumitriu] You should check if the colors are OK  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:50): [sdumitriu] Since I replaced custom colors with standard ones  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:52): [evalica] sdumitriu: k  \nxwiki-bridge - (13:52): [evalica] sdumitriu: k  \nLukemon\\_ left at 13:56 (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:04): good evening xwiki-bridge sdumitriu  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:04): xwiki-bridge, http://pastebin.com/m3cc8c847  \nxwiki-bridge - (14:05): [Vincent Massol] sunny: his name is sdumitriu\u2026. not xwiki-bridge ;)  \nsunny\\_slls - (14:05): when i execute this program the output is no way ?

I had a few rename patches, I would have to double check the code.  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:18): [Vincent Massol] Caleb: \"XWIKI-1082: When renaming a page, also update the \"parent\" field of subpages\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:18): [Vincent Massol] I think using the compact seralizer would be best  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:19): [Vincent Massol] I'm going to do that, let me know if that's a pb  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:19): [Vincent Massol] you might have had a good reason for putting that note  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:19): [Vincent Massol] (but I don't see it)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:19): I have to look at it, I don't remember using any serializer or putting any note.

I didn't use a serializer because I wasn't aware that there was one. I made it use wiki:space.page because I didn't want to add the logic (Which I didn't know already existed.)  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:24): [Vincent Massol] ok  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:24): [Vincent Massol] so no good reason to force the display of wiki and space, right?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:24): No good reason. Just bad coding.  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:24): [Vincent Massol] ok cool  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:25): [Vincent Massol] fixed  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:25): I'm not sure but I think the forward links are not refactored when moving a page to a different space or wiki.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:26): I remember seeing a bug posted about it (sorry I don't remember the #)  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:26): [Vincent Massol] ok I'll check it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:26): I had todo listed it for \"some time in the future\" :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:27): Another question, where should I put a page for design of the Action and ActionManager?  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:27): [Vincent Massol] dev.xwiki.org, Design space  \nxwiki-bridge - (18:27): [Vincent Massol] http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:28): Thanks, I have a few use cases I'll put up.  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:14 (\"gone for food!\"  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:25): [Vincent Massol] getting closer\u2026. fixing a pb I have introduced with backlinks...  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:25): [Vincent Massol] one important change is that the compact serializer now doesn't print the space if it's the same as the space of the current document  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:25): [Vincent Massol] this is what was making the backlinks fail  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:26): [Vincent Massol] if you can think of other stuff it can affect please let me know  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:26): [Vincent Massol] sdumitriu: grrr another spam  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:28): [glerouge] I didn't do anything  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:28): [Vincent Massol] come on guillaume  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:28): [glerouge] xwikibot: you liar  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:28): [Vincent Massol] why have modified that group?  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:28): [glerouge] lol  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:30): Cross site scripting?  \nxwiki-bridge - (19:31): [Vincent Massol] no, bug  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (19:32): Ahhhh...
