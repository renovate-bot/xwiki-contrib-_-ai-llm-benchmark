 \n15:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0in the sub-wiki space  \n15:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does your group has edit right on the current document ? maybe the check is on current document instead of current space which would be a bug  \n15:11\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the WikiMananger space ?  \n15:11\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah something is wrong i think  \n15:11\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i mapped the group to an LDAP group  \n15:11\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0am i correct to assume that this should give me access to the sub-wiki, if i defined groups rights in that sub.wiki ?  \n15:11\u00a0<cpe>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:12\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0or does a user still have to register ?  \n15:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can check if your user is in the expected group  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and yes a user has to login for the membership to make updated  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't understand how you can test if you are not logged in  \n15:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, but no need to register for the subwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so the user is in the main wiki, but the group is in the subwiki ?  \n15:14\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR gets what i mean :)  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha you are talking about wiki module stuff  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all that does is adding the user is XWikiAllGroup of the subwiki  \n15:14\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: yeah the group is a global group, and in the subwiki i gave that global group view, comment and edit  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you don't care about that if you explicitely set the rights you need  \n15:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ist it possible \u00a0that you gave the right to a local group with the same name?  \n15:15\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it seems the user is not added automatically to that group  \n15:15\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0maybe ldap groups cache ?  \n15:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0does \"global group\" mean \"group \u00a0the main wiki\" or \"group in the subwiki\" ?  \n15:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: it's a group in the main wiki  \n15:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so when i am in the subwiki, i have to click on \"Global\" to see it  \n15:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, and the user is not in that group, if you check in the main wiki ?  \n15:16\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: what version of XWiki is this and you logged in subwiki or main wiki ?  \n15:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but the user is member of the LDAP group ?  \n15:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: 7.1.2 and i logged in main wiki, as i can't see the subwiki  \n15:17\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: yes  \n15:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you want to make sure users are authenticated on main wiki wherever you authenticate look at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/LDAPAuthenticationUseCases#HI27minamultiwikienvironmentandIwantmyLDAPuserstoregisteronlyonthemainwiki  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0otherwise the your user will be added to the subwiki group listed in your configuration  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and the user will be created i the subwiki which is probably not what you want anyway  \n15:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0can you try to login to the sub wiki directly with that user? even though the wiki is not listed  \n15:19\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you login on main wiki and your user is still not in the expected mapped group then I guess you will have enable debug log for LDAP  \n15:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0( http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication#HEnableLDAPdebuglog )  \n15:21\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0one sec  \n15:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0at this point, we don't have LDAP enabled on the sub-wikis  \n15:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i mean the application  \n15:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so i don't have that problem tmortagne  \n15:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: i'll try to login directly to the sub-wiki  \n15:27\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0You are not allowed to view this document or perform this action  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: well if you don't have LDAP then you issue is simply that you did not adde the user in the group then  \n15:27\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0but the group mapping should be automatic no?  \n15:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: here is a screencap from the LDAP config of the main wiki  \n15:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://i.imgur.com/pRAiQww.png  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand, if you don't have LDAP then LDAP is not going to apply the mapping  \n15:29\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0LDAP is in the main wiki  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok then  \n15:29\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0not in the subs  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway as you said you logged in on main wiki so that was no the issue  \n15:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should enabled debug log and see what you get  \n15:30\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0on which module? com.xpn.xwiki.plugin.ldap or LDAPAuthServiceImpl  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0everything listed in http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication#HEnableLDAPdebuglog  \n15:31\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i never find any doc when i search, and you guys paste stuff like it's christman  \n15:31\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0christmas\\*  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0easy when you write it :)  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0!find LDAP  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't remember IRC command  \n15:32\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0and the log is the tomcat log?  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0!search LDAP  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea not great result in this case  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the log is standard log so catalina.out by default yes  \n15:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0paff NullPointerException  \n15:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0beautiful  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0NullPointerException may be more a consequence than a cause  \n15:35\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0obviously nobody told me that the LDAP group on the GUI should a LDAP DN, and not just the group name...  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0could you paste your log in pastebing or something  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually it's not only DN  \n15:36\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://paste.ubuntu.com/12124786/  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but yes better put DN in the mapping  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it also support filter or organization unit)  \n15:37\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: so according to the log my group name is not what he expects  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should put DN  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0id is supported only as group member (since some LDAP groups contains id instead of DNs)  \n15:38\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0is that documented somehwere?  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki.cfg  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication which is a copy of xwiki.cfg  \n15:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0which i don't use since i use the GUI :D  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep the GUI does not give much information  \n15:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i see that now  \n15:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yep xwiki seems to have some doc that would have helped me  \n15:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0hahaha  \n15:39\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0-.-  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's supposed to do to request and stuff to help (never really used it myself)  \n15:40\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can use the id in a filter if you want  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but really you should use the complete DN at least for performances reason  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it won't need to search for it  \n15:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: Adding user [XWiki.test] to xwiki group [xWikiBioCore]  \n15:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0progress!  \n15:42\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: what's the difference between https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/xWikiBioCore and https://lcsb-wiki.uni.lu/xwiki/bin/view/Main/xWikiBioCore ?  \n15:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0because now i have two groups with the same name  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0two completely different pages  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0groups are supposed to go in XWiki space  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you indicated xWikiBioCore which it should be the complete name  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWiki.xWikiBioCore ?  \n15:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0aye caramba  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xWikiBioCore ended up resolved as Main.xWikiBioCore because Main is s the default space  \n15:44\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah ok, don't get yet fully how the xWiki system works :(  \n15:45\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah when it works, it's beautiful !  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the UI should help and constraint more but need someone to work on it...  \n15:46\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tell me Thomas, where can I tip you ? :)  \n15:46\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i've been bugging you since 5 months!  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0aha, best tip are contributions ;)  \n15:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ahah, you want me as a contributor? except submitting bugs and annoying you, what am i good for?  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0finding bugs is already contributing, there is lots of things listed on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Contributing that don't require coding skills like adding stuff on xwiki.org, answering question from others, translations, etc.  \n15:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:18\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: i have a last question for today, what is the best scripting option in xWiki and is there any doc on that?  \n16:18\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i tried some stuff yesterday in Velocity, but it was an epic fail  \n16:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Velocity is more templating that scripting, you have a bit of logic in it but it's more designed to generate UI, best advanced scripting option would be Groovy I think  \n16:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the limitation with Groovy is that it require programming right  \n16:19\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n16:19\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0for instance, i wanted to generate a list of wikis and sort them alphabetically and make them links  \n16:20\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0in velocity i could juste print the wikis, but sorting, pfff no way  \n16:20\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well for this use the sirting would not be done by Velocity by by standard Java APIs  \n16:21\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yeah i tried using $sorttool or what not  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think I would try to put this use case in Velocity myself but since we constraint ourself to do only Velocity in standard XE that would probably be more a reflex  \n16:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway if you have PR and you are sure nobody will break your pages then don't hesitate to use Groovy  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a real language and performances are better than Velocity  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the python or ruby macros works well too but python Java implementation is way slower and I don't have much experience with ruby (which is not included by default)  \n16:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ok we will investigate this a bit  \n16:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0only Admins have PR  \n16:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0we would just need a way to prevent people to edit pages that have code in them  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually even admin may not have PR  \n16:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0possibly via a seperate space?  \n16:26\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0in our config, they do ;)  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can simply setup your pages with PR script to not be editable by anyone else than admins  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or put all of them in a specific space protected like the XWiki space is  \n16:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yep, and then include them where needed  \n16:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there are quite a few groovy code snippet examples on e.x.o: \u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome#|t=extensions&p=1&l=30&s=doc.creationDate&d=desc&type=snippet  \n16:30\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0how do you set permissions for a single page?  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you need to be advanced user (in your profile) and then you get a menu when over Edit button in which you can edit rights  \n16:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0edit button -> access rights ?  \n16:31\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0omg lol  \n16:31\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0sorry i'm becoming more stupid as time advances  \n16:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0some more random links: \u00a0sorting lists \u00a0using your own comparators in groovy: \u00a0http://groovy-lang.org/groovy-dev-kit.html#\\_sorting  \n16:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0want sorting done in groovy, but rendering in velocity? \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Scripting#HSharevariablebetweenlanguages  \n16:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, now me should really go back and debug my nasty little local problem here instead ;)  \n16:35\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: yeah botha re fine with me  \n16:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:44\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0is there a way to rename a document ?  \n16:45\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR:  \n16:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Trefex: yes ;)  \n16:47\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0not the title, i mean the actual document name  \n16:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0$xwiki.renameDocument( $doc, $newName) \u00a0- see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/SRD/Navigation?xpage=embed  \n16:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0same in groovy, just leave out the '$' :)  \n16:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: mhhh wiki.renameDocument(doc, 'toto') doesn't work  \n16:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i'm sure i missed something :D  \n16:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0migth depend in what \"doc\" is - how to you get that one? can you check with println doc.isNew(); if you got the expected document and not a non-existing one?  \n16:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0also maybe \"toto\" -> \"Space.toto\"  \n16:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0doc.isNew() => false  \n16:59\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0well right now i do it in the document i want to rename, and simply do doc.getDocument() before i just tried doc  \n17:01\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: also, while i didn't get the groovy to work, there's a button to do it, when you're on the page  \n17:01\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/DocumentLifecycle#HMove2FRename  \n17:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, of course one can do it in the UI, \u00a0I just tougth you need to do it programatically  \n17:03\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: both  \n17:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and using \"doc\" in a script is a stupid habit of mine  \n17:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: is it not good ?  \n17:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it conflicts with the predefined variable of \"the current document\"; better define a new one like : \u00a0\u00a0docToMove = xwiki.getDocument(\"Space.PageName\")  \n17:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah gotcha  \n17:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, you probably do not want to move around the page in which the script is located itself  \n17:05\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0from the doc, it seems $doc.rename(\"space.toto\") would be the way to rename  \n17:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0everytime you view the page it moves to a new location, that would be fun  \n17:06\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, yes, I forgot about that option  \n17:06\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0that platform link you sent is worth gold  \n17:06\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0thanks for that :)  \n17:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I never need to bookmark the SRD page, because it is always in my browser history :)  \n17:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is linked in the developer documentation somewhere, however  \n17:09\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0truth, most useful thing we were still missing  \n17:09\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i think i finally feel comfortable to roll it out in production :)  \n17:09\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, good :)  \n17:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:36\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n17:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:36\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:50\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:57\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:25\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n22:55\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:59\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n23:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n23:57\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit\n"}
