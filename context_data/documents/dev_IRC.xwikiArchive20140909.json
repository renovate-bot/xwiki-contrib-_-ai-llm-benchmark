Only the initial solr + lucene threads make noise when deleting a wiki. After that, all other page access logs are ok  \n09:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so it`s better and enough, IMO, for the RC1  \n09:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: the log you have with \"the initial solr + lucene threads\" should not be related to localization  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0SOLR itself fail to load document it been asked to index  \n09:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0agreed. will create a new issue about that separately.  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think there is one  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not new  \n09:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0will do a quick search for it  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: I found what was the issue...  \n09:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0let me give you a link  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-watchlist/xwiki-platform-watchlist-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/WatchListTranslations.xml#L76  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this bundle is global  \n09:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which mean it's registered on the root CM, that's the one staying when the wiki is deleted (and the wiki CM cleaned)  \n09:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fixing it and thinking of a way to handle better this use case (in the rare case it's valid)  \n09:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so global bundles need to be removed as well in the event that their document or their wiki gets deleted (if they are not on the main wiki)  \n09:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we really need to fix the solr logs  \n09:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when xwiki is closed before solr gets to index or when a wiki is deleted before sorl indexes, etc  \n09:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0well, not the logs, but the index thread  \n10:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m getting solr logs in tests when the instance is closed after a test is done  \n10:01\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I think the escape tests pass locally  \n10:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Results :  \n10:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Tests run: 36, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 35  \n10:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0though it`s hard to read the logs with all the solr stuff in it  \n10:10\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n10:55\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: not sure about the escape tests.

 \n11:23\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:25\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok doing it and I'll revert if need be  \n12:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n12:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: I guess we`ll have(/be able) to update our Firefox version as well, if this Selenium version is ok.  \n12:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we're supposed to support the latest FF version indeed  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now we have 27 installed on agents  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the latest FF?  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I use chrome)  \n12:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0running 31.0 on my machine  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway let's not do everything at the same time ;) I suggest we release RC1 first  \n12:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0latest in 32  \n12:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see selenium 2.42.0 supports native events for FF28 only  \n12:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/in/is/  \n12:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe they did not changed since 28  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so apparently in the release notes there's no mention of anything newer than 28  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/CHANGELOG  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the past there was always a mention in the RN when native event support was added for a given FF version  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I wouldn't use a version newer than 28  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I even suggest we stay on 27 FTM  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0till the next release of selenium  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/about/platforms.jsp  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for the official support doc  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok same as release notes  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0RN are more precise actually  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but at least now we know the next version should work with more recent FF version  \n12:32\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: the escaping issues reproduce locally  \n12:57\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n13:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0hmm, on a better inspection on the templates that are failing the test it seems that they are indeed producing an empty result  \n13:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but that is just because of the way they are written  \n13:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it seems that these tests expect a result, but these templates (skins/flamingo/menus\\_macros.vm, skins/flamingo/menus\\_wiki.vm, skins/flamingo/menus\\_home.vm) simply produce none when taken outside their intended context (like these tests are doing)  \n13:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: wdyt, is it safe to ignore these failures and start the release already?  \n13:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I am not familiar with how escaping tests work, just making an idea now, as I go  \n13:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: what i'm wondering is why now ?  \n13:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm checking something  \n13:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this commit seems to have introduced this, yesterday: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/155151f145d5f80d0d511d4a4e83e07a7f73933e  \n13:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I may have an idea on that actually  \n13:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0by gdelhumeau  \n13:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I think they are ignored  \n13:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0maybe because they were in subdirectories  \n13:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just not the right ones  \n13:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0they were ignored, yes  \n13:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah  \n13:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau probably forgot the conf  \n13:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when he moved them  \n13:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes  \n13:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I'm sorry  \n13:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0where do you conf that?
