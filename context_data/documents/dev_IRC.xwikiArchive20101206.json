Those are download pages for which only the documentname has been precised inthe original extension page (instaead of the full name like Macro.MyMacroDownload) - I think mostly Ludovic was doing that. I have setup a quick fix UI at ExtensionCode.FixDownloads where you can pass original download pa  \njvelo - (20:57): ge and new extension page to fix it.  \njvelo - (20:57): vmassol, second issue is that it seems some page do now have proper bundled with info.

Do you think the problem happened when attachments were imported from an XAR?  \njvelo - (21:45): cjdelisle`, it seems it happened only for a couple of documents, probably at a time xwiki.org was hanging. It was not import from XAR it was import another wiki  \ncjdelisle` - (21:46): import means copy then.  \ncjdelisle` - (21:46): ?  \njvelo - (21:46): yes  \nvmassol - (21:46): jvelo: we can add them manually for the missing bundledwith  \njvelo - (21:46): my bad, I abuse from the language  \njvelo - (21:46): vmassol, yes  \njvelo - (21:46): that's fine, that's what I have been doing  \ncjdelisle` - (21:46): Ok. I just did an interwiki copy and could not repeat. I checked that the attachment was indeed stored in the db and it was.  \nmbryant left at 21:46 (Quit: KVIrc 4.0.2 Insomnia http://www.kvirc.net/  \ncjdelisle` - (21:48): My little theory on why they are all 8192bytes is that the server file IO hanged and the attachments could only save to memory. When a fileitem becomes larger than 10k it is persisted to the disk. Because the buffers used for copying were 4096b, the attachments all stopped at 8192.  \nvmassol - (21:48): cjdelisle`: there's probably a bug when a failure happens on the path somewhere  \nvmassol - (21:49): (yep something like that)  \nvmassol - (21:49): since you introduced disk io, that's a new point of failure so we need to handle potential sync issues  \ncjdelisle` - (21:50): It is indeed a bug in terms of not being ACID but it is not a huge regression blocking copying of documents.  \ncjdelisle` - (21:50): Perhaps it should be checking that the data is actually saved.  \nvmassol - (21:52): jvelo: you've removed the summary :)  \njvelo - (21:53): ah  \njvelo - (21:53): adding it back  \nvmassol - (21:53): jvelo: so what do we do in the end for the license?  \njvelo - (21:54): we don't add it for bundled items.
