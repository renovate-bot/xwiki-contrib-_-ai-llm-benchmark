Otherwise we can do it the old way there but it requires to write 2 migations I guess  \n08:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Well, the script is rather complex, it has a lot of SQL in it  \n08:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So there are three solutions  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(trying to figure out what I won't like ;))  \n08:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Indeed, port Liquibase to 3.5 and write a script in it  \n08:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a02 is to write a migrator full of SQL that is only triggered on Postgres  \n08:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So the fact that it isn't very portable doesn't matter  \n08:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's targeted for one RDMBS only  \n08:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and maybe oracle too)  \n08:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, Oracle too  \n08:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But I guess it would look different, so another migrator for it  \n08:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which reminds me I need to send today a proposal on supported DBs)  \n08:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a03 is to just write an external script and tell users to run it if they want to upgrade from pre-3.3 to something new  \n08:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how is 3 simpler to write for us?  \n08:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's easier to maintain  \n08:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01 and 2 look better since it's \"automatic\" and xwiki-based  \n08:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mean our migrators are done for that  \n08:10\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If it's written in the platform itself, we can't ship a newer version of the script to older versions of XWiki  \n08:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n08:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can force a migrator  \n08:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can document it  \n08:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and ask users who've already migrated to force to run it  \n08:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If it's external, it's going to be hard to let users install versions that don't provide this migrator, like 3.4  \n08:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0OR  \n08:11\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Wrong  \n08:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even better  \n08:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If it's internal, it's going to be hard to let users install versions that don't provide this migrator, like 3.4  \n08:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this migrator can run against the latest DB version  \n08:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and check if it needs to run  \n08:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the users just need to upgrade to the latest 3.5.x or 4.x  \n08:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's not a question of whether the migrator should or should not run  \n08:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's the fact that we're forcing users to use the most recent version if they want the right migrator  \n08:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that sounds ok to me  \n08:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ we get them to migrate which is great :)  \n08:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since migrators are bound to the platform version  \n08:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we don't want them on oldish versions)  \n08:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as much as possible)  \n08:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yeah, only that it doesn't work like this with colossal clients  \n08:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok we can ask about that  \n08:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0An upgrade takes months  \n08:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but if their wiki doesn't work  \n08:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they won't care  \n08:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they'll be ok with it I'm pretty sure  \n08:14\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If they want to migrate to 4.0, they should have started this decision last summer  \n08:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok what I can do is check with Ludovic since I'm going to the XWiki SAS office otday  \n08:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Anyway, both the script and the migrator are going to use the same code  \n08:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n08:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So we can do both  \n08:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was going to say that  \n08:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Write the code in a migrator, and put the script somewhere on xwiki.rog  \n08:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sounds good  \n08:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0There's another problem with Postgres, the one with accented chars and history  \n08:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Indeed, it seems that the materialized\\_clob only works with ASCII chars, so we should switch to materialized\\_blob instead  \n08:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for all DBs?  \n08:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I don't know...  \n08:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'm wondering if there's any benefit in clobs that blobs don't have  \n08:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't need, we need to read up on this  \n08:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/need/know/  \n08:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We don't do anything with that text at the database level  \n08:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It makes sense to use clobs when you want to use some text functions on that data  \n08:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0If we just want to store and retrieve text, then a blob would do just fine  \n08:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah I guess for full text search in the DB for ex a Blob wouldn't do  \n08:19\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Exactly  \n08:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we're not using that right now though since we're using lucene)  \n08:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So, the question is, do we want full text search on stuff like the versioning diffs, attachment content, class xml?  \n08:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n08:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Even if we would allow that, it's still going to be horribly slow  \n08:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we (you) should read up a bit more on pros/cons of BLOB vs CLOB with various DBs when using hibernate  \n08:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and send a proposal to the list  \n08:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK  \n08:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Going to sleep now  \n08:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n08:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to catch a train  \n08:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm in luxembourg)  \n08:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good night  \n08:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:26\u00a0<+florinciu>\u00a0sdumitriu: Hi. While it's hard to make an upgrade under 2-3 weeks(including client validation), no upgrade should take months.  \n08:26\u00a0<+florinciu>\u00a0if it takes this longs maybe it's because it brings new custom features, otherwise something went wrong and the upgrade wan't handled properly.  \n08:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's not the technical process itself that takes long, it's the bureaucracy  \n08:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Hi florinciu, hope you're doing well  \n08:31\u00a0<+florinciu>\u00a0yes, all is fine :)  \n08:31\u00a0<+florinciu>\u00a0I agree it's the bureaucracy. I've been there. :)  \n08:32\u00a0<+florinciu>\u00a0I'm just saying that even large upgrades shoud be pushed to average at a few weeks or 1-2 months max, not 6 months or so. :)  \n08:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n08:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n08:49\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n09:15\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0The UI efforts of the MediaWiki community looks very interesting: \u00a0http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:VisualEditorSandbox  \n09:29\u00a0<deepanshum>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:40\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:55\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:56\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n10:02\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:14\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Hello.

Hope the devs get it.  \n22:39\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0re bootstrap, I'm not sure exactly what your vision is but it's worth noting that according to a quick check, we have somewhere around 100,000 lines of CSS so changing everything over to be based on bootstrap is probably not feasible.  \n22:40\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0As far as making a minimalistic skin based on bootstrap, perhaps for mobile clients, that might make more sense.  \n22:42\u00a0<Faryshta>\u00a0cjd, well I can make one for mobiles, another for PC's. Its not a problem.  \n22:45\u00a0<Faryshta>\u00a0cjd, can you think on any other thing need for xwiki that can be done during the summer of code?  \n22:47\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0You can look at the things which have been proposed, I've not proposed anything myself because I can't think of anything which is small enough that it can happen in 1 summer.  \n22:53\u00a0<Faryshta>\u00a0cjd yes and one of them is implementation with a major opensource project.  \n23:13\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:58\u00a0<deepanshum>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
