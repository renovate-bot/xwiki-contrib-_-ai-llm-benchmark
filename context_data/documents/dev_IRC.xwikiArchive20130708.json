 \n03:55\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0I'm trying to figure out why xwiki sometimes throws up an entire info box around something that seems like it has a start/stop. \u00a0Maybe it's because some things are being escaped in the body of my text?  \n03:56\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0This is the wiki content: http://pastebin.com/j7eemn7H  \n03:56\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0And line #54 is what I'm struggling with: {{info}}Hi, this is info box{{//info}}  \n03:58\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0ok...it's the //  \n03:58\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0sorry  \n07:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:25\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:46\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0good morning  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good morning  \n09:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: when I install the UI with the xar on the latest 5.1-snap XEM I get http://hastebin.com/hexefeyufo.sm in the console and this key \"workspacemanager.template.install.notYetComplete\" on the homepage instead of the link to install the workspace template  \n09:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: you get untranslated content because of errors like \"Access denied when checking \u00a0access to [Wiki xwiki] for user [xwiki:XWiki.Admin]\" (which mean the corresponding translations are not regsitered) but I don't understand why this user does not have admin right  \n09:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. the root of your issues is that for some reason Admin user does not have admin right...  \n09:04\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0that's weird. even with superadmin I still see that key  \n09:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I restarted the wiki and now I don't see the key anymore  \n09:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I get the proper text and link  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: what do you mean by \"even with superadmin\" ?  \n09:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I mean I logged out of the Admin user and logged in with superadmin  \n09:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I still got the key then  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this has nothing to do with the current user  \n09:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the right check is done when the document is saved to see if the document author has to right to do what he wants to do (regsiter en translation document for the whole wiki)  \n09:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/to/the/  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you restart the check is done again  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and for some reason this time it works (as it should)  \n09:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I don't understand is why suddenly it does not work anymore during install  \n09:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the first time I see this  \n09:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0me too  \n09:11\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n09:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what did you do exactly ?  \n09:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I set up xwiki with jetty. enabled superadmin in xwiki.cfg .cancel on the dw. logged in as superadmin and installed the UI. logged-out with superadmin and logged-in as Admin. go to the homepage  \n09:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0I used hsqldb  \n09:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: wait you did not used DW ?  \n09:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that's probably why  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is nothing forcing admin user to be installed first in the all in one xar so all stuff based on document author right have this kind of issue  \n09:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0it didn't happen before though  \n09:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it did  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's for sure  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and with various other feature like translations  \n09:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0ok then since I got hired I don't remember seeing the translation :)  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we still have a general order issue when the author of the document is imported with the documents  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: you should not have the isue if you don't import as backup pack  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in that case document will be imported as superadmin so no right issue  \n09:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway in general importing as backup pack should be only well for backups  \n09:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you should never use that for installing an application  \n09:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a pity it's on by default  \n09:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but since DW import is supposed to be more and more for backup and not installing extensions  \n09:20\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I'll try again without selecting backup  \n09:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys we need to release today, what are we missing to start the release?  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(marius is finishing an improvement and then we're good I think)  \n09:24\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0tmortagne: I can confirm the bug doesn't happen if I deselect the backup checkbox  \n09:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria: ok so that's it, I think there is a jira issue about that  \n09:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's not an easy fix, will require quite some refactoring of how we handle event produced by import. But now that you have to already be admin to import a XAR it's less an issue that it used to be (when you were importing as guest)  \n09:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:46\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n10:08\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:42\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:04\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0Is it possible to turn off formatting inside macros , like box or info ?  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0altker128: sure, just escape the content  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{{\u2026}}}  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:18\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0That's smart :)  \n11:18\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0Is there a way to indent the box as well?  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indent?  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that looks like CSS no?  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(% style=\"\u2026\" %){{box \u2026  \n{{/irclog}}  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(either that or using a stylesheet extension)  \n11:20\u00a0<altker128>\u00a0I mean, if I have bullets, I want the box to be at the same \"tab stop\" as a bullet  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0use groups (((\u2026.)))  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* item 1(((  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{box...}}  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0)))  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* item 2  \n12:05\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n12:07\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:07\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:09\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n12:12\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:26\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n12:26\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:32\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n12:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I have to go for lunch, be back in 1h~1h30  \n12:51\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:51\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n13:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0hello devs. I am playing with the search on a XEM.
