 \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi cjd  \n09:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Also I notice that CKEditor extension is maturing nicely :)  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed that's a bug cjd  \n09:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Do you need a report or is this all set  \n09:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0?  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have no idea, better report it just in case  \n09:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea1: ?  \n09:31\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0cjd: go ahead and report it  \n09:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ok  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm just testing ckeditor a bit too and there are very nice things  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I like the ability to move a macro around  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with drag and drop  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea if it's useful but it's fancy ;)  \n09:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Yes, that's one which is breaking our Realtime WYSIWYG :)  \n09:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0we have an issue opened for that  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n09:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It causes the macro to turn into text  \n09:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CKEDITOR-54  \n09:33\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0thanks  \n09:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Did you make any progress on the strike/underline issue ?  \n09:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Oh interesting, I created a document with an empty title and an H1 header at the top and then I looked at the title and the title is the name of the document  \n09:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so at some point I guess we yanked that \"fish around in the content looking for a header and use that for the title\" thing from getTitle() ?  \n09:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I suppose that was a killer for performance so maybe tmortagne removed it..  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a compat flag to turn it back on  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that was several years ago  \n09:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0heh  \n09:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0+1 remove it, it's magical and bad for perf  \n09:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and I remember the code for handling it, esp. w/ syntax 1 was awful  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0# xwiki.title.compatibility=1  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9971  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed labelled as performance  \n09:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Yeah, I have a vague memory of some profiling results coming back and getTitle() was quite a killer  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so several years ago is a bit exagerated ;) just one year  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one year+  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is was disabled several years ago and enabled back one release later for \"retro compatibility reason\"  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and then finally disabled again  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah that's why I had the memory of several years  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: any idea how to get rig of a local modificaiton that doesn't want to go away because of case  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0git reset --hard origin/master  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't work  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's \u00a0../xwiki-rendering-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/rendering/block/ListBLock.java  \n09:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: well I don't understand why you have case issue anywhere else than Windows to begin with :)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"t is because the osx file system is case preserving andcase insensitive by default.\"  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll try a git mv and then discard  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doesn't work  \n09:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh yeah, I flipped my mac to case sensitive just so I wouldn't have Weird Issues  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll remove my whole ws  \n09:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sorry don't have much experience with this kind of issue :)  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I asked yu becauase I remember you knew a trick once  \n09:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a trick I never used then or it was someone else  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway done  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0argh  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0problem is still there  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll need to google more  \n09:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is the issue exactly ?  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/93c54def7b0c62980afe0de5d5c5e25c/raw/fa60fafdb22dc10bc1f8c316f6107d9b00ad81a0/gistfile1.txt  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm makes me think that the ListBLock vs ListBlock thing probably makes impossible to git pull on windows and I'm surpised you could if you have case insensitive FS  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you have two files or only one ?  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's probably impossible to fix your issue if you have only one file  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we'll probably have to either revert of find another name for the new class  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have only ListBLock.java  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I could wipe out my HD and reformat it differently but I'd rather not do that ;)  \n10:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0reopened XRENDERING-438  \n10:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and nobody can do that on Windows anyway so we need to fix it  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying somrthing  \n10:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you should probably still do it at some point ;)  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no dice  \n10:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure what name to choose instead of ListBlock...  \n10:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It doesn't work to `git clone` fresh and then just never checkout old versions ?  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0git clone doesn't work  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see my paste above  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: at best you have a missing file so no it doe snot work  \n10:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ouch  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now I cannot merge the fix I did on master this morning to the 7.4.x branch  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0...  \n10:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Oops, oops, oops, was not expecting this mess doing this ListBlock thing...  \n10:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Sorry for it  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0woshilapin: me neither  \n11:09\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0You know what would be really cool is if I type \\*something\\* in CKEditor, it converted that into italic automatically like autocorrect and \\*\\*bold\\*\\* same  \n11:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Another cool feature would be if when closing the tab w/o saving, instead of a popup it just stored the HTML into localStorage and then when you open the same wiki/space/document/language, you see a little message just below the editor saying \"You have unsaved work from <date/time>, restore it?\"  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: yes that would be nice to have this mode  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0confluence has it  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw we call it live helpers  \n11:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Ahh ok  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's one of our oldest issues  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0raised by ludo 10 years ago...oops  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-206  \n11:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It might be possible to build this as a filter in the Realtime infrastructure  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we surely need this outside of realtime  \n11:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0But if realtime is not installed everywhere by default then we have failed our mission so I don't like the sound of that much :)  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I understand  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's not related to realtime  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't need to make realtile a turing machine ;)  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*realtime  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0turing complete  \n11:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah  \n11:43\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm trying to think whether external auto-replace of stuff will challenge our algorithm but I suppose it won't very much because CKEditor is already doing it w/ bold/italic/etc  \n13:03\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n13:30\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:49\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n14:02\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys what do you prefer when the XHTML parser fails to parse page content: 1) report an error about invalid content or 2) return an empty XDOM and just log a warning in the logs. I think I prefer 1)  \n14:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hmm what makes it fail ?  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0invalid xml for example  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're talking about XHTML parser, not the HTML one which performs cleaning of input  \n14:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0var b = document.createElement('body'); b.innerHTML = badHTML; goodHTML = b.innerHTML \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0:D  \n14:49\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'd go for 1  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would also be a solution btw, to also clean xhtml input as we do for the html parser but anwyay the question still stand in general  \n14:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if we're posting the save and you give us back some kind of an ajax error, we'll cram the stuff through a cleaner and post again  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now we generate an NPE when a parser fails to parse some content :)  \n14:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, would be nice if we get an error back in the ajax when saving  \n14:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0browsers can parse \\*anything\\*  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that's another approach  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to prevent having invalid content in the first place  \n14:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0so innerHTML is aweful but it will convert kind of anything imaginable into valid HTML  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it means degragded perf  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*degraded  \n14:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since you need to parse the content to know if it's good or not  \n14:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0well if we're posting, we're going to post up innerHTML so if anything goes wrong, it would be best to throw an error which is clear enough that the user can see it and report a bug  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0imagine using the REST api to set some content in a page for ex  \n14:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0because This Should Never Happen  \n14:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, IMO be loud  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh it happens easily enough  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just type \"hello\" in xhtml content  \n14:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0:)  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is invalid xhtml  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless we run the html cleaner on it  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even for xhtml  \n14:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Aaron has a hidden function for pushing garbage over the realtime socket to torture the other browser  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so slow down xhtml input  \n14:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that reminds me of this  \n14:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nah, skip HTML cleaner, throw an error  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0becaue we can't gaurantee that no parser will ever generate an error anyway  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to handle this anyway  \n14:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0give it back in REST/AJAX and let \"us\" handle it  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rest?  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there' sno rest/ajax  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is rendering  \n14:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh ok, you mentioned \"14:52 <@vmassol> imagine using the REST api\"...  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's when you said that we should check the input before saving  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was mentioning this as an example that we shouldn't do that  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this = REST  \n14:55\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0who's this Aaron guy  \n14:55\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0he's taking credit for my work  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some astroturfer  \n14:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'd say if you're converting, convert and if something fails be loud, if you're just storing html then maybe you're not testing validity..  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok with http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-440 ?  \n15:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yes, makes no sense to have any parser fail for empty content  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the trick is in the implementation \u2026.  \n15:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I'll use a PushbackInputStream  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0PushBackReader actually  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I'll do something simpler  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can check the String before parsing it no ?  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm doing this  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a bit less good but it's easier  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0less good = it doesn't support all use cases but probably good neough  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*enough  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well the user case described in the issue is empty content :)  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I mean is that we'd still be able to lookup the parser and call it  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it'll still fail  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but at least document rendering will work  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I meant test the String in the parser  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the parser receive a String  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only ContentParser  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after that it's a Reader  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DefaultContentParser does: getParser(syntax).parse(new StringReader(content));  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm checking there  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so it would fix the issue then  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed that won't fix XRENDERING-440  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I forgot anout Reader  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for XRENDERING-440 I need a PushBackReader  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm still hesitating ;)  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I fix XRENDERING-440 then I only fix one parser  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it's possible to configure the XML parser used so that it does not fail with empty content, or fail with specific exception  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I checked  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and couldn't find an option  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it fails with a SAXException  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually a SAXParseException  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's too generic  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i'm not a big fan of the \"I don't know all the syntaxes but I'm sure nobody will ever do something with empty string\" kind of fix, IMO it should be parser responsability  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you think that empty content shouldn't always generate an empty XDOM?  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think only the parser knows  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: there's another possibility which is also good I think  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is to run the html cleaner also for xhtml input  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this will make empty content be supported)  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would make the xhtml parser less fragilr  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*fragile  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure about that, it makes the whole thing way slower for already valid content  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in prctice we don't use the xhtml parser  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you are not sure of your content you should use the html parser  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless cleaner is turned off  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that was our logic  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I see a lot of users complaining about the xhtml parser  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0every time the issue is that the input is not valid xhtml  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then they should use something else...  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for sure....  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's not xhtml content then it does not work with xhtml parser, it's not like we were not provided another parser to take care of that  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:59\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:08\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Hello!

It's a pain ATM for me and I can't merge changes  \n16:26\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: did not really decided yet, I guess the best is to simply revert and keep the issue open, we can reapply it and modify if a good name is found  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sounds good to me  \n16:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: can I let you do it ? I have lots of modif on platform right now  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok but not now then I need to finish what I'm on first since I have lots of modifs in rendering ;)  \n16:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha right it's rendering, doing it  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks...  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I need to clone again...  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and recreate my IDE project  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do I commit my change  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I'll need to copy my modified files in the new workspace...  \n16:55\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why clone again ?  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what can I do?  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I cannot pull  \n17:05\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because I have local changes  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which I cannot get rid of  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because of the issue  \n17:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you should be able to fetch and them move to last commit cancelling the locl modifications  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's too late now butI can fetch with local modifications?  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also note that I had a local commit as I mentioned  \n17:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway it's sorted out now  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fetch don't touch you workspace so it does not care about local modification  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it just update the commits  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed, maybe it would have worked to then do a git checkout on the gile  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*file  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then the merge  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* git reset --hard  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/test/tested/  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would have lost my changes  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hence the checkout  \n17:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(I tough git reset was staying on the same commit but it seems to move to the last one)  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n17:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should have stashed them  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I could have uncommitted and stahed  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FYI I'm introducing a ErrorBlockGenerator component in rendering  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to replace MacroErrorManager  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that I can use it in getXDOM()  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably in org.xwiki.rendering.util  \n17:24\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ansuz: hi  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think there's sometihng amiss in your commits  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they don't find their way in the jira commit tab for the related issues  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you sure you reference the jira issue in the commit message?
