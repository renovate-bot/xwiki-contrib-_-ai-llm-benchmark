Or we already have something for this?  \ntachirei - (03/07/2009 12:57): 2) do you think that the fact we can not specify a single skin extension object will lead to problems?  \ntachirei - (03/07/2009 12:58): for XOffice Style Support, ofc :)  \nflorinciu - (03/07/2009 13:00): 1) no. the client should map only the api. You should build the specific \u00a0functionality in your module  \nflorinciu - (03/07/2009 13:00): in your case you just need to add an object, i think  \nflorinciu - (03/07/2009 13:01): adding objects is already in IXWikiClient  \nflorinciu - (03/07/2009 13:01): 2) not sure  \nflorinciu - (03/07/2009 13:02): why would you have more then one skin extension object in a document?  \ntachirei - (03/07/2009 13:06): an user adds it from web interface, not XOffice  \ntrifon joined #xwiki at 13:09  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 13:10  \nflorinciu - (03/07/2009 13:12): meaning that he adds the second one?  \ntachirei - (03/07/2009 13:13): second, third, etc... I don't think this will happen often. An user will probably edit current skin extension used in the page, but just in case..  \nflorinciu - (03/07/2009 13:14): I don't think there would be major problems. I need to digg into this. But we're not there yet.  \ntachirei - (03/07/2009 13:15): the question is: from XWord I should delete the skin extension objects, combine them into a single one and add it to the page? or I should only manage XWord skin extension?  \ntachirei - (03/07/2009 13:15): yes, we're not there yet. but it's something we need to think about  \ncristinaS joined #xwiki at 13:16  \ntachirei left #xwiki at 13:24  \ntrifon\\_ left at 13:25 (Connection timed out)  \ncristinaS left at 13:33 (\"I don't like you.
