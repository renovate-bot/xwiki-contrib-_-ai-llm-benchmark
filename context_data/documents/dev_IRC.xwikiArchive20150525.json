However - I changed them later.  \n14:17\u00a0<fwiesing>\u00a0I tried to start the service - but the same error as yesterday posted.  \n14:18\u00a0<fwiesing>\u00a0Then - I analyzed the connection and tried different settings - you can see this in the hibernate-files I loaded up.  \n14:19\u00a0<fwiesing>\u00a0Then I tested with the commandline - and I was successful to connect with the user xwiki to the database xwiki (you can see this in the attached test-protocoll).  \n14:19\u00a0<fwiesing>\u00a0further - I was able to create a database - but with exactly the same users in the hibernate.cfg.xml it didn't work.  \n14:20\u00a0<fwiesing>\u00a0... this what I found out.  \n14:21\u00a0<fwiesing>\u00a0I was unable to get it working with the postgresql-server. (the jdbc41-driver is installed in the WEB-INF/lib - and set to mode 777)  \n14:22\u00a0<fwiesing>\u00a0that's all - and thx for help yesterday. The hint with the .zip was helpful, because I was able to see the differences.  \n15:01\u00a0<fwiesing>\u00a0AFK  \n15:08\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:52\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has quit  \n15:53\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:14\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has quit  \n16:16\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:24\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n17:28\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:35\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:45\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:57\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:07\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has quit  \n22:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n22:32\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n23:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
