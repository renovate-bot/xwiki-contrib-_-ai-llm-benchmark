Something like (/), (x), etc  \n16:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0or we don't have all icons mapped ?  \n16:19\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0because I don't know how to reference a silk icon from the xwiki 2.1 syntax  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: sorry was otp  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax#HImages  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it explains how to display an icon  \n16:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, found  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now if you want to add new mappings  \n16:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I wasn't searching for icon :)  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can check xwiki.properties  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I don't think it's documented yet)  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can redefine or add new mappings  \n16:27\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, and if I don't have privileges ? I want to add (flag\\_green) but does not because I guess there is no mapping, so I should use URL instead  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you're not admin you're not allowed to do this  \n16:29\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0i'm not  \n16:29\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0an admin  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then contact your admin  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:29\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0too bad, now I have to use some URL to add these icons, instead of using the internal mechanism  \n16:30\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0because (/) or (x) are mapped by default  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your admin doesn't allow to add a new mapping?  \n16:30\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0It should allow, but I think he is busy :)  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually there's supposed to be a way to configure this from the wiki  \n16:31\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but why didn't re autmatically map the values http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/previews/index\\_abc.pn from  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I doubt it's working  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0map to what?  \n16:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0map to something that they can be used from syntax  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they can be used from syntax already  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I said aboe  \n16:32\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0like (/) means accept (the first icon)  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I gave you the link  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0image:icon:<name>  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now if what you want is shortcuts for all good luck for finding shortcuts\u2026 :)  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and in addition it's going to slow down a bit the wiki)  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/going/may/  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(flag\\_red) is a possibility but not very nice IMO  \n16:34\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0no, I don't need shortcuts.
