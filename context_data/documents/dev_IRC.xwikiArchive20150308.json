New user to xWiki here. Running 6.4.2. Moving from mediawiki and one feature that we would REALLY love to have which is the \"readers\" feature. It shows which registered users have viewed a page. Is there anything like this for xwiki?  \n22:22\u00a0<mahomed>\u00a0I have searched extensions and googled but I can't find anything relevant. I fear it's not possible but just wondering if anyone can helo  \n22:22\u00a0<mahomed>\u00a0\\*help\n"}
