Maybe rewriting it would be easier.  \nvmassol - (16:40): cjdelisle: it's already componentized for the rendering  \nvmassol - (16:40): in xwiki-rendering  \nmflorea - (16:41): vmassol: btw, the way you exposed the XHTML link marker parser/rendered is very nice :) really easy for me to use  \nvmassol - (16:41): mflorea: cool :)  \nvmassol - (16:41): cjdelisle: we have a 1.0 parser/renderer there  \nvmassol - (16:41): so once we remove all deps on the rendering located in xwiki-core  \ncjdelisle - (16:41): I thought that didn't really work or something like.  \nvmassol - (16:41): we can simply remove the code  \nvmassol - (16:42): cjdelisle: yeah it's not 100% guaranteed to be similar but close\u2026. that said we can also move the rendering part of xwiki-core in a separate build module and have an if in the code to decide what to use  \nvmassol - (16:43): we need to decide what level of compat we want  \ncjdelisle - (16:43): hehe slowly wean people off by breaking a few things every release ;)  \nvmassol - (16:43): :)  \nvmassol - (16:44): right now the only thing tying us to the rendering in xwiki-core is the template I think  \nvmassol - (16:44): so once we fix the templates to use xwiki-rendering we should be able to move out or remove the rendering in xiki-core  \nvmassol - (16:44): s/template/templates/  \ncjdelisle - (16:45): templates is another ball of mud similar to the xwiki-core.  \ncjdelisle - (16:46): Once you add a template you can never guarentee that someone isn;t using it, template modulaity isn't very good.  \ncjdelisle - (16:47): Also I think the main cause of page load time is the calls made from the templates.  \ncjdelisle - (16:52): hmm.

(19:17): what this [DEBUG] thing is supposed to be ?  \nvmassol - (19:17): the output from mvn install -X  \ntmortagne - (19:18): or but looks like that's not what Reflexion find in the classloader when using ClasspathHelper.getUrlsForCurrentClasspath(), i'm currently trying with ClasspathHelper.getUrlsForPackagePrefix(testPackage) as i said  \ntmortagne - (19:18): i'm just not sure what it will do when testPackage is an empty string  \ntmortagne - (19:18): but it's working well otherwise  \nvmassol - (19:18): ClasspathHelper.getUrlsForPackagePrefix(testPackage) \u00a0does't work for me even in my IDE  \ntmortagne - (19:19): that's waht extension manager is using and it's working well on hudson, and on maven/Eclipse for me  \nvmassol - (19:19): I can try useSystemClassLoader but I'm not sure what side effect it can have  \nvmassol - (19:19): trying....  \ntmortagne - (19:19): but again i really thing that's not the right way  \ntmortagne - (19:20): IMO you should get the only one URL you need instead of scanning everything  \nvmassol - (19:20): sure let's try to find something better  \ntmortagne - (19:20): which could be costly for tests  \nvmassol - (19:22): unfortunately I have to go to the swimming pool now\u2026. be back later\u2026. if you find something let me know, thans  \nvmassol - (19:22): thanks  \nr4tune joined #xwiki at 19:35  \nr4tune - (19:35): hmm  \nr4tune - (19:35): i downloaded your zip and go xwiki  \nr4tune - (19:36): and i published articles and marked them as private  \nr4tune - (19:36): yet i can browse them without logging in...  \nr4tune - (19:36): it's my own personal wiki behind a firewall so not important in this instance, but...  \nr4tune - (19:36): it makes me question if it's wise to deploy the software as my wiki in a DMOZ  \ntmortagne - (19:37): r4tune: what do you mean exactly by \"marked them as private\" ?  \nr4tune - (19:37): a tickbox which says to make it \"hiddden\" or some such  \nr4tune - (19:37): ill do a test post to give more info  \nr4tune - (19:38): as well as a general knowledge base  \nr4tune - (19:38): so you know, the private flag was important  \ntmortagne - (19:38): where is this tickbox ?  \ntmortagne - (19:38): when you create a blog post you mean ?  \nr4tune - (19:38): yeah  \nr4tune - (19:39): it renders the supposedly private entries  \nr4tune - (19:39): although not properly titled  \nr4tune - (19:39): $escapetool.xml(${pdoc.getRenderedTitle('plain/1.0')}) \u00bb  \nr4tune - (19:39): stuff like this appears  \ntmortagne - (19:39): not sure what this is used for in the blog, sdumitriu any idea ?  \nsdumitriu - (19:39): Checking  \nsdumitriu - (19:40): Hi r4tune  \nr4tune - (19:40): hi :)  \nsdumitriu - (19:40): When you say \"browse\", do you mean view the blog entry, or see it listed on the blog homepage?  \nr4tune - (19:41): brb door  \nr4tune - (19:41): both  \ncjdelisle - (19:41): heh great name.  \nsdumitriu - (19:44): OK, it's normal to be able to see the blog post once you land on that page  \nEnygma` left at 19:45 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nsdumitriu - (19:45): But it shouldn't be listed on the blog homepage  \nsdumitriu - (19:45): To actually make a blog post private, you must edit the rights for it  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 19:45  \nlpereira left at 19:47 (Quit: Leaving.  \nr4tune - (19:49): http://img214.imageshack.us/my.php?image=plasmadesktopvw2504.png  \nr4tune - (19:49): they have this button  \nr4tune - (19:50): it gives the impression if you click them, the post becomes hidden.  \nr4tune - (19:52): yet i can view the website with no cookies  \nr4tune - (19:53): and they show up in the blog categories with java code instead of titles for some parts  \nr4tune - (19:53): but the full body text is visible...  \nr4tune - (19:53): if the padlock doesn't make the post hidden like it says it will  \nr4tune - (19:53): then perhaps the tool-tip should say what it does?  \nr4tune - (19:53): otherwise people like me will get confused  \nr4tune - (19:57): i'd love to show you guys the whole thing so you had more to go on  \nr4tune - (19:57): but due to nature of the data i can't  \nr4tune - (19:58): btw i fixed vim's read and write file webdav support just because i like xwiki so much, i'm not sure they will include my fix in the main distribution... the maintainer is considering it because i made it rely on the expect program but what it was doing before doesn't work  \nr4tune - (19:58): i do like xwiki  \nr4tune - (19:59): hope you can figure it out without my legal spat data :)  \nsdumitriu - (19:59): Just tried it, and if I \"hide\" the blog post, it doesn't appear at all in the blog homepage, in the categories, in the RSS  \nsdumitriu - (20:00): It can be seen, which is \"normal\" according to the implementation  \nsdumitriu - (20:00): It is listed on the Dashboard (Recent changes), which is also \"normal\"  \nr4tune - (20:00): so why does the padlock say \"hide it from other users?\"  \nr4tune - (20:00): without logging in i can read the full content of the post  \nsdumitriu - (20:01): \"Hidden\" here has a different meaning than \"completely private\"  \nr4tune - (20:01): i suggest it needs clarification  \nsdumitriu - (20:01): Indeed  \nr4tune - (20:01): but it's your program :)  \nsdumitriu - (20:01): I agree with that  \nsdumitriu - (20:01): The idea is that XWiki is a collaborative platform  \nsdumitriu - (20:01): So people should be able to collaborate on not-yet-published blog posts  \nsdumitriu - (20:02): If the author gives them the URL to access it  \ntmortagne - (20:02): maybe rename it to \"unpublish\" or something then ;)  \nsdumitriu - (20:02): Do you have a suggestion for a clearer text?  \nr4tune - (20:02): yeah, i would like for my IT related stuff to be someday exported to a DMOZ wiki for that purpose, but it also seemed a good way to keep a chronological log of all the correspondence betwen me, bank, and two regulatory authorities  \nsdumitriu - (20:02): The meaning is \"unlisted\"  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 20:03  \nr4tune - (20:03): hmm  \nr4tune - (20:04): only to add in capital letters \"THIS DOESN'T MAKE THE POST UNVIEWABLE\" which would add more confusion  \nr4tune - (20:04): maybe the padlock should ... hide the post completely and make the necessary ACL mods, why would i want to semi-hide it?  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 20:04  \nr4tune - (20:05): i can just not publish it to do that  \nabusenius - (20:05): r4tune: if you want to completely hide something, why are you posting it online in the first place? :)  \nr4tune - (20:05): abusenius: i haven't like i said it's behind a firewall  \nr4tune - (20:06): but a lot of the data in there is useful knowledge i intend to share  \nr4tune - (20:06): when i saw the \"hide from other users\" button i thought it could also be used to track this sort of private data at the same time  \nabusenius - (20:06): yea, I agree its confusing  \nabusenius - (20:07): maybe it should say something like \"this is a draft\", this would be closer to reality  \nr4tune - (20:09): btw , and off topic, the bank will lose, the regularly bodies have both indicated to me they believe I am correct but they do not make the final decision :)  \nr4tune - (20:09): the other 13 financial organisations i had the same argument with eventually complied without making me take it so far heh  \nabusenius left at 20:10 (Remote host closed the connection  \ncjdelisle - (20:11): \"the bank will lose\" r4tune = Andrew Jackson  \nr4tune - (20:12): 13 other organisations including banks decided i was right to to do what i was telling them to  \nr4tune - (20:12): this bank stands alone.. :D  \nr4tune - (20:12): some of them even sent me letters starting \"thank you for your correspondence, we are pleased to tell you...\"  \nr4tune - (20:12): pleased my asss  \nr4tune - (20:12): lol  \ncjdelisle - (20:13): happy hunting ;)  \nr4tune - (20:15): this is the UK, you occasionally hear a story of bailiffs going into a bank's branch and siezing their machines because they think they are above the law and can break it without any comeback from the common citizen, i'll be sending this bank an \"i'm pleased to tell you that you have complied...\" when they lose  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 20:20  \nr4tune - (20:20): if you ever do any banking in the UK, Santander (Spanish bank, of course, not an English one) were the most responsive, i can't really recommend the banks they took over they were terrible banks but if they bring the same efficiency and attitude to the high street I'm glad they bought out two of our banks, go Span.  \nr4tune - (20:21): brought\\*  \nr4tune - (20:21): no bought  \nr4tune - (20:21): i hate that word  \nr4tune - (20:22): anyways, hope you do something about the padlock  \nr4tune - (20:22): cya chaps  \nr4tune left #xwiki at 20:22  \nsburjan` -
