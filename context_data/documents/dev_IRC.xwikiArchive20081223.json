(23/12/2008 14:39): maggo\\_: it's in user or groups permissions (like read, write, etc.)  \nmaggo\\_ - (23/12/2008 14:41): asyd: There is nothing like \"Programming right\" i can choose few things from the dropdown menu in Administration Panel but which one ist the right one?  \nasyd -

(23/12/2008 15:16): you can't give programming rights to some users/groups only on a single wiki  \nmaggo\\_ - (23/12/2008 15:17): jvdrean: hm bad, but in the main wiki i can't see anything on the group pages with programming rights  \njvdrean - (23/12/2008 15:19): this right appears only in the \"Rights\" section of the wiki Administration  \njvdrean - (23/12/2008 15:20): it's called \"program\"  \njvdrean - (23/12/2008 15:20): yourdomain.com/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=Rights  \nmaggo\\_ -
