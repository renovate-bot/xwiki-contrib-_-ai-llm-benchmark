 \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: hi  \n11:13\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0hi Vincent :)  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i don't remember the version but yes you can configure the app panel  \n11:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the admin  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Pbas is not talking about the panel I think  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Panels%20Application#HApplicationPanel  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah sorry  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0read too fast again :)  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the app index is meant to list all  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so no you can't  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless you modify its script of coruse  \n11:15\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok then these screens are differents then: https://snag.gy/NemQSX.jpg  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Pbas: if the user does not have view right on that application it will not see it, that's the only way I can think of  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: yes they are different  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n11:16\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0No I tested this way: it doesn't work  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that the \"raison d'etre\" of the app index :)  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the app panel doesn't contain eveyrthing  \n11:16\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0(maybe I must hide all application pages)  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we needed a way to list all apps present in the wiki  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other way is simple  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have 2 options  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) you filter yourself the app you wish to see by changing the sript  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) you modify the UIX of the apps you don't want to see under some conditions \u00a0to include some #if  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as we do for example for the scheduler app  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(only admins see it for ex)  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Pbas: It definitely work with view right  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03 you put permissions on their pages  \n11:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you have to do it at space level probably, not just the home page of the application  \n11:18\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ty I will try your solution 2 (bc the one I don't knwo how to do it)  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0permissions are better than hiding IMO  \n11:19\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes tmortagne (it is what I though later :) )  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if what you're after is to only make them not listed for some category of users  \n11:19\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0no it is for all normal user (non admin)  \n11:20\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok thxs  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03 is even simpler I think  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for example by default only admins have access to the scheduler and if you log out you won't see the scheduler in the list anymore  \n11:21\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes then, probably the most \"clean\" solution  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: there is no if in the uix of the scheduler, just right setup at space level  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0$services.uix.getExtensions API automatically filter uix the current user cannot see  \n11:23\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0(I start with \"Nested Pages Migration\")  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes I know but using an #if should also work  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should work at least for the app panel (need to checl the index script)  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the app panel will only display the entry if the label is not empty for ex  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see the point in such a hack, if user is not allowed to see the application in the list he should probably don't have access to it  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you may have various needs  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not just based on user permissions  \n11:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hide page and childs work well :)  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but not nice  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's also hidden for admins  \n11:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0and if I want add a custom application?  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends what you want Pbas  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: then register it in a UIX  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see n  \n11:26\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0how do you did taht?  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00e9http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ExtensionPoint/  \n11:26\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0thzt.  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ExtensionPoint/  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ExtensionPoint/AddApplicationUIX  \n11:26\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0that  \n11:27\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which BTW needs to be updated  \n11:27\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ty  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's no longer only the app panel  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but also the app index  \n11:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0thxs I will resume your nice answers in my user list mail :)  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0haha  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's another way Pbas  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've just read the code for Applications.WebHome (ie app index)  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it uses:  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#displayAppEntries('org.xwiki.platform.panels.Applications', '')  \n11:30\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes I saw that but I didn't manage to use it  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the second param is the doc containing the config of the app panel  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you should be able to have exactly the same display as the app panel if you wish  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc this means you'll need to handle potential merges when upgrading in the future :)  \n11:32\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I already have some (maybe too much) ;-))  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing locally  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for my own knowledge  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0although this is a bit hackish  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just found that this code is really not coded well  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the app index was hacked in apparently :)  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok works  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#set ($configDoc = $xwiki.getDocument($services.model.createDocumentReference('', 'PanelsCode', 'ApplicationsPanelConfiguration')))  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#displayAppEntries('org.xwiki.platform.panels.Applications' $configDoc)  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#displayAppEntries('org.xwiki.platform.panels.Applications', '')  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0P  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(without the P ;))  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway this is jsut a FYI :)  \n11:35\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0cool I think I use it then  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it may not be the best  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example if you don't want a search to return results from an app for normal users  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I still think that from what you told us that you should use permissions on the app space  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(same as what is done for the scheduler app)  \n11:38\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes right  \n11:38\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0but I must copy your code (probably need it in another place)  \n11:48\u00a0<flashdel>\u00a0has quit  \n12:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0is someone working on https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14092?
