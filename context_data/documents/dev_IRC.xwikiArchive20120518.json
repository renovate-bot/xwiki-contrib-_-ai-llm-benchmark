Re my link, the fix is not related to XR  \n12:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Thomas is probably the best to document it  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see ths: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Extension+Module+Repository but it's not the right place  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey I drew the first diagram  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0had forgottena buot it  \n12:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: you said: \"The speed and reliability of the http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome have been improved considerably.\"  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand why you link to e.x.o  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it to give an example of an XR instance?  \n12:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I said \"The speed and reliability of the extension repository have been improved considerably\"  \n12:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I can s/extension repository/XWiki extension repository  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I think I understand.

I've pinged thomas on skype about it...  \n12:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm worried that for a basic user \"Extension Repository Application\" doesn't make much sense and it's confusing. What's importat for a basic user is that he's now able to browse and install extensions more quickly. Also, from a technical point of view, the XR app wasn't modified, since the bug was in the rest module  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's still good to document XR and have a link to it  \n12:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I understand  \n12:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe  \n12:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/maybe//  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since XR is part of platform  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to decide if we want or not to include it in the release notes for XWiki  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally we should  \n12:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's indeed potentially confusing  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but maybe with the link it won't be  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the page will explain what XR app is  \n12:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but it needs to be documented  \n12:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the XR app  \n12:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes this is what I pinged thomas about  \n12:21\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the positive thing is that some more advanced users will find out that they can setup their own repo  \n12:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n12:22\u00a0<CIA-74>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r30fd59a\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/30fd59ad8eda46380d9f7a3da7473e459a7efcce \u000f/ (2 files in 2 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7829: Wording of the empty list of installed application is not nice - http://git.io/VGKOaQ  \n12:23\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool :)  \n12:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm trying to remmeber why the following doesn't work: [[image:extension:Extension.Chart [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)]]  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0extensions  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to apply the new strategy ;)  \n12:46\u00a0<CIA-74>\u00a0Vincent Massol\u000f master\u000f \\* rbd9898e\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/bd9898e389e4490f2f97480248f99e1aa2f1a4d0 \u000f/ xwiki-rendering-test/src/main/java/org/xwiki/rendering/test/cts/IgnoredRenderingTestClassRunner.java :\u000f [Misc] Improve test description - http://git.io/eMuIFw  \n12:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0added summary report for syntaxes! :)  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SyntaxReport  \n13:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: gentle reminder to reploy to the \"[Rendering] CTS Day #1\" thread :)  \n14:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ah, right :)  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you like the latest http://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SyntaxReport ?  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(with % completeness)  \n14:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0nice! :) you should round the percent to only 2 digits after , 83.3333333300% is a bit too long :)  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n14:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but it offers a very good overview of the supported syntaxes  \n14:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0well, percents can also be misleading (if you don't know the number of tests you might think 100% on mediawiki/1.0 is equivalent to 100% on xwiki syntax)  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why wouldn't they be equivalent?

 \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0those results are on the CTS  \n14:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0how mare tests do you have now in CTS?  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is why we need the CTS Day #1  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a05 or 6  \n14:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, what I'm saying is that there are more tests for the xwiki syntax  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but again this is only about CTS reports  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not about total xwiki tests  \n14:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I know  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case this report doesn't haven any meaning  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0till we have the full CTS suite  \n14:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0exactly  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why I've not advertised it yet :)  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't even linked it from anywhere on rendering.xwiki.org  \n14:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0right now from this page I can understand that mediawiki has the same level of support as xwiki syntax  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and this is why I'm pushing for CTS Day and to get help ;)  \n14:25\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because if we don't succeed in moving our tests to the CTS then all the work I've done so far on this will be for ntohing  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*nothing  \n14:25\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:26\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok numbers are rounded now  \n14:26\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0for the percentage, you could display xy% (N/M) , i.e. also display the number of tests out of the total number of tests  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but this total is ont he right  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where I list all tests  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0added test # in the list of tests  \n14:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway what's important now is to add more CTS tests  \n14:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reports seems good enough for now to be usable (we can always improve it later on)  \n14:33\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0hi guys, I have an XDOM and I am trying to replace all the rawblocks of syntax html with html macro blocks so that they get rendered properly in syntax 2.0.  \n14:34\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0since I need to tell the macro block constructor whether the macro is inine or not, I was wondering how can I find out whether a block is inline or not from the XDOM?
