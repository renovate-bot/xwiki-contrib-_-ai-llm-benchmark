 \nabusenius - (21:57): a stupid question, is it normal that a parameterized hql query with \"... and active.value = ? ...\", where active.value is a Boolean does \\*not\\* work if the type of the passed parameter is Boolean?  \nabusenius - (21:58): (on mysql)  \ncjdelisle` - (21:58): Boolean or boolean?  \ncjdelisle` - (21:58): I don't know if it matters but it's something to check.  \nabusenius - (21:59): Boolean  \nabusenius - (21:59): with Integer it works  \nabusenius - (21:59): boolean wouldnt work because params are passed in a List<?>  \nabusenius - (22:00): in principle I'm fine with Integer, but does it work the same with other DBs? :)  \nabusenius - (22:01): (the active.value is the \"active\" property from XWikiUsers)  \ncjdelisle` - (22:03): what happens if you pass Integer.valueOf(1) for true and Integer.valueOf(0) for false?  \nabusenius - (22:04): it works (I used $util.parseInt(), but it does essentially the same thing)  \nabusenius - (22:06): if I use a String or Boolean it fails while injecting the parameter in XWikiHibernateStore.java:2398  \nabusenius - (22:07): trying with hsqldb...  \nsdumitriu - (22:08): cjdelisle`: +1 for preRun  \ncjdelisle` - (22:08): cool  \ncjdelisle` - (22:09): heh wonder what happens when 2 transactions start and try to acquire some of the same locks...  \nsdumitriu - (22:09): abusenius: What type of boolean is active?  \nsdumitriu - (22:09): Is it a Boolean xwiki property?  \nabusenius - (22:09): yes  \nsdumitriu - (22:09): Then it's normal  \nabusenius - (22:09): (IMO)  \nsdumitriu - (22:10): Internally boolean is stored as int  \nabusenius - (22:10): ah, ok  \nsdumitriu - (22:10): With 3 possible values  \ncjdelisle` - (22:10): oh yea. forgot about that one.  \nsdumitriu - (22:10): True, False, and Undecided :)  \nabusenius - (22:11): trinary logic rulez :)  \nsdumitriu - (22:12): This reminds me of a \"friend\" that was wondering why all programming languages have only if then else, and not if then else otherwise  \nabusenius - (22:13): sdumitriu: want to take a look at the really fixed LiveTableResults?  \nabusenius - (22:14): oh, and the maven-release-plugin we are currently using works fine with version ranges now, right?  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): Checking, I'm not sure we've upgraded  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): No, we're still using the old one  \nabusenius - (22:24): sdumitriu: will we upgrade in the near future or should I better remove ranges?
