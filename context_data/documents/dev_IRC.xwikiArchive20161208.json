Asked yesterday, but you all seemed busy with an LDAP issue,  \n12:48\u00a0<admin\\_n00b>\u00a0I am having an issue with an extention (ImportDokuWiki). When I upload the data folder, it doesn't find any pages at all.  \n12:48\u00a0<admin\\_n00b>\u00a0I know this is an extension, soyou might not be able to help. But getting this to work will save me hours of work manually transfering hte Wiki pages.  \n13:00\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
