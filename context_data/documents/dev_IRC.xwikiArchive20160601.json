\n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found a workaround...  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by using services.component.getInstance()...  \n15:15\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit

actually  \n15:39\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the code seems to do something but never used this  \n15:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(does not make much sense to me to put that in a \"method\" binding, should probably have a \"component\" binding instead)  \n15:46\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I've foudn this code but it's the injection part not the binding  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie access to the binding name  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah my bad  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I missed the last line  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I don't know why it didn't work  \n15:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the part doing both injection and filling the map that is then put in the biding  \n15:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the code seems legit yes  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway, the workaround worked fine and is actually simpler to use  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one line of groovy vs having to add an xobject  \n15:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should report a jira issue  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I'll try a bit more just ot be sure  \n15:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well it's not exactly the same thing, with injection you indicate that this dependency is required  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's not the same exactly  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the injection is done only once  \n15:52\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n15:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my workaround is called every time  \n15:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should be done only once, this code seems to be called for each method call  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(which is wrong)  \n15:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0various issue around dependencies  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0$issues  \n15:55\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok confirmed  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0raising jira  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think the problem is that it's the key that is bound  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no that's ok actually  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I do have the key bound in the method context  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the value that is null  \n16:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I'm the in the exception case actually  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I do have a warning in the log  \n16:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I know  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm using \"default\" as the hint  \n16:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying without a hint to see if it works better  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah the issue is that it doesn't work with default hints...  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0passing an empty hint is not handled  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reporting

If you want when you are done with the original plan for the GSOC we could imagine working on making the Android authenticator use the OIDC endpoint instead of BASIC auth when available (would make things a lot cleaner with proper access token etc) but since it's only working on recent versions of XWiki and is just an extension I think it's still nice to sup  \n17:02\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:03\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0it's ok :) OIDC may be a good choice to ensure security even though I am not familiar with it.  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's pretty new but it's basically OAuth2 with a endpoint to get user information  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just an idea, we can discuss that later  \n17:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:08\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: so you implemented new displayers for each type of property for the new macro support in CKEditor wiki ?  \n17:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0asking because I would need the same kind of displayer for filter application which have the same properties descriptors than macros  \n17:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I haven't implemented displayers, it's just an IF that checks for some known parameter types https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-ckeditor/blob/master/plugins/src/main/resources/xwiki-macro/macroEditor.js#L161  \n17:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0nothing fancy  \n17:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for now  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok, would be nice at some point to have some kind of displayers extensions associated to the a property type  \n17:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0depends what kind of properties you have in mind. Here I have the macro parameter descriptor  \n17:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you mean the parameter type could be an xproperty type?  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I mean macro parameters can have anything since any extension can provide it's own types as long as it provide corresponding Converter  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm not talking about xproperty  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm talking about the actual type of the property and how to display it and the fact that you can't know all possible types  \n17:22\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:23\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:28\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n17:43\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0hi, Enygma` \u00a0I just want to use the Gallery Macro in the page, but the MacroExecutionException occurred.  \n17:50\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0in this page, http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Android+authenticator/  \n17:51\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0I have uploaded the screenshots, just copied the code  \n17:51\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0don't know why? could some one help me?  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: the error is not about gallery macro but about velocity macro  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you will have to list the attachment explciitly  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0script macro are not allowed in extensions pages right now  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like in the first example of http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Gallery+Macro  \n17:54\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0yes, I followed the link and copied the velocity code in the extension page. it can't work.  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes but the first example does not use Velocity, it just list attachments  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in your case it's ok since you know the attachments, just need to copy pasted the names  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/pasted/paste/  \n17:56\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:57\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0ok, I have a try :) .  \n18:01\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:04\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0it's ok, but it seems loading the images very slowly.  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not load them at all for me  \n18:06\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you sure you used the right names ?  \n18:08\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0yes, I am sure. I think, maybe because of the image resolution  \n18:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0fitz: fixed it. http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Android+authenticator/ You had an extra space after \"image:\".  \n18:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0a good opportunity to check out XWiki`s image syntax http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax#HImages ;)  \n18:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the macro should be more explicit about things it cannot find instead of loading  \n18:10\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0oh, I see. thank you very much!  \n18:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0thank you too. now I was able to follow the images :) nice  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: looks like you are the star of fitz's screenshots :)  \n18:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I noticed it :P  \n18:20\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0note that I were the GSoC t-shirt in that photo, although it's not visible :P  \n18:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: when i'm done logging in and I choose \"complete\" the synchronization is not enabled, I have to go to the account and explicitly enable contact synchronization  \n18:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would have expected it to be enabled by default  \n18:28\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0yes, default it's \"Don't Sync\" because maybe there're lots of users in the server.  \n18:29\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0and I don't know if the user want to synchronize all the users.  \n18:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm wait I think i did not choose the synchronization mode, I just tough \"complete\" button means \"full\" synchronization :)  \n18:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the mode is empty for me rigth now  \n18:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should maybe select \"Don't sync\" by default so that it's more clear  \n18:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually the synchronizaton type does not work for me  \n18:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it stay empty  \n18:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha no it just take a long time to load the groups it seems  \n18:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think some message saying its loading the groups is missing here :)  \n18:33\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0yes, it's slow. Maybe I should optimize the solr query and http request. :)  \n18:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0before optimize you should display something to make clear it's doing something  \n18:35\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0ok, I will update soon. thank you very much for helping me test the app.  \n18:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have a graphical bug on Android 4.4.4, the application takes the whole screen but the standard Android top bar and buttons are still displayed so I end up with Android home button on top of the application buttons for example and I have to turn the phone to click on \"Complete\"  \n18:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: will create a jira issue with a screenshot  \n18:37\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0ok, and I will test again with the genymotion android emulator.  \n18:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: you should release 0.2 version on Jira so that people can indicate which version they are refering to when creating an issue  \n18:39\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:41\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/ANDAUTH-15  \n18:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: re the version you can create and release them on http://jira.xwiki.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/ANDAUTH/versions  \n18:44\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0ok, thank you very much!  \n18:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: about the groups that are slow to load, you should probably separate the sync mode and the group selection in two separate configurations (for example in my case I don't care about the groups I just want everyone)  \n18:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but even when I selecet \"Sync all user\" it looks like I have to wait for the groups  \n18:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0creating a jira issue, will be easier to follow for you  \n18:47\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0I just released the 0.2 version on Jira.  \n18:47\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0I will optimize ASAP :).  \n18:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: ok thanks  \n18:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: you created the version but you did not \"released\" it  \n18:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0put your move over the version line and you should get an option icon in which you can do release  \n18:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0forget that  \n18:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you did, I just tried it too quickly :)  \n18:49\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:56\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0tmortagne, thanks a lot.  \n18:56\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0but I should go to sleep:). it's 0:53. see you!  \n18:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: sure  \n18:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if I get anything else I will directly put it on jira  \n18:59\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:10\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<gene>\u00a0has quit  \n19:13\u00a0<gene>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:24\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:50\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:09\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:23\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:44\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:53\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:04\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:09\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n21:24\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:29\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n21:42\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n21:48\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has quit  \n22:03\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:07\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n22:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:22\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:28\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n22:43\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:47\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n22:58\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n23:02\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:08\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n23:21\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:26\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit  \n23:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:41\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:47\u00a0<codesmithKarl>\u00a0has quit\n"}
