The log is missing because the Continue button was not clicked.  \n10:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in other words, the click on the Continue button had no effect  \n10:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for some reason  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what do we do about it? who looks into it?  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is the same for the 6 failing tests?  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems so  \n10:33\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm maybe not  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0expected:<[]installed> but was:<[remote-]installed>  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that looks different  \n10:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0proposal sent, please answer  \n10:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0same, the button was not clicked. But that is not the only issue. Other tests may fail because after you click on Install (or other action) the extension cannot be found anymore..  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the continue button was not clicked (not there for ex) we would have an error before no?  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it means it's clicked probably  \n10:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the button is there  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we're missing some wait maybe for the next content ot show up?  \n10:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but the click has no effect  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*to  \n10:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0there is a wait  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see any reason other than the wait is not working  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you?  \n10:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, the button may be moved up/down while the page is loaded or the extension display is updated and this confuses selenium. When using native events, Selenium computes the position of the button and then fires a native click event at that position. If the button moves in the mean time then the click has no effect.  \n10:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Selenium tries to simulate as much as possible the user behaviour. The same can happen for the user if we move the button right when she wants to click on it  \n10:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0another reason could be that the button is disabled, although the tests waits for the button to become enabled  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we're not doing the findElement just before the click and we're doing it too early and if it changes position we'd need a new findElement  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so selenium will succeed to click even if the button has been moved?  \n10:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0maybe. there are a few findElementWithoutWait used in the PO  \n11:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n11:26\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n11:28\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:28\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:01\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:13\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n12:14\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:16\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n12:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n12:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I notice that XWiki.XWikiPreferences is in 2 locations now  \n12:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0xwiki-enterprise-ui-admin-user that is used in the main wiki  \n12:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and xwiki-enterprise-ui-wiki that is used in subwikis  \n12:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0why was this done?  \n12:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0to be able to specify rights in the main wiki for the admin group?  \n12:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if that is the only reason, shouldn`t we have used a transformation at build time and add those rights instead of forking XWikiPreferences?  \n12:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so having XWikiPreferences in enterprise-ui-common and on enterprise-ui-mainwiki just have that transformation to end up with a modified document in the xar  \n13:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Hi Enygma`  \n13:23\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0A transformation during the build would be better indeed  \n13:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0By the time I did this, I did not know the transformation plugin  \n13:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it would be really better  \n13:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, since the user module has nothing to do with preferences and if you want to extend/transform XWikiPreferences you are forced to depend on user, which might not be nice  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XE-1461  \n14:01\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:03\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n14:10\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has quit  \n14:11\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:39\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol1: did you checkout automatic SASL auth ?

First of all, XWiki needs at least Java 7 to run, so any server which has Java installed should do the trick  \n22:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0here is a guide on how to install it: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation  \n22:37\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0sburjan: how can i tell if my server has java installed? i've viewed that guide, thanks.  \n22:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0are you running on a windows or linux system ?  \n22:38\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0it's a webhost  \n22:38\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0i don't know what their server is based on  \n22:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0then you should see which services you have available from your host  \n22:39\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0What should I ask them specifically? if they have java installed?  \n22:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Well I think this depends on the service you bought from them. Which you know better than I do. You should see what is included.  \n22:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0what plan do you have ? Essential, Wordpress, VPS or Dedicated ?  \n22:45\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0They just told me I need the VPS plan to run Tomcat  \n22:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0seems so, yes  \n22:46\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0$20 a month, not a viable option for me  \n22:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, usually java is more expensive than PHP hosting  \n22:47\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0Why is that?  \n22:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well because php is much more lightwight than java regarding resources, especially RAM  \n22:49\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0i see  \n22:49\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0i might just have to go with a wiki that runs on PHP then..  \n22:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0you can ask for a wiki from the xwiki.org if that's okay with you. I don't know exactly the terms and conditions  \n22:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0you could have an xwiki instance like kyndel.myxwiki.org  \n22:50\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0do you know if it's possible to have secured pages with that service?  \n22:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0please check http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome  \n22:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0what do you mean by secured ?  \n22:51\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0i mean to set permission for viewing a particular page that require users to be logged in to their account  \n22:51\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0of course, yes. It's secured  \n22:51\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0how long would it take to get set up on that service?  \n22:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0follow the instructions on the link I gave you and send an e-amil to the userslist  \n22:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0shouldn't take too long, depending on the availability of the devs. around 2-3 days  \n22:53\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0ok i'll check it out. thank you  \n22:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yw  \n22:54\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:08\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0has quit  \n23:26\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:26\u00a0<kyndel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
