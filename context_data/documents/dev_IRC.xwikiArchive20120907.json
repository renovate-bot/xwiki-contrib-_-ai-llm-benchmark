I can think of: creating an AbstracAllTests, creating a Suite extending PageObjectSuite, modifying PageObjectSuite. What's the best solution?  \n08:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where do we need to skip it?  \n08:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in platform's functional tests only right?  \n08:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually not even there  \n08:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0no, in enterprise tests too  \n08:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since they don't start with an empty wiki  \n08:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it doesn't matter  \n08:04\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the wizard appears even if the wiki is not empty, if there is not previous state of the distribution  \n08:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm maybe that's the problem  \n08:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would we want this?  \n08:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's bad  \n08:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0because we don't know what is installed  \n08:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n08:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do we need to knoww hat's installed if the user doesn't want an upgrade  \n08:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n08:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0how do you know the user wants an upgrade?  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when he goes to the admin to import or to the EM maybe  \n08:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0since there is no previous state of the distribution you don't know if it's an upgrade or not  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok I understand  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0his wiki may not work if the war has been changed  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it needs to be the first thing that happens  \n08:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right?  \n08:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n08:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the solution for us  \n08:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to have the xar version and the war version in sync for the functional tests  \n08:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no?  \n08:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either that or set that config flag  \n08:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm not sure the sync will help  \n08:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: vmassol is asking if it's normal to get the distribution wizard on a new instance of XE  \n08:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you mean a new instance of hsqldb/jetty distribution ?  \n08:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and if there are ways to void this instead of using the configuration flag  \n08:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n08:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0right now it's normal yes simply because the distribution module think you did not installed the UI since it does not find it  \n08:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0marking the imported xar as installed is not done yet right?  \n08:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbiab  \n08:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I mean, we won't need the configuration flag anymore when the imported xar will be marked as installed.  \n08:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n08:17\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm, but the problem is that we import enterprise-ui-all not enterprise-ui with its deps..  \n08:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n08:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0back, my connection is almost unusable this morning (just moved on my phone)  \n08:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0re jetty/hsqldb: the main issue is that between the project actually building the database and the one creating the distribution the information about installed extensions is lost  \n08:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0guys: slf4j 1.7.0 released with \"This version adds varargs support in Logger methods.\" that will be nice ;)  \n08:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:59\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r5f82928\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5f82928607dd7872259265feb917136009e7c34e \u000f/ (5 files in 3 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7896: Display a global install/upgrade wizard when starting an new version of an XWiki instance - http://git.io/AUeZSg  \n09:02\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Marius Dumitru Florea\u000f master\u000f \\* r6b37662\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/commit/6b37662f3ec8ac4665a49ad04a13d97264708cb3 \u000f/ (2 files in 2 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7896: Display a global install/upgrade wizard when starting an new version of an XWiki instance - http://git.io/tnblTg  \n09:02\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n09:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:20\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r6a06028\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/commit/6a06028e506e8fa8f950a983c76963db6f0cf5c9 \u000f/ xwiki-enterprise-distribution/xwiki-enterprise-ui-all/pom.xml :\u000f Add missing virtual extensions - http://git.io/sd34ZA  \n09:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0looks like commits don't trigger CI builds anymore..  \n09:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: ping  \n10:00\u00a0<CIA-121>\u00a0Denis Gervalle\u000f stable-4.1.x\u000f \\* rf58d3de\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/f58d3de9a468d770b5695a8fd551c2a08e7edf13 \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/pom.xml :\u000f Clean up CLIRR exclusions after 4.1.4 release - http://git.io/eybl5Q  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well done Denis for your second release! :)  \n10:06\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0are we going to put 4.1.4 on myxwiki before we can say it's recommended ?
