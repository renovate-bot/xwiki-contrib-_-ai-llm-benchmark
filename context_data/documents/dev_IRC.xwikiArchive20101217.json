I'm done with my meeting so I can help now  \n18:19\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: i've created a groovy scriptand tested on localhost and worked. But I was unable to run it on extensions. And the code snipper is at the office, I don't have it  \n18:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0sburjan`: It is fixed in 2.7RC1  \n18:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0sburjan`: extensions.xwiki.org is on 2.6  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's 2 line velocity script sburjan`. I can do it  \n18:20\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0oh yes.. forgor  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just give me the pages  \n18:20\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: I wasn't able to do it in Velocity. the set method didn;t work  \n18:21\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0sburjan`: Debugged the \"create page\" js error in IE7 ( http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Test/27snapshots#HJSerrorwhenCreatingaPage28:7C29 )  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's because you need $doc.document.setCreator()  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you call $doc.save(\"Set missing creator\", true)  \n18:22\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: didn;t found the setCreator() method in public API in Velocity  \n18:22\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0afair only groovy has it  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not public  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a privileged api  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$doc.document means Document.getDocument()  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which returns a XWikiDocument object  \n18:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which has the full API (privilged)  \n18:23\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0sdumitriu: great .. I was starting to think that the machines are broken and I reported bogus IE problems  \n18:23\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I didn;t find the method in javadoc  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not there, but it(s not listed for groovye ither!  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you still found it  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:23\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0flavius helped me :)  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they are the exact same APIs  \n18:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's only one java code  \n18:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie a single API for all scripts  \n18:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan`: \"afair only groovy has it\" there is no such thing as groovy specific API the is only API you have access or not whatever the language, the difference is that if you are doing groovy then you have programming right by definition  \n18:24\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0sburjan`: IE7 is so stupid, $('space') return <meta name=\"space\"> instead of <input id=\"space\">  \n18:24\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In which universe does getElementById checks the name attribute?  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: ok I'll let you finish tomorrow. Just don't forget to call save as I mentioned above  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the true is for minor edit)  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$doc.document.setCreator(\"\u2026.\")  \n18:25\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0ok. If I run into problems I'll write. But I think I'll do it monday  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$doc.save(\"Set missing creator\", true)  \n18:26\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I never used the API, I don't know it, I'll have to get some coaching from Oana  \n18:26\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0and after I save the script, it will get execute during refresh  \n18:26\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0and after that, I can delete it, right ?  \n18:27\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0my toes are shaking.. cold outside .. and I'm dislexic  \n18:27\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0and fingers  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: as I said earlier don't save the page!  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just use preview  \n18:28\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0only with priew, tried that.. no succes :)  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it'll get executed but not saved  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it works I can assure you  \n18:28\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0okay .. I belive you :)  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: sharpening your python skills? :)  \n18:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: yea well I still have the impression I'm a bull in a china shop with python, I need to get proper training from the start  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going home\u2026 going to brave the snow  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sdumitriu: I can't find a way to write opacity for IE7 using valid CSS. Maybe CSS character escapes will work. iirc CSS parser was complaining about the equal sign opacity=70. Maybe escaping \\hex the equal sign will work but i don't have time to test now. I'll investigate more during the weekend.  \n19:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:14\u00a0<camaritei>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:39\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0has quit  \n21:41\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n21:42\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:46\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n22:52\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
