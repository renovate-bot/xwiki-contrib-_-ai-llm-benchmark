 \n17:09\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Since usually, all the functions are supported?  \n17:09\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I'm almost sure I'm missing something here but I can't have it clear in my mind...  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0our component system only allows implementing one api  \n17:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(for example, XWikiManagerScriptService implements ScriptService but not XWikiManager)  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should implement the business interface  \n17:10\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Ah, ok, this is a technical limitation then  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's registered against the CM under the ScriptService role  \n17:11\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I was not expecting this kind of answer :-P  \n17:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also usually script service job is to check for rights before colling the actual API  \n17:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/colling/calling/  \n17:12\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0tmortagne: What you mean is that it's not exactly the same purpose (and then, in a design point of view, it should not implement)?  \n17:13\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0even if in reality, almost all functions are reproduce  \n17:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I mean is that script service job is supposed to be a script oriented filter in front of the actual API, being related to right or error management which are a bit different in script usually etc  \n17:13\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(I didn't make an exhaustive check !)  \n17:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the method are reproduce of many of them have right tests you don't want internally  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0woshilapin: the siganture are not the same if that's what you mean  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*signatures  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my answer was on a different level  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not sure what you're asking precsiely :)  \n17:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, both of the answers interest me  \n17:15\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I think, indirectly, you answer my question  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example:  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0WikiManager  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is a Java API  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not a scripting API  \n17:15\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, but I don't see the difference  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the java api will throw exceptions  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the scripting API won't  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it'll return null  \n17:15\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, but Velocity can catch them too now, right?  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it can but it's not how we implemented the contracts so far and we haven't changed that  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another example  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in velocity we cannot do a new  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can have some params that are hard to construct from velocity  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we need a different ways of passing them  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(different signature)  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we usually try to have soe automatic converters for that  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*some  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you can do is check the mail sender api  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that we have introduced recently  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll see it's compltely different from the Java API  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because what you can do in Java is different from how you express things easily in velocity  \n17:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Mail+Sender+API  \n17:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Thanks, I think this can help me to understand  \n17:20\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I was mainly looking into the WikiManager for now  \n17:20\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, thanks tmortagne and vmassol, I will not lose too many of your time, thanks for the answers  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yw  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0woshilapin: you have a lot of right checking in WikiManagerScriptService  \n17:21\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0tmortagne: Yes, but the signature are almost the same  \n17:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the signature yes but the behavior is not  \n17:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it can't be the same implementation  \n17:32\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n17:59\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: ping skype  \n18:03\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:34\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:00\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:19\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:58\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n21:37\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:39\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:43\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:46\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:46\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n22:47\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has quit  \n23:14\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
