How do you expect the root to be a space when the tree doesn't show spaces?  \n12:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the root must be a node that the tree normally displays. i.e. consider the tree without the root parameter, see what nodes are displayed, use one of those nodes as root  \n12:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if the tree doesn't show spaces without the root parameter then there's no point in setting the root to a space  \n12:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the root is used to display a subtree of the tree displayed without the root parameter  \n12:26\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, i wonder how did i miss it  \n12:26\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0thanks  \n13:29\u00a0<Trefex\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:31\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n13:43\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n14:48\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:47\u00a0<Trefex\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<Trefex\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:54\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:20\u00a0<Trefex\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<Trefex\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:15\u00a0<Trefex\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<Trefex\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:53\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:58\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:12\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:18\u00a0<Trefex\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit\n"}
