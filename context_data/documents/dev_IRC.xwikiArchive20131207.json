Like in MediaWiki: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Approved\\_Revs  \n09:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ccatY: maybe http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XWiki+Publication+Workflow+Application  \n09:27\u00a0<ccatY>\u00a0Thx for your reply. This is the best match we found, too - but it is much more complicated than an approved revision process. Could this be solved with an custom component? I have no idea how to manipulate the rendered revision on viewing the page.  \n09:30\u00a0<ccatY>\u00a0Something like a \"hook\" an view mode.  \n09:30\u00a0<ccatY>\u00a0\"hook on view mode\" (sorry)  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ccatY: yes you can do that easily by scripting it. I don't guarantee performances though  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hold on  \n09:46\u00a0<ccatY>\u00a0i do :-)  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ccatY: for example: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA?viewer=code  \n09:52\u00a0<ccatY>\u00a0thx, I'll have a look, mom  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another example with the current doc: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA2?viewer=code  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a better way of course in order to not change the doc's content  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hold on  \n09:55\u00a0<ccatY>\u00a0i do again (thx in advance)  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here you go: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA2  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you check this page content, it's: \u00a0http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMA2?viewer=code  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it displays \"original content\"  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is thanks to an xobject it has attached of type VMAClass that I have created at http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMAClass  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then I have a sheet at http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/VMASheet  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and a classsheetbinding in VMAClass  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry I have to go and not much time to explain, how you can google and find some explanations  \n10:00\u00a0<ccatY>\u00a0Thx very much!
