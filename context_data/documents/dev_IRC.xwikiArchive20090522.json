 \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:13): I don't think any of the remaining stuff is important  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:14): one was to add news (related to this blog feature) and the one above news with no identifiable title header ... appears to be a custom entry that's not pulling data from any speical area  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:15): bulleted items such as \"Service Outage Analysis>Main.SOA\", \"Business Continuity Planning.Home\"  \nsdumitriu - (22/05/2009 02:16): You can create a new panel for that, or you can edit the QuickLinks panel to add those links in it  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:27): ok, let me save what I have from the default selection and work on that  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:34): hmm, for the first bulleted item \"Service Outage Analysis.Home\", it shows up on the first bullet as \"Service Outage Analysis\" and the second bulleted item is \"Home\"  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:34): which should be \"Business Continuity Planning.Home\"  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:35): http://pastebin.com/m7fc2007f  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:35): there's the code  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:37): http://yfrog.com/5einfojp  \nkraze - (22/05/2009 02:37): there's a screenshot  \nsdumitriu - (22/05/2009 02:39): What is the original code?
