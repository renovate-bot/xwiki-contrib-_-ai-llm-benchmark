However, on every page you can choose to switch between the different language translations that exist for that page. To do so click on the language name in the top right corner of the screen as shown in the following screenshots. Note that you can also force a language by suffixing a URL with language=<2-letter language code>. In addition you can [configure your wiki to always use a specific language or force a single language to be used](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Configuration/).\n\n![LanguageEN.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/I18N/LanguageEN.png?rev=1.4)\u00a0<-*English* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Deutsch*-> ![LanguageDE.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/I18N/LanguageDE.png?rev=1.4)\n\nOnce you click on a language, you're forcing it and thus all pages which have translations in that language will display these translations by default when you navigate to them.\n\n# Page translations\n\nThe *title* and *content* of a wiki page can be translated in multiple locales. For this you need to configure your wiki to be multilingual and set the list of supported locales. Once you do this XWiki will try to show you the title and content of the page translation that matches the current user interface locale. If the page has not been translated yet then XWiki will show you the title and content from the original version of the page. You can check the [Information tab](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DocumentLifecycle/) at the bottom of the page to see the locale of the current page, its original locale, as well as the list of existing and missing page translations. You can use the links to access the available page translations or to create the missing ones.\n\nXWiki 13.2+, 12.10.5+\u00a0You can also use the Translate page button to start creating the missing translation. It opens either the [in-place editor](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing) or it takes you to the stand-alone editor (Wiki or WYSIWYG) depending on your preferences.\n\n![translatePageButton.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/I18N/translatePageButton.png?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\n# Edit a translation\n\nWhen editing a plain wiki page the editor will load:\n\n* the page translation that corresponds to the current laguage, if it exists and multilingual is on\n* otherwise, the original page\n\nWhen editing a structured page the editor will load the original page because the structured data (objects) are shared by all page translations.\n\nFrom Wiki and WYSIWYG edit modes, as well as when editing in-place, you can switch to a different page translation or create a missing translation.\n\nWhen editing in-place you get a \"Translate\" button if the edited page doesn't have a translation for the current locale. Click on the \"Translate\" button if you wish to create the missing translation, otherwise all the changes you do will be saved to the original version of the page.\n\n![edit-inplace-new-translation.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/I18N/edit-inplace-new-translation.png?rev=1.1)\n\nFrom the Wiki and WYSIWYG edit modes you are able to edit the default (original) page language. The default language is indicated on the right \"Document Information\" panel as shown below:\n\n![DefaultLanguageEN.PNG](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/I18N/DefaultLanguageEN.PNG?rev=1.3)\n\nIn the \"Document Translations\" panel you can see the current language you are performing translations in and the alternative languages you may translate your page to. These are the languages you have previously set up in \"Administration\".\n\n![DocumentTranslations.PNG](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/I18N/DocumentTranslations.PNG?rev=1.3)\n\nIn order to translate your document in a different language, click on one of the languages (e.g. Fr). As a result you will see the edition mode translated in that language.\n\n![DefaultLanguageFR.PNG](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/I18N/DefaultLanguageFR.PNG?rev=1.4)\n\nOnce you save a document in one of the languages, that document becomes the original document and the language it is written in becomes the default language.\n\n![OriginalLanguage.PNG](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/I18N/OriginalLanguage.PNG?rev=1.3)\n\nNote that all translations of one page share the same set of XWiki objects. As a result it is impossible to have different objects (and page tags, which are objects too) in different translations for now, but it is planed in next versions.\n\n\n"}
