Please come to our mailing lists for help about how to do this.\" but a lot has changed since 2.1.1....  \nnpm - (18:06): i saw some Q's on the ML about this... i didn't realize XwikiWatch had been updated to handle \"2.0\" at all.  \ncjdelisle - (18:07): I seem to recall from when I removed the old captcha plugin that it did build with 2.x.  \nnpm - (18:07): i guess i'll have to try it out... the person on the ML seemed to be having problems  \nnpm - (18:08): (hi caleb, thanks for answering!)  \ncjdelisle - (18:08): no pb  \ncjdelisle - (18:09): Other people would probably know more but I seem to recall I could get it to build.  \ncjdelisle - (18:09): s/probably// \u00a0;)  \nnpm - (18:10): i've been busy w/ a few other things of late http://mudita24.googlecode.com and http://spekle.googlecode.com but will need to integrate it back into my project in xwiki  \nnpm - (18:12): btw, now that i wish i could do all my java programming in Vala, i noticed there were mysql bindings to db, and i figured out how to get it to spew json so i might just be firing off vala to do some of my \"crunching\" (it's really fast because it's basically C)  \ncjdelisle - (18:13): vala looks neat. like java without the 1 second start time.  \ncjdelisle - (18:13): and less portable  \nnpm - (18:14): sort of... it runs on any thing linux runs on. like a linux powered car entertainment center  \nnpm - (18:14): i just compiled my program on my son's meego-based netbook for example, and it's just as easily available on MIPS for a set-top box  \narkub left at 18:15 (Quit: Leaving  \ncjdelisle - (18:15): I am building a new computer, hot an asux mb with no onboard sound chip.

I'm not really big on overclocking, I want months of uptime I don't care about a couple hundred Mhz.  \nnpm - (18:47): well i just mean w/r/t/ dooing unapproved things like unlocking cpu's that supposedly aren't there  \ncjdelisle - (18:47): The trick would be figuring out which cpu was burnt.  \nnpm - (18:48): which is like overclocking because it generates more heat, but can also be from a bad yield where it just takes an out of spec amount of power/heat to run the chip  \ncjdelisle - (18:48): I will be running primes and superPi before I start trusting it though.  \nnpm - (18:49): usually a good idea to burn it for a week or so just to make sure...  \nnpm - (18:49): but usually better to buy the last release cycle's top chip  \ncjdelisle - (18:50): >$1000  \nnpm - (18:50): i got my amd's right around the time intel had released the i7's and the prices on the amds dropped  \nnpm - (18:50): so it was like $190  \ncjdelisle - (18:50): nice.  \ncjdelisle - (18:51): $300 for this thing.  \ncjdelisle - (18:51): Opteron 6128  \nnpm - (18:51): ah, opty... nice  \ncjdelisle - (18:51): Probably could have found it cheaper but then can ya trust the supplier\"  \nnpm - (18:52): is that a 6-core?  \ncjdelisle - (18:52): 8  \nnpm - (18:52): eek  \nnpm - (18:52): well that's not \"only 2.0Ghz\" :-) then  \nnpm - (18:52): with the right languages it's 16Ghz !  \ncjdelisle - (18:52): 2 4core dies on one module. weird.  \ncjdelisle - (18:53): For a processor, it weighs a ton.  \nnpm - (18:53): i wouldn't do any unlocking on the optys  \nnpm - (18:53): i thought you had their consumer stuff  \ncjdelisle - (18:53): I figured they wouldn't be selling crap to big biz.  \ncjdelisle - (18:54): Same with all the other stuff, reputation counts more for server stuff.  \nnpm - (18:54): sure, although a lot of time it's just an excuse to sell last years slower crap repackaged in a rackmount :-)  \ncjdelisle - (18:55): \"last years slower crap\" it's 2 opto 2000 dies on one module.  \ncjdelisle - (18:55): so that's about it.  \nnpm - (18:56): heh  \ncjdelisle - (18:57): in other news:  \ncjdelisle - (18:57): http://www.amazon.com/Denon-AKDL1-Dedicated-Link-Cable/product-reviews/B000I1X6PM/ref=cm\\_cr\\_pr\\_hist\\_5?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&filterBy=addFiveStar  \ncjdelisle - (18:58): The reviews are awesome.  \nnpm - (18:58): love the reviews  \ncjdelisle - (18:58): This is the opto6100 http://info.nuje.de/mcm.jpg  \ncjdelisle - (19:00): Do you know if AMD is still using a risc backend with a cisc->risc translator?  \ncjdelisle - (19:01): Pretty sure that was the case with the K6.  \nnpm - (19:05): hmmm... \u00a0i haven't heard that. i'm pretty sure they just appropriated risc pipelining concepts into their existing hi txistor count designs  \ncjdelisle - (19:06): I may be wrong, I did look at die shots and the intels seem to have a lot of space which is not accounted for.  \nnpm - (19:07): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD is a pretty good description  \ncjdelisle - (19:07): I read an article from an ex intel guy who said their arch is a huge mess. Trying to understand how AMD can avoid the junk silicon for all of those rarely used IA32 instructions.  \nnpm - (19:08): amd's arch, or intel's?  \ncjdelisle - (19:08): intel's arch is supposedly a mess.  \nflaviusolaru left at 19:08 (Quit: Leaving.  \ncjdelisle - (19:09): --> can't produce a low power consumption laptop offering.  \nnpm - (19:09): atom?  \ncjdelisle - (19:09): Don't know much about it but I've heard it didn't live up to expectations.  \nnpm - (19:09): and via software, http://meego.com  \nnpm - (19:10): my son's netbook runs pretty snappy  \nnpm - (19:10): w/ a 1.6G dual atom  \ncjdelisle - (19:10): One thing I have to say for intel is they can invest a huge amount of R&D $$$ to make stuff fast.  \nnpm - (19:10): and he can go for a few days w/o plugging it in  \ncjdelisle - (19:11): That's a major improvement over my last laptop.  \ncjdelisle - (19:11): p3  \nnpm - (19:11): or my 3.4G P4 \"lap burner\"  \ncjdelisle - (19:12): Of course it probably doesn't run 24/7.  \ncjdelisle - (19:12): [user@fc9p4 applications]$ uptime  \ncjdelisle - (19:12): \u00a013:24:31 up 46 days, 15:36, \u00a07 users, \u00a0load average: 0.26, 0.21, 0.18  \nnpm - (19:12): nope, but it could probably run all day, perhaps not compiling though  \ncjdelisle - (19:13): load averages are pretty sad given it seems underpowered.  \nnpm - (19:13): so it looks like you been busy in crypto land... i hope to look at all the changes soon  \nnpm - (19:14): once i get out of \"back end\" devel  \ncjdelisle - (19:15): yea, it's pretty cool. Works with FF crypto.signText so you can do challange/response auth.  \ncjdelisle - (19:15): I suppose you saw http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/CryptographicModule  \nnpm - (19:16): that's what i was talking about  \nnpm - (19:16): very helpful  \ncjdelisle - (19:16): brag brag brag brag :)  \nnpm - (19:16): cool when it's fully integrated into xwiki as an option  \nnpm - (19:17): whhat's the timeframe for that, or is that already available?  \ncjdelisle - (19:17): 2.5M1 the apis are there.  \nnpm - (19:17): i guess you're going to use it for passwords first right?  \nnpm - (19:18): in the db  \ncjdelisle - (19:18): Protection of passwords is a pain because the output is pretty big.  \ncjdelisle - (19:18): ~1000 chars of base64  \ncjdelisle - (19:18): the password field is limited to 255  \nnpm - (19:19): ouch  \ncjdelisle - (19:19): It's a java serialized class.  \nnpm - (19:19): thus the change to longstrings  \nnpm - (19:20): perhaps there needs to be a hack to allow extra indirection to a separate table w/ a lookup?  \ncjdelisle - (19:21): It's also a pain because all old password hashes are stored in the document history table.  \ncjdelisle - (19:22): Another option might be to give each user a cert and the password is used to encrypt the private key.  \ncjdelisle - (19:22): Signatures on scripts are in the pipe. Should be an option for only giving PR to code which has a valid signature.  \ncjdelisle - (19:23): All known and not yet known PR security issues will be fixed at once.  \nnpm - (19:29): i actually like that the best. i think that would put xwiki out way ahead of the crowd, to use all it's fine java underpinning to leverage existing code that'll run a \"mini CA\" built into each Xwiki  \nnpm - (19:30): last i looked into that, it required a potentially hairy install of a cert, which is browser dependent  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 19:30  \nnpm - (19:30): (it's essentially one of the big issues we had in setting up HP's \"collaborative development program\" on top of collabnet's sourcecast)  \ncjdelisle - (19:31): The really cool part is that you can sign the script with a client cert in the browser (crypto.signText) so it's conceivable to just stop trusting the server entirely.  \nnpm - (19:31): however, it was done because HP's security fiat's also dictated which browsers were supported and that was that  \ncjdelisle - (19:32): yea, signText is not supported in chrome and it takes some trickery to get signing in IE.  \nnpm - (19:32): self-signing  \nnpm - (19:32): ?  \nnpm - (19:32): were basically intead of the server being the possessor of secret key, it's the client?  \ncjdelisle - (19:32): that's it.  \ncjdelisle - (19:33): The dirty truth is that the server has to generate a root CA for each client has to trust it in order to be able to sign with their own key.  \nnpm - (19:33): i was going to ask if chrome/safari/konqueror supported ti  \nnpm - (19:33): it  \ncjdelisle - (19:33): I don't think it's in webkit at all. That's not a huge issue because the server can hold the private key.  \nnpm - (19:34): and have that installed in a browser dependent manner.... that was probably the hardest part of what we did for HP  \ncjdelisle - (19:34): If the private key goes on the server, it's protected with the user's password.  \ncjdelisle - (19:35): Using scrypt KDF and CAST-5 cipher. Use a decent password and nobody's going to read that key.  \nnpm - (19:35): definitely the right way, but if it makes people do to many new things (and they're not forced to by reason of keeping their jobs) there's resistance  \ncjdelisle - (19:36): If the key's on the server, it's possible to make it invisible to the user.  \ncjdelisle - (19:37): also installing a key in the browser is not nearly as onerous as you might think. the <keygen> tag makes it 1 click.  \nnpm - (19:37): i see.  \nnpm - (19:37): true, we did that back when less supported  \ncjdelisle - (19:37): + 2 clicks to install the CA.  \ncjdelisle - (19:38): because FF needs a CA to trust \\_itself\\_!  \nnpm - (19:38): http://www.networkworld.com/news/2001/0611hpcollab.html is when we had to do all this  \nfm joined #xwiki at 19:39  \ncjdelisle - (19:39): I will read that (tabbed). \u00a0If I get ambitious, I'll add PGP support. There's PGP for javascript so you could encrypt form submissions (invisably).  \nnpm - (19:40): that would also be cool.  \ncjdelisle - (19:40): + imagine CC#'s pgp encrypted with a key that's not on the server. When an order is made, the ciphertext is sent to billing.  \nnpm - (19:40): and the ability to mail in PGP signed submissions or changes to the wiki  \ncjdelisle - (19:41): Could mail in changes, PGP JS implementation makes it invisible to the user.  \ncjdelisle - (19:42): haha pgp encrypt the password form :D  \ncjdelisle - (19:43): err login form  \ntmortagne left at 20:27 (Quit: Leaving.  \nxipe left at 20:43 (Quit: leaving  \nxipe joined #xwiki at 20:51  \nlpereira joined #xwiki at 21:11  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 21:21  \nabusenius - (21:34): hi @all  \nabusenius - (21:34): does somebody know what Panels/\\*Rights\\* are for?  \nabusenius - (21:35): I can't find them in the list of all panels  \ncjdelisle - (21:41): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-1002  \ncjdelisle - (21:42): I'm working on that now, they should be the same as the panel document IMO.  \ncjdelisle - (21:42): oh hah. misread.  \nabusenius - (21:54): the rights panels I'm reffering to look useles to me, especially without the old rights interface aka XWIKI-5466  \nMartinCleaver left at 21:55 (Quit: MartinCleaver  \nflorinciu left at 21:55 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nabusenius - (21:56): and I always have a strong desire to remove old and useles stuff ^^  \ncjdelisle - (22:00): http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/10/adobe\\_security\\_analysis/ A town nearby to be referenced in the register. Usually everywhere within 50 miles of me gets 0 press.  \nabusenius - (22:10): cjdelisle: how do you plan to fix XWIKI-1002? special handling for panels?  \ncjdelisle - (22:11): same as 2110 except I have to figure out how to make $doc correct.  \nsdumitriu - (22:15): You can't  \nsdumitriu - (22:15): The right approach is to change how PR works  \ncjdelisle - (22:16): can't?  \ncjdelisle - (22:16): Shouldn't permissions be evaluated in the context of the panel doc itself?  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): A piece of script should know at all times, for each line of code that's executed:  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): - in which document or template the code is  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): - what is the current context document  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): - what is the root context document  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): If the code is in a template, PR not granted  \nsdumitriu - (22:17): Otherwise PR = code document has PR AND current context document has PR  \ncjdelisle - (22:18): \"in which document or template the code is\" this is impossible.  \nsdumitriu - (22:18): Only one of those is not enough  \nsdumitriu - (22:18): No it's not  \nsdumitriu - (22:18): Why would it be?  \ncjdelisle - (22:18): It's like DRM. There's always a way around because the logic isn't sound.  \nsdumitriu - (22:19): We already tell velocity in which document it is when using getRenderedContent  \ncjdelisle - (22:19): Except that it doesn't work.  \nsdumitriu - (22:19): Well, yeah, you can falsify that in Groovy, but if Groovy is executing you already have PR  \nsdumitriu - (22:20): It doesn't work now because we don't always tell it the right thing  \ncjdelisle - (22:20): IMO the answer is code is signed or code is not signed. If it's not signed then it's not PR.  \ncjdelisle - (22:21): trust xwiki-crypto or trust xwiki-core, that's the choice.  \nsdumitriu - (22:21): Yep, that's good too  \nsdumitriu - (22:21): But then why do you want a fix for 1002?  \ncjdelisle - (22:22): Because the certificate infrastructure won't be finished for 2.5Final.  \ncjdelisle - (22:22): And I found a way to fix it.  \nsdumitriu - (22:25): OK, go ahead and try  \ncjdelisle - (22:27): btw: Thanks a lot for finding my mistake with the the commit.  \ncjdelisle - (22:27): I have no idea what api.XWiki.createDocument is for but boy it sure was handy for this.  \nabusenius - (22:28): btw sdumitriu, do you know what Panels/RightsEditorWelcome & Co are used for?  \nsdumitriu - (22:30): The old rights UI  \nsdumitriu - (22:30): They could be removed  \nabusenius - (22:31): all of the Panels/\\*Rights\\*.xml ?  \nsdumitriu - (22:31): Yes  \nabusenius - (22:32): ok  \nabusenius - (22:40): hm, Panels/RightsEditorWelcome and Panels/RightsTips are actually used in toucan and albatros  \nabusenius - (22:41): they display some help with editor=rights  \nsdumitriu - (22:42): Yes, I know  \nsdumitriu - (22:42): I was thinking what could be done with that  \nabusenius - (22:42): in principle the help is not specific to the old ui  \nsdumitriu - (22:42): The problem is that those skins need the panels on the right, since they have the editor switcher in there  \nabusenius - (22:43): only RightsEditorWelcome displays some form with the old ui  \nabusenius - (22:44): with the new ui only the \"welcome\" text is shown  \nabusenius - (22:44): (and GlobalRightsEditorWelcome)  \nabusenius - (22:45): I guess the best is to leave them there, just remove the old rights ui-specific code  \nabusenius - (22:45): those panels can safely be merged into one tough  \nabusenius - (22:47): in any case removing the panels would break old skins  \nlpereira left at 23:01 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvdrean left at 23:33 (Quit: Leaving.  \nfm left at 23:51 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \nrrodriguez left at 23:53 (Quit: rrodriguez  \n\n"}
