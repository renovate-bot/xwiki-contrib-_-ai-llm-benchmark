I don't recall exactly but I think that's because it would have required to add non bug fixes things to the 2.2 bra,ch  \nvmassol - (11:51): for ex I remember that the new script service is not in the 2..2 branch  \nvmassol - (11:51): and that's why I was not able to merge some bug fixes on 2.2  \nvmassol - (11:51): basically on 2.2 we're not supporting special chars  \nvmassol - (11:51): same as before  \nDenis - (11:53): vmassol: ok, the issue is that it does it partially, and you are able to create documents that you can never reach  \nvmassol - (12:01): Denis: yes I know but I don't see any easy solution  \nvmassol - (12:02): and note that the 2.2 branch is close to being closed  \nvmassol - (12:02): so we shouldn't introduce anything dangerous on it at this stage  \nvmassol - (12:02): and backporting lots of issue is too risky  \nDenis - (12:03): agreed, what confuse me is that 2.2 branch has fixes related to special chars  \nDenis - (12:04): the latest is XWIKI-5075  \nDenis - (12:04): vmassol: these seems to me useless since they are unsupported in URLs  \nvmassol - (12:05): Denis: I agree  \nvmassol - (12:05): but it's probbaly hard to remove them  \nDenis - (12:05): sure, but this could cause confusion, I suggest we add a big warning in the release note.  \nflorinciu left at 12:08 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nlucaa - (12:09): hi guys.
