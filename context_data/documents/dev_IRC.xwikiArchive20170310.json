Do you mean an extension of renderer ?  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0you can find the current XHTML renderer on https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/tree/master/xwiki-rendering-syntaxes/xwiki-rendering-syntax-xhtml  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0but we are using the HTML5 one now  \n15:14\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/tree/master/xwiki-rendering-syntaxes/xwiki-rendering-syntax-html5  \n15:16\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0tmortagne1, Actually I was going through the proposed project for Gsoc17 \"Translation in Context\", and there it is written \u00a0by using XHTML Renderer.  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the goal is not to write a XHTML renderer but to use the annotated XHTML renderer to find translation macros in the html content  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0that would be the annotated html5 renderer now  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0let me update the proposal  \n15:19\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0it's an old proposal we keep copy from one gsoc to another :)  \n15:20\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0Yes, it is updated now.  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0you don't really need to look at the source of the annotated html renderer I think, this project is about navigate in the dom using javascript to find translation macros by matching special html comments  \n15:22\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0you can add ?outputSyntax=annotatedhtml to the URL for the page to be rendered with the annotated html renderer  \n15:23\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the when you look at the source in your browser you will find stuff like <!--startmacro:velocity|-||-|  \n15:23\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0that what indicate the beginning of a macro, its name, its parameters and its content  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the WYSIWYG use those annotation to find macros too  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0the WYSIWYG use those annotations to find macros too  \n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0maybe there is some code that could be reused to find macros, mflorea1 ?  \n15:40\u00a0<prakhar123>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:41\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n15:49\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0oh, I see. I was going in a wrong direction I guess.  \n15:53\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0So if I put ?outputSyntax=annotatedhtml to the URL of any webpage then it will be rendered with annodated html-renderer.  \n15:53\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0sgc072: yes  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0then you can start play with javascript to find translation macros  \n15:58\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0tmortagne1, Thanks again. I will try and do a little more research about this concept and the project ofcourse. :P  \n15:59\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0sgc072: great :)  \n16:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n16:42\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n16:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<prakhar123>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:27\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:22\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n19:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:56\u00a0<prakhar123>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:12\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:25\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:33\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n20:36\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<pulkit4tech>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:50\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n21:09\u00a0<sgc072>\u00a0has quit  \n21:31\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:33\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<prakhar123>\u00a0has quit  \n22:52\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:45\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
