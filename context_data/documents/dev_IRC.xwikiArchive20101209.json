I am fixing the apps pages.  \noanat - (12:32): silviar: ok  \nsilviar - (12:32): thx  \nvmassol - (12:35): jvdrean: where is the watchlist configured to decide what wikis to include in the mail?  \nvenkatna left at 12:35 (Remote host closed the connection  \nvmassol - (12:36): jvdrean: I'm also wondering why there was \"XWiki.org\" as the wiki name in this morning's watchlist email. Have you seen it?  \njvdrean - (12:36): vmassol: the watchlist now takes wiki pretty names into account  \nvmassol - (12:37): jvdrean: from the descriptor?  \njvdrean - (12:37): the wikis to include are configured in http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiNotifications  \njvdrean - (12:37): yes  \nvmassol - (12:37): k  \nvmassol - (12:38): jvdrean: r u doing it? or should I force your lock?  \nvmassol - (12:39): thanks fmancinelli  \nvmassol - (12:39): :)  \nfmancinelli - (12:39): ;)  \nvmassol - (12:41): jvdrean: done in the end  \njvdrean - (12:41): vmassol: doing it, any wiki to add in addition to extensions ?  \nvmassol - (12:41): jvdrean: also why is there a notif for playground in this morning's watchlist mail?  \njvdrean - (12:41): ok  \njvdrean - (12:41): can't tell about playground, is it new ?  \nvmassol - (12:41): it's not in the list  \nvmassol - (12:42): the list of wikis for which to get notifs  \nfmancinelli - (12:52): vmassol: Do you know why a lot of symbols are displayed with their unicode code (e.g., &#8712;) instead of the symbol? On incubator (and on my local wiki) this didn't happen  \nvmassol - (12:52): fmancinelli: you have them in your content it seems  \nvmassol - (12:53): I see for ex:  \nvmassol - (12:53): A //social network// is a directed graph //SN = (U, L)// where //U// is a set of users and //L &#8838; U \u00d7 U// is a binary relation that defines the links between users.  \nvmassol - (12:53): (in wiki edit mode)  \nfmancinelli - (12:54): strange, I have copypasted... Ok I'll look at it (thanks)  \nfmancinelli - (12:55): well actually I copy paste the content with the symbols, but after the save it seems that all these symbols are replaced with their unicode codes  \nfmancinelli - (12:57): lunch  \nvmassol - (12:58): fmancinelli: in wiki editor?  \nvmassol - (12:58): you copy pasted text or html?  \nvmassol - (12:59): the wiki editor doesn't do any conversion  \nvmassol - (12:59): (normally)  \nsburjan - (13:14): vmassol: Obsolete extensions are still to be moved ?  \nvmassol - (13:14): yes  \nsilviar - (13:21): vmassol: don't we want to display the release notes ( when they are available) for the latest version of an extension? I believe now we can only see them if we edit the objects  \nvmassol - (13:21): silviar: yes we do  \nvmassol - (13:22): we need someone to work on the UI for that  \nsilviar - (13:22): ok  \nvmassol - (13:22): I asked evalica if she could have a look but she's busy I think  \nevalica - (13:23): vmassol: I need to work on the extension manager - sorry  \nabusenius joined #xwiki at 13:23  \nvmassol - (13:24): evalica: I know, don't forget this one when you get time (if nobody does it before)  \nevalica - (13:25): actually silviar I don't know what you are talking about - what release notes?  \nevalica - (13:25): aha .. ExtensionCode.ExtensionVersionClass maybe  \nevalica - (13:27): and why do we need an UI for this? this should be added to the code.. after the table of content ... with a h1 that says: \"Release notes\", no?  \nvmassol - (13:29): evalica: I don't feel that after the TOC is a good place  \nvmassol - (13:29): it should be related to downloads  \nvmassol - (13:29): it would take too much place otherwise  \nvmassol - (13:29): what I think I'd like is  \nvmassol - (13:29): when you click on the download button  \nvmassol - (13:29): you can have differents action  \nvmassol - (13:29): 1) download latest version  \nvmassol - (13:29): 2) see release notes for latest version  \nvmassol - (13:30): 3) download and see release notes for past versions  \nvmassol - (13:30): wdyt?  \nevalica - (13:30): IMO release notes are different that download .. and they should be visible \u00a0even without clicking the download button  \nevalica - (13:30): I may need first to see the release notes in order to decide if I want to download the version  \nevalica - (13:31): plus it may not be very intuitive that if I press Download .. I will see release notes  \nevalica - (13:31): your described behavior will work for download latest | old versions ... but release notes .. should be visible also somewhere else ... and maybe be independent ...  \nevalica - (13:32): download is an action while readin release notes ... is more of an informative step  \nevalica - (13:32): like the description of the extension ... just IMO  \nvmassol - (13:37): evalica: ok then I'm fine to have release notes at the bottom of the page  \nvmassol - (13:37): but we need some layout to display the older ones  \nvmassol - (13:37): FTM I'm going to add the latest release notes at the bottom  \nvmassol - (13:37): if not empty  \nvmassol - (13:37): doing it now  \nevalica - (13:39): vmassol: don't forget to specify the version, latest is very shallow, put something like Latest Version (x.x)  \nsabageru left at 13:39 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nfmancinelli - (13:40): vmassol: back... yes in the wiki editor. I pasted things like \"u ? U\" and I get \"u &#8712 U\" after the save  \nvmassol - (13:41): hmm xwiki.org is on iso and not utf8  \nvmassol - (13:41): (fmancinelli)  \nvmassol - (13:41): that's probabky why  \nvmassol - (13:44): silviar: any example of an extension with release notes?  \nsburjan - (13:45): vmassol: Swizzle plugins is considered obsolete ?  \nabusenius left at 13:46 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nvmassol - (13:46): sburjan: plugins are obsolete  \nsburjan - (13:47): so I should mark all plugins with the obsolete flag ?  \nsdumitriu - (13:47): fmancinelli, vmassol: Yes, xwiki.org is still on ISO-8859-1, although I complained about it several times  \nvmassol - (13:47): yes  \nsilviar - (13:47): vmassol: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Check+Config+And+Indexes+Application  \nsdumitriu - (13:47): fmancinelli: there's no easy fix for it, sorry  \nsburjan - (13:47): vmassol: Mail Sender Plugin too ? That is a pretty critical component  \nvmassol - (13:47): silviar: thanks  \nsilviar - (13:47): you're welcome  \nvmassol - (13:47): sburjan: yes that one too is obsolete  \nsburjan - (13:47): okay  \nsdumitriu - (13:48): fmancinelli: You can put {{html}}&#...;{{/html}} to fix it for each character  \nfmancinelli - (13:48): sdumitriu: ok, thanks  \nvmassol - (13:49): silviar: how is this: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Check+Config+And+Indexes+Application#HReleaseNotes ?  \nvmassol - (13:50): ATM it's only the latest RN that are displayed, I'll improve it  \nsilviar - (13:50): vmassol: Looks good! I like them more in page too.  \nvmassol - (13:52): silviar: yeah me too in \u00a0the end ;)  \nfmancinelli - (13:53): sdumitriu, vmassol: fixed. thanks  \nsburjan - (13:53): vmassol: so I should take the whole list of plugins and mark them as Obsolete ?  \nsburjan - (13:54): because most ofthem aren't marked as obsolete  \nevalica left at 13:55 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (13:59): sburjan: hmmm  \nvmassol - (13:59): I was going to say yes  \nvmassol - (13:59): what does obsolete means for a user?  \nvmassol - (14:00): does it mean that there's a newer version available?  \nvmassol - (14:00): what we need is to say:  \nvmassol - (14:00): it's using an obsolete technology  \nvmassol - (14:00): and needs to be rewrtitten in the new arctecture  \nkwoot - (14:01): okay, this one is a bit harder I guess. I now have a velocity macro that generates a list of links to non existent pages and the links include references to templates.  \nkwoot - (14:02): It works like a charm, really cool stuff.  \nkwoot - (14:02): NOw the next challenge is:  \nkwoot - (14:02): wthin this list of documents are documents that are written more than once. Like a progress report.  \nkwoot - (14:03): So within the list I want a sublist of already writte progress reports (based on a template) and the last entry on this list is something like \"new report\" te make a new report.  \nkwoot - (14:03): Now, how can I build that in xwiki? I know it is not an easy queston.  \nsburjan - (14:05): vmassol: yes, from a user POV obsolete would mean it's not longer supported, something like legacy. But by saying obsolete implies somehow that we don't use it anymore. But we still have plugins on which we rely hardly.  \nsburjan - (14:06): so we have to find a term/flag to say this the way we want in the moste xplicit way  \nvmassol - (14:07): sburjan: ok I'll use the tooltip macro to add explanation as to what obsolete means  \nsburjan - (14:08): vmassol: IMO we should (me) start marking plugins as obsolete after we finish the migration and after we find the proper way to say it.  \nvmassol - (14:13): sburjan: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Unique+Identification+Number+Plugin  \nsburjan - (14:14): vmassol: tehre is also an error under the macro : Unknown macro: tooltip  \nvmassol - (14:14): and http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/SVG+Macro+(Radeox)  \nvmassol - (14:15): sburjan: ah chjecking visibility  \nvmassol - (14:15): indeed it was current wiki  \nvmassol - (14:15): try again  \nsburjan - (14:16): vmassol: UIN Number Tooltip looks OK, but it's hard to spot IMO :(  \nsburjan - (14:16): but the idea is great  \nvmassol - (14:17): there's a question mark icon  \nvmassol - (14:17): I'll leave it like this for now  \nsburjan - (14:17): okay.  \nvmassol - (14:17): I've also documented it here: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/  \nsburjan - (14:18): after we finish migrating the plugins, I'll get through the whole list and add the tooltip  \nvmassol - (14:18): what?  \nvmassol - (14:18): sburjan: but I did this....  \nvmassol - (14:18): I don't understand  \nvmassol - (14:19): jvelociter: thanks for your tooltip macro ;)  \nvmassol - (14:21): sburjan: make sure you move installation instrcutions to their right place  \nvmassol - (14:22): sburjan: fixing http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Pre+Macro  \njvelociter - (14:22): vmassol: are you using it ?  \nsburjan - (14:23): vmassol: re about plugins migration. I was refering that we still have Plugins that are in ImportedExtension. IMO we should finish with those, and the to mark Plugins as obsolete.. one by one  \njvelociter - (14:23): strange IRC bot says I modified Extension.Large Wiki Export but that wasn't me  \njvelociter - (14:23): bug on adding a tag ?  \nvmassol - (14:23): jvelociter: yes  \nvmassol - (14:23): in the notif at least  \nvmassol - (14:24): sburjan: you said you were going to add tooltips. I don't understand what you mean  \nvmassol - (14:24): jvelociter: see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Acronym+To+Link+Plugin for ex  \nvmassol - (14:24): (for the tooltip macro)  \nsburjan - (14:24): yes.. add tooltips after ALL plugins are in Extension space  \nvmassol - (14:24): sburjan: where and why?  \nsabageru joined #xwiki at 14:24  \nvmassol - (14:25): I do'nt get it  \nvmassol - (14:25): can you detail what you mean  \nsburjan - (14:26): ok. so. We are moving the pages from ImportedExtension to Extension Space. I was proposing that we finish with moving pages from ImportedExtension to Extension, and AFTER to add the tooltips for plugins (toolip that they are obsolete)  \nvmassol - (14:26): what tooltips?  \nvmassol - (14:26): why would we need any more?  \nvmassol - (14:27): are you talking about tags and not tooltips?  \nsburjan - (14:27): well we have one that we include in all the plugin pages, right ?  \nvmassol - (14:27): yes it's already there  \nsburjan - (14:28): I know, but not all the plugin pages have it (not yet)  \nvmassol - (14:28): they all have it  \nvmassol - (14:28): give me one that hasn't  \njstoldt - (14:29): good bye :)  \njstoldt - (14:29): see you tomorrow  \njstoldt left at 14:29 (Quit: Page closed  \nsburjan - (14:30): lol. yes, you added them now :)) I thought I had to be added manually on each page  \nsburjan - (14:30): silly me :))  \nvmassol - (14:30): now was 15 minutes ago  \nvmassol - (14:30): but yes  \nvmassol - (14:30): :)  \nsdumitriu - (14:31): jvelociter: Hm, I have an idea about the failing livetable  \njvelociter - (14:32): http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/TopContributors  \njvelociter - (14:32): (vmassol )  \nsburjan - (14:32): there are some plugins left that totally lack any form of documentation.

The problem lies in the fact that for a document the AS tries to retrieve a previous version (due to an update event in the past). the document does not exist, therefore the exception is thrown and logged. the verification for the existance of the version is made through the help of getDocument (doc, version).
