 \n17:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0This means that if the admin changes the custom display of the email field, that change is going to be reverted at the next server restart  \n17:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then we should not use that...  \n17:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if the user can break it anytime and if we can never fix/improve  \n17:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The only case we want to fix is using our own custom display code set in the wrong syntax  \n17:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0for now  \n17:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So we should check !isCustomDisplayed || isCustomDisplayed && content is the one we set for syntax 2.0 && syntax is 1.0  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hoping that we don't change it in the future....  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that looks like a big pile of hacks  \n17:41\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yep  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now that custom displayer is really a bad hack  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we should just remove tht  \n17:42\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, we should have an email field  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would that be complex to do for 4.1.3?  \n17:42\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes...  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we keep the hack for 4.1.3 and someone (should be Enygma` IMO since he introduced it) fixes it for 4.2  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n17:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Now, as I see it, that displayer was introduced in 4.0  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case Enygma` needs to fix the code for 4.1.3 since right now it's not going to work  \n17:44\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So this affects users that upgraded from an old version (with the XWikiUsers class in syntax 1.0), to 4.0 or 4.1, and then to 4.1.3+  \n17:45\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Is that a really big marketshare to require such an ugly hack?  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's 100% marketshare  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no wait  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn\"t understand  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my use case on myxwiki.org  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was in 3.5  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and moved to 4.1.3SNAP  \n17:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, it affects myxwiki.org because you tried 4.1.2+ before  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we do have people who moved to 4.0 for sure  \n17:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But I think only some of the wikis, not all of them  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know the marketshare  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you say we should instead offer a script?  \n17:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The precondition is that XWikiUsers was in the 1.0 syntax  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note to self: next time I'll really veto a hack like this....  \n17:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I wonder when did that change...  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I saw it and didn't agree but I let it go through)  \n17:48\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0XWikiUsers is created if it does not exist and it is created with the default syntax  \n17:48\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so I am assuming that XWikiUsers started to be 2.0 when we moved to 2.0 as the default syntax  \n17:49\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only for new installs Enygma`  \n17:49\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I though about the fact that the fix I did won`t help much for the problem you were having Vincent, but after I did it  \n17:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0why don't we simply force the syntax we want in the class ?  \n17:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see the point in having a different displayer depending on the syntaxe  \n17:50\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes, IMO the getUsersClass() method, additionally to all the other properties, should check the class document`s syntax and force it to the new default one  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that looks much easier to do  \n17:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0especially since it's impossible to make sure your displayer will work for whatever is the class syntax  \n17:51\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but again, if \\*some\\* users might have a custom displayer in 1.0 syntax, it will break... though I don`t know how relevant this scenario is  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: you could revert your change of this morning and instead set the XWikiUsers page to 2.0  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or 2.1)  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so now we have to pay for the hack of the customer displayer!  \n17:52\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so the idea is that, even if a user will try to set the syntax to one different than the default one, he will not be allowed by the platform  \n17:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0at worst you can always execute a converted if really needed  \n17:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0would not be needed if we did not had a custom displayer which we should never have that way  \n17:53\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0how else do you propose we handle custom displayers?  \n17:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you need another property type, add it  \n17:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if an existing display is not good enough improve it  \n17:54\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0the problem is more generic than adding new properties  \n17:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't seed any reason for use to add custom displayer, custom displayer should be for exatensions  \n17:54\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0regular users will not be able to do this  \n17:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I'm talking about us here and in that case a very standard class  \n17:55\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I though we were talking about a clean, general solution...  \n17:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne: There's also the timezone that has a custom displayer  \n17:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure and it's wrong too  \n17:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So even if we add an email field type, we'll still have the timezone to take care of  \n17:56\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'd rather not add a timezone field type as well...  \n17:56\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I think we will need an overhaul of field types at some point  \n17:56\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0and existing field options  \n17:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: why not, it's a pretty standard concept  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+1 for a timezone field type  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and a lot more  \n17:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I think timezone makes sense  \n17:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0like would a GPS coordinate  \n17:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0etc.  \n17:57\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0what about a pink email with stars at the end field type?  \n17:57\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I doubt we can add that in platform :)  \n17:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0GPS would allow nice distance searches with Lucene :)  \n17:57\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0yep  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: we don't need that in the platform AFAICS  \n17:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: do we have the need in platform ?  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but email and timezone, we do  \n17:58\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but how can our users achieve it?  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with a custom displayer  \n17:58\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0sdumitriu: I've been wanting to play with that for a while  \n17:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I was going to say that Timezone is usually going to be bound to a datetime, but then I remembered that SQL doesn't have a bulletproof way of storing timezones in their date fields  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: it's us that shouldn't use custom displayer  \n17:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0custom displayer is last resort and should not be the first idea that come to mind when adding something in platform  \n17:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but users can use that  \n17:59\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I see  \n18:00\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:00\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0also something simple that we need often is the ability to add CSS classnames when calling #display  \n18:00\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0this is often heartbreaking to have to construct the input manually in edit mode because we need the class name  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok here's what i propose Enygma`  \n18:01\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0and of course the html5 goodnesses  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) force the syntax for XWikiusers class in java  \n18:01\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0input type=\"email\"  \n18:01\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0input type=\"number\"  \n18:01\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0etc  \n18:02\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0but for that we need to move to html5 first which is not trivial  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) Add to the RN that if someone has written some xwiki sytax 1.0 field they'll need to put it back (they still have it in the history)  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this will handle 99% of users  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and for 1% they'll need to read the RN and those are advanced users  \n18:03\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0wdym in 2) by \"they'll need to put it back\"? you said to just change the syntax, not to delete any existing custom displayers  \n18:04\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0they will still be there, only that they will not be rendered  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0htey'll need to rewrite it in 2.0 syntax  \n18:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems acceptable to me Enygma`  \n18:08\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: ok  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have to go too in a few minutes, could you handle this so that tomorrow I can upgrade to 4.1.3-SNAPSHOT on myxwiki.org and have it work?  \n18:09\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yep  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:09\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0;)  \n18:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Do you think we need to make the registration warning even bigger?
