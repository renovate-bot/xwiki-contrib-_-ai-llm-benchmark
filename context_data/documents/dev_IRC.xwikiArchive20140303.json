You need to put it manually  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's true for ALL panels  \n11:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0that's because is not a panel. All panels are correctly displayed  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no exception  \n11:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0Navigation Menu is not a panel.

It is not trye  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is related to the menu feature, nothing to do with panels and UIX  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again nothing to do with UIX and panes  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*panels  \n11:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ok I will remove the warning  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can put this warning in the menu application if you wish  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not in UIX  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Menu app documentation that is)  \n11:53\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0for the Menu app, it is already documented  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually the screenshots are a bit misleading for left/right panels uix  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the screenshots show a single panel being surrounded by a red border  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's actually the full zone that should be surrounded  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not just a single panel  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so a screenshot with 2 panels would be a bit less misleading IMO  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and the red border showing that it's around the whole thing)  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the UIX is for the whole area  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also \"This Extension Point is contributed as a template (rightpanels.vm) in version \u00a04.3-milestone-1 of XWiki.\" I think I would phrase it differently: \"This extension point is used in a panel (rightpanels.vm) and was introduced in XWiki 4.3\"  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the doc should also mention that the extension point uses the configuration params for listing left and right panels  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to decide what panels to display  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"leftPanels\" and \"rightPanels\" defined in the xclass inside XWiki.XWikiPrefrrences  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and configurable through the admin )  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry for all the comments and thanks for taking up the documentation of this! :)  \n11:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: the This Extension Point is contributed as a template (rightpanels.vm) in version \u00a04.3-milestone-1 of XWiki. is generated by the UIX app  \n11:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I took the example from the other entries  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdym?  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the prhasing looks wrong  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or at least misleading  \n11:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0'Introduced in version' and 'Extension contributing this Extension Point' fields  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me contribute = implementation of an UIX  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you contribute an impl of a UIX  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but a UIX is used in a certain place  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to standardize our vocabulary on this, I think we're doing poor ATM  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm open to suggestions but we need to make it clear  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- who is defining the UIX, i.e. where it's used  \n12:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the model was this http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ExtensionPoint/AfterHeaderUIX  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually where it's used depends on the skin  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we may not want to document that  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- what we call those implementing the UIX  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@evalica: which proves that what I wrote wasn't good :) At least I don't understand it in the same way now  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need a common vocabulary  \n13:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n13:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:59\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:16\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0has quit  \n15:21\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:25\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:53\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<rk\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:04\u00a0<rk\\_>\u00a0re  \n16:09\u00a0<rk\\_>\u00a0Hi everyone!

 \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0spu7inc: you can import them through a REST API yes  \n17:38\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0by script? or is there already a maven plugin / intellij plugin which does the job?  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki43M2#HRESTAPIImprovements  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no intellij plugin yet, that would be awesome to have!  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone who knows who to write an intelli plugin could do that very easily  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the xwiki part is really simple  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just a POST to the right URL and you're done  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually just a POST to http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI#HPageresources is enough, no need to import a XAT  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*XAR  \n17:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/POST/PUT  \n17:41\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0Thx alot >)  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what exists is XEclipse which does this but based on Eclipse RCP  \n17:42\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0I am not really into eclipse ;)  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it can be used standalone  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(no need to have eclipse)  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however it's not been maintained for a while but I know Ludovic improved it not long ago but he's not released his changes unfortunately  \n17:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(can't seem on http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XWiki+Eclipse+Downloads )  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but it can be built from sources easily though, https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/xwiki-eclipse )  \n17:44\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0Hmm, which project do I have to clone, when I want to start adding functionality to xwiki? platform or enterprise?  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends what you're changing  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there' s information here:  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SourceRepository  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(maybe not enough for you though)  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tell us more what you wish to do!  \n17:46\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0I am in the unfortunate situation, that I have to take over a project from one of my former co-workers  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks mflorea for https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/4c2da3bf843b87574d89da5fc7d1dc81ef94fe4f#commitcomment-5545358  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking now  \n17:46\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0And he did not really do a nice job  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0spu7inc: interesting challenge indeed :)  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what has he done on the xwiki side?  \n17:47\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0He \"bypassed\" the xwiki way to store data by utilizing a sql plugin  \n17:47\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0instead of custom mapping  \n17:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed, that's not very nice  \n17:48\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0He did all his dev-work inside the browser editor and left quite a mess ^^  \n17:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean he didn't save his work under a SCM?  \n17:49\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0Indeed >)  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0naughty\u2026 :)  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FYI in case you don't know, we have 2 extensions to sync with a SCM  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one for subversion and one for git  \n17:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that makes it easy to push/pull changes  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for git: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/GitHubApp )  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(github actually, not git)  \n17:50\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0So you can basically edit your stuff and it will be automatically pushed into your instance?  \n17:50\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0Lovely :)  \n17:52\u00a0<spu7inc>\u00a0So, if you want to get all the modules required for code completion within Velocity files, does this mean I should clone platform, or enterprise?
