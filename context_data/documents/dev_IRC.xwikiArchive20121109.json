It should include decent search capabilites, good support for backup, clean upgrade paths and support exporting data to other formats so you don't fear being \"locked in\"  \n09:55\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I thought the Word addin was a very neat idea -  \n09:56\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Letting people write in Word and publish on the wiki  \n09:56\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0But I'm not sure how well that one works, since you get a lot of \"noise\" in your wiki page source when doing that (not to mention that I had to hack my hosts file to get the addin installed, since the files are not correctly placed any longer...)  \n09:58\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0And with todays world, having a mobile/tablet friendly skin is definitely not \"too much\"  \n09:59\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0Xwiki delivers on almost everything I was looking for  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Inge-: indeed mobile is probably going to be one of domain we're going to work on in 5.x (we still haven't the brainstorming about 5.x but that's my guess)  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I also liked the word addin but the main developer has left the project  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we're in need of a contributor to continue it  \n10:22\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I've thought about it :P  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be neat  \n10:23\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: I haven't checked other classes but I saw a missing @since in SolrQueryExecutor (I have added it)  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I've now checked and all classes are missing @since in solr-api  \n10:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: yes, I realized that yesterday as well :) Looking at the code style tips, it is not clear if the @since tag should be used only in interfaces or everywhere.  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well interfaces are really mandatory  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and for me everywhere is best, makes it easy to see when a class was introduced  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's mandatory is all public APIs  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0interfaces or classes  \n10:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but there is no public API now :P  \n10:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0just internal API :)  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now for me it's best to have it everywhere since it makes it easy to know  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when something was inroduced  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise it's hard  \n10:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but I agree  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have to look at reelase dates  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and history  \n10:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: also, should we limit the use of @since to classes or should we do it for each method individually as well?  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0classes=classes/interfaces  \n10:43\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0actually, I assume you start with @since on the class/interface and, as you add new methods in future versions, you tag only those new methods with the corresponding @since tag for the version they were introduced, while the initial methods are not tagged (meaning that they were introduced with the initial class/interface)  \n10:54\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Hello.

 \n19:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but it also has empty translation pages  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I see  \n19:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I want to know what to do with the empty ones  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd say no  \n19:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it shouldn't make any difference in practice I thin  \n19:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but they will always show up on next releases  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0think  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n19:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe it doesn't matter  \n19:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0actually, if I add them, the page will show up as having a translation (inside an xwiki instance)  \n19:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but it won't be used  \n19:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but then again, it's a translation page (technical)  \n19:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right  \n19:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the translation key is not found in the translated page  \n19:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it's going to not do anything  \n19:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0wonder why l10n even bothers to give me this empty page  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah I don't know about that  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's strange  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe that's what needs to be fixed  \n19:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right  \n19:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, so I`m not committing empty pages  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0makes more sense to me  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise you'd need to commit all languages  \n20:06\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n20:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: any idea why I get http://pastebin.com/J71qE1ju ?
