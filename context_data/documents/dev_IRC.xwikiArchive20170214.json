(page or vm ?)  \n18:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0@ol-ow2 if you look at http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/WikiMacros it contains wiki macros. if it's in that list, it's in the page, otherwise in java. there are also vm macros. Not sure which macros you are talking about.  \n18:46\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0thanks evalica  \n18:47\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i made a mistake, indeed i'm looking for attachementSelector velocity macro  \n18:47\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0(xwiki 6.4.4)  \n18:52\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0hum.. bundle since v3.0  \n18:52\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0i get an unknow macro error  \n19:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:05\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0Ok we found the issue and fixed it, this one is beautiful, we has doc.getObject(\"blah\", $mathtool.toNumber($request.number)) \u00a0and it was not working  \n19:06\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0changed it to $mathtool.toInteger($request.number) and bam\u000f it works  \n19:07\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0looks like what happened was getObject(String, Double) was matching better to a newly added (?) function getObject(String, boolean) than getObject(String, int) which was intended  \n19:07\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0so basically adding a function can break things  \n19:07\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: looks like you forgot to set the locales in http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/Data/XWiki/9.0/#HTranslations  \n19:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:00\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:26\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0hi, does xwiki9 support Visio webdrawings (web parts) ?
