I guess a template page would be the best  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's easy to do)  \n13:32\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0okay, great  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's the easiest to implement and the most flexible  \n13:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(easier than b) I think)  \n13:33\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yup, and just wondering if it should have separate input for email address or if it should take the user email (the second is easier and more \"user-friendly\" i guess)  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I think an input for the \"to\", prefilled with the user's mail address would be the best probably (a bit more work for you though ;))  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some user's haven't set their mail address in their profile for example  \n13:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*users  \n13:35\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0okay then :)  \n13:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: Denis has loaded the last snapshot from master and got http://hastebin.com/tenotuvase  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is this fixed now?  \n13:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0here is what I launch: xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-7.1-20150413.112758-85.zip  \n13:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at com.xpn.xwiki.XWiki.getDocument(XWiki.java:1494)  \n13:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I see getStore() at this line  \n13:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it should not be related to my changes  \n13:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or at least it this build is not up to date  \n13:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that line was still getStore() 5 days ago it seems  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so not idea how you can end up with a XWiki instance not having a store  \n13:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/not/no/  \n13:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: don't you have something else before that ? looks more like a consequence to me  \n13:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0nothing  \n13:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha wait  \n13:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually looks like a cross dependency  \n13:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looking a the chain of components dependencies  \n13:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0putting some lazy loading here and thre  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: just rebuilt xwiki-enterprise and got https://gist.github.com/vmassol/9d2e86ce2a9cb231baa6  \n13:57\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems caused by the quartz upgrade  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that I have built only xwiki-enterprise assuming maven.xwiki.org would provide the correct built jars  \n14:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0In the meantime, I just tried 7.0.1 snapshot, and while creating a subwiki, it stays never ending on \"Checking Hibernate mapping and updating schema if needed for wiki [\u2026]\"  \n14:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but the wiki get created, so a UI issue  \n14:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0di you try to clean your browser cache ?  \n14:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n14:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0first time I see that wiki creation screen, so no I have not  \n14:27\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hello, to PR this issue, http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6118 and avoid a newer $columnsProperties value, I need to know if a method like \u00a0$class.get($MyProperty).getTypeProperty() exist.  \n14:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0I want to test if MyProperty is an Boolean type.  \n14:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0If not it doesn't matter. I will fix the issue but it won't be nice. :-)  \n14:30\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n14:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:15\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has quit  \n15:20\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:23\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:23\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:28\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:30\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:35\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:59\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: scheduler error should be fixed  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks tmortagne  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw and FYI I've discussed with Dan Allen from asciidoc and he's started a group to implement a real grammar for asciidoc and thus to provide an AST for us. He's also interested in having a full java impl for the parsing (he's talking with some wikitext guys about this which seem to have started such an implementation)  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(he was there at Devoxx FR)  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok cool  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no ETA though...  \n16:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hope wikitext implementation won't be too eclipse oriented  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Actually I think it could be interesting to start a dicussion with Eclipse Mylyn guys for merging wikitext and xwiki rendering. It would make sense if we were ok to donate xwiki rendering to the eclipse foundation  \n16:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not sure we could do much with that, would need to rewrite everything with wikitext APIs  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the goal would be to propose a new project outside of mylyn that would group wikitext and xwiki rendering  \n17:11\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:12\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n17:21\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n17:31\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:05\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:06\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:24\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:26\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n22:54\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n23:10\u00a0<martin-h>\u00a0has quit  \n23:28\u00a0<martin-h>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:33\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has quit  \n23:39\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit\n"}
