It's meant to let you practice editing.  \nneruda - (01:13): yes im logged in  \nsdumitriu - (01:14): Well then you can edit anything  \nneruda - (01:14): i thought that meant that other sections would not persist changes  \nneruda - (01:14): ok  \nneruda - (01:14): understood  \nsburjan` - (01:14): everything persists  \nsburjan` - (01:14): :)  \nneruda - (01:14): good  \nsburjan` - (01:14): hello sdumitriu :)  \nsdumitriu - (01:14): No, it means that you can do whatever you want in the sandbox space, it's not supposed to hold valuable information, it's there just for practice  \nsdumitriu - (01:15): Hi sburjan`  \nneruda - (01:15): sdumitriu: ok i misinterpreted  \nneruda - (01:16): one other thing: in vista the start\\_xwiki shortcut placed on the desktop after installation does not work  \nlpereira left at 01:16 (Quit: Leaving.  \nneruda - (01:16): even when set to run as admin the window closes automatically when it should stay open  \nsburjan` - (01:17): hmmm  \nneruda - (01:17): stop\\_xwiki works fine thought  \nneruda - (01:17): though  \nsburjan` - (01:17): try orunning start\\_xwiki within a command prompt  \nsburjan` - (01:17): \\*running  \nsburjan` - (01:17): and tell us what's the error message you get there  \nneruda - (01:17): sburjan`: that does work, thats what im doing now  \nneruda - (01:18): the problem is vista automatically closes the window on batch files when the process needs it to stay open  \nneruda - (01:18): ive been fighting with it for a while, but i gave up and now just execute start\\_xwiki from the cmdline  \nsburjan` - (01:18): that's odd  \nsburjan` - (01:19): that's odd.
