(like \"invalid credentials\") ?  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0martinus\\_\\_: depends what you mean by customize, if you are talking about a custom authenticator providing a different message test, not right now but what is diplayed is a translation string associated to key \"invalidcredentials\" so you could change the translation text  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/test/text/  \n10:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to change a translation the simplest is usually to do http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Localization+Module#HRegisterawikitranslation  \n10:57\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, I'm talking of the regular ldap authenticator  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ldap authenticator does not control the message either, invalid credentials is just what is displayed when the authentication failed for any reason basically  \n10:59\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, that's what I guess'd ;)  \n10:59\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0tmortagne, thanks !  \n11:50\u00a0<brom>\u00a0has quit  \n12:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: I don't know why 8.4-rc-1, that I have just created, is not listed there: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/  \n12:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0(hi :))  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: how have you created it?
