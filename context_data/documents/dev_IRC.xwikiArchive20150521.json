In the future consider removing a Listener first if you really want to register it again. \" may be it is the problem...  \n16:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Pbas: sure a jira issue would be nice, if it also detail a way to reproduce it with jetty/hsqldb standard distribution even nicer :)  \n16:51\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:53\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0Hi all. We are migrating the jira.xwiki.org server. This will cause a downtime for at least 1h, depending on how the migration goes.  \n16:59\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:21\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:33\u00a0<silverdrop>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:59\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:35\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0is now known as <Fee\\_Neant>  \n18:35\u00a0<Fee\\_Neant>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0The JIRA is up again and should be functional.

I am getting 404 errors on different pages stating that require.min.js is not found  \n22:18\u00a0<Harrison\\_\\_>\u00a0Looking closer, it shows the generated URL is //webjars/requirejs/2.1.15/require.min.js  \n22:19\u00a0<Harrison\\_\\_>\u00a0I was looking around and found out that that URL is being generated by $services.webjars.url('requirejs', \"require$jsExtension\")  \n22:19\u00a0<Harrison\\_\\_>\u00a0However, I'm not sure how to fix the URL so that it loads a resource that actually exists  \n22:20\u00a0<Harrison\\_\\_>\u00a0I tried setting xwiki.home to the correct hostname, and I also set xwiki.webapppath=, because I am running xwiki as ROOT in my tomcat instance  \n22:20\u00a0<Harrison\\_\\_>\u00a0However no matter what I change in xwiki.cfg, it doesn't appear to make a difference to the URL  \n22:20\u00a0<Harrison\\_\\_>\u00a0Does anyone have any guidance on this problem?  \n23:09\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:11\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:38\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit\n"}
