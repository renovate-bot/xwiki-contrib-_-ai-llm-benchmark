Macros are a core feature. I don't know if we can have a separate resource file for macros. Anyway, since the translation is done on the server side, the resource fine should be in the core IMO.  \nlucaa - (14:37): guys I have a components question:  \nlucaa - (14:37): I have A component role, B extends A and is component role as well, A1 implements A, is component and has hint x, B1 implements B is component and has hint x. Can it be any problem when I'll lookup role A with hint x? Can I be sure to get A1 and not B1, or I'd better change B1's hint?  \ntmortagne - (14:37): mflorea: as it's written in XWiki-4752 \"This is when waiting for macros to have their own translation resources \u00a0(need new localization component).\"  \nmflorea - (14:39): tmortagne: ok, so until macros can have their own translation file, Guillaume should put the translations in the core ApplicationResource.properties  \ntmortagne - (14:40): the keys, then the translations will be with the others in l10n.xwiki.org  \ntmortagne - (14:40): (keys and en version)  \nmflorea - (14:41): sure, ok thanks, I'll talk with G asap  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 14:41  \ntmortagne - (14:43): an idea: we could reuse someway your code to generate the keys in the WYSIWYG to generate what is needed by generating key and taking default value return by macros as corresponding values  \nnuvolari - (14:43): tmortagne: well, I use Chromium and it doesn't support WYSIWYG  \ntmortagne - (14:43): otherwise it will be very long to find all the keys and value  \nnuvolari - (14:43): (that was regarding the suggestion you sent me earlier)  \ntmortagne - (14:44): nuvolari: ou could another browser if you really need to use the WYSIWYG ;)  \ntmortagne - (14:44): \\*you could use  \ntmortagne - (14:44): mflorea: WDYT ?  \ntmortagne - (14:44): (about generate key and value pairs)  \ntmortagne - (14:45): that way we would not forget any macro i think  \nnuvolari - (14:47): tmortagne: I prefer applying the formatting myself.   \nvmassol - (14:47): lucaa: not sure if that answers your question but if you have a component impl that implements 2 component roles then it'll be registred twice  \nvmassol - (14:47): (by default)  \nvmassol - (14:47): so you'll have 2 instances in the component memory map  \nmflorea - (14:47): tmortagne: yes, sounds like a good idea, let me think how I can reuse the code.  \ntmortagne - (14:48): nuvolari: sure i did not suggest to use the WYSIWYG only but to use it to look at what is generated in some use case you don't know how to reproduce  \nmflorea - (14:48): nuvolari: wdym? what happens when you edit a page in wysiwyg mode?  \nvmassol - (14:48): lucaa: so yes it'll be a pb AFAIR  \nlucaa - (14:48): vmassol: well it doesn't implement two roles, it implements a role which extends another role. And the question is if also have 2 implementations with the same hint, for the 2 different roles, which one I get when I lookup?  \nvmassol - (14:49): that's 2 roles  \nlucaa - (14:49): vmassol: ok  \nvmassol - (14:49): (if they both have @ComponentRole annotations)  \nlucaa - (14:49): vmassol: yes they do  \nvmassol - (14:49): check the Component annotation  \nvmassol - (14:49): it has:  \nvmassol - (14:49): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\\*\\*  \nvmassol - (14:49): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\* When specified forces the component to be registered as many times as there are roles specified.

I'll think about it  \nnuvolari - (15:05): mflorea: it seemsa as if something is missing. it \"freezes\" with the loading animation in the centre of the screen  \nnuvolari - (15:05): \\*seems  \nmflorea - (15:06): nuvolari: ok, thanks, I'll check  \nvmassol - (16:26): jvdrean: {/pre} is fixed :)  \njvdrean - (16:26): great ! :)  \nvmassol - (16:26): (and the textarea pb with panels too at the same time)  \nSvenDowiu joined #xwiki at 16:45  \nSvenDowideit left at 16:47 (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)  \nSvenDowiu is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nmflorea - (16:48): guys, since Fabio is not online, do you know if a REST resource can have a plain text representation?
