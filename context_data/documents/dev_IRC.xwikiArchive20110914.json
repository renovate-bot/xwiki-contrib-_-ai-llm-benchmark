I have a base class A which uses component C, but this is an implementation detail for A so it makes the corresponding field \"c\" private. Then I have a class B which extends A. By coincidence, B also needs component C, also as an implementation detail (in fact it needs C for a different purpose) so it declares a private field \"c\". The bug/limit  \n09:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: IRC limitation ;)  \n09:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0because the methods from A use the field from A  \n09:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok, so it is known  \n09:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n09:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i'm saying I don't have everything you said on IRC  \n09:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it ends with \"it declares a private field \"c\". The bug/limit\"  \n09:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ah :)  \n09:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0The bug/limitation is that field \"c\" (notice that I used the same name in both A and B) is not injected in A but only in B, when creating an instance of B, which makes the methods from A fails with NullPointerException.  \n09:26\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0this is somehow normal because field \"c\" in B \"hides\" field \"c\" in A, but still I would have expected the @Inject to work  \n09:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: this one is tricky actually, the issue is that when you ask for field of the object java does not list the \"c\" coming from A I think  \n09:26\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep, I think so  \n09:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so it inject only the \"c\" form B because it only sees it  \n09:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0now if B extends A it should know that there is already c injected so it not that much of a details  \n09:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we generally either make it protected or add a get method  \n09:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I added a protected method in A to return \"c\", and changed B to use it, but I don't like the fact that B relies on an impl detail of A  \n09:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in fact I'm not sure checkstyle will like that too much  \n09:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it doesn't complain  \n09:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in any case you should probably create a jira issue  \n09:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0when I say \"impl detail\" I mean that the protected method I added shouldn't be an \"API\" of A (an API for derived classes)  \n09:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you could make you abstract a component instead if you really want it to be impl details ;)  \n09:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, but I'm thinking for the case when you want to overwrite a component from a JAR for which you don't have the source, and you don't know it defines a private field \"c\", so you define it yourself and then see that some method in base class start failing with NullPointerException  \n09:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0well, you would say that in this case you implement the interface, and don't extend the component impl  \n09:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0if you extend the impl then you should know something about that impl  \n09:38\u00a0<Denis3>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n09:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: in a perfect world yes but in any case if we can support overridden fields we should, I don't have that strong opinion to forbid it. Was just trying to reduce it's importance ;)  \n09:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure :)  \n09:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0unless it's not supported by Guice for example  \n09:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0will try to find some informations about that on @Inject specs  \n09:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:57\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0bringing myxwiki.org down in a few  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: would be great to announce it using the myxwiki twitter account (just in case)  \n09:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0can do  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying to find the credentials again for myxwiki...  \n09:59\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0it's on the upgrading page  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right  \n10:00\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0also the problem with socked exhaustion is my fat fingers, I disabled the check script in cron  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n10:00\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0there's still something wrong on our end but infra's script is apparently fine  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:01\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0An idea I had would be to add a header that says \"going down for maintainence in X minutes\"  \n10:01\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0also a placeholder while it is down..  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't we already have the skol guy?  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can ask infra to set that up if we don't have it  \n10:04\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I didn't ever see it when we ran out of sockets, I'm not really an apache expert otherwise I would have dropped a page in.  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: will the move to FS storage change anything in the DB?  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(will the attachments still be there too?)  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in addition to being on the FS)  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I want to be sure we have eveyrthing to go back in case of problem  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the DB is changed I'd say we should make extra sure to do a backup first  \n10:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0yes they will remain in the db  \n10:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0but that's a trickey situation because new ones do not  \n10:06\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0they don't get put in the db so over time we get locked in to FS attach  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll need to talk to infra to change their backup procedure for myxwiki.org btw since the directory will also need to be backuped now now  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(they have DB replication right now which won't cover it)  \n10:08\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n10:09\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0yup  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0asking infra to do a backup now and telling them about this  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll let you know once I get an answer from them  \n10:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0how are we going to do support clustering with FS attachment on myxwiki.org ?  \n10:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I just tweeted 15 minutes, should I go ahead and upgrade then do the backip later?  \n10:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0tmortagne: nfs or andrew are good solutions for clustered filesystem access  \n10:13\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0just making sure we already decided something before upgrading :)  \n10:14\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0it's down to 1 machine at the moment so until the other machine comes back it's not pressing  \n10:14\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0well it will not make it easier to go back to 2 machine  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: I'd suggest you uprgade to latest version first  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0without any attachment storage change  \n10:15\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0changed xwiki.cfg back..  \n10:17\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0entering meeting  \n10:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0k bringing it down  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:28\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:29\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0back  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that was fast  \n10:31\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0slow responses from apache...  \n10:32\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm might be because lucine is pounding the db right now  \n10:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0seems to be improving  \n10:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: the current implementation of getRenderedContent() renders the \\_translated document content\\_ using the syntax of \\_this\\_ document. This looks odd to me. Moreover, there is a test for this behavior, XWikiDocumentTest#testGetRenderedContent() which creates a document with 2.0 syntax and content and a translation of it with \\_2.0\\_ content BUT 1.0 syntax. The test expects the 2.0 content of the translated document to be rendered correctly, as 2.0 syntax  \n10:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I guess the question is if a translation can really have a different syntax than the original document  \n10:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I can check  \n10:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: officially whatever the model is (XWikiDocument for each translation here), the syntax of the default document is supposed to be used  \n10:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(which I don't like more that you do)  \n11:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see, that explains the test and the behavior  \n11:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hopefully we will get rid of all theses ambiguities with new model  \n11:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0basically only the content is supposed to be translated  \n11:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's the same for parent etc...  \n11:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK  \n11:01\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0right  \n11:01\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0all the rest should be the same  \n11:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-6056  \n11:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is another one for parent AFAIR  \n11:07\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0the panels which were changed to syntax2.0 seem to be broken  \n11:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: if I want to preserver the behavior (render translated content using the syntax of the original document) then I need to be able to access the translated content inside a component. I'm not sure what's best: (1) add DAB#getTranslatedDocument(DocumentReference) or (2) add DMB#getTranslatedDocument() or (3) add DMB#getTranslatedContent() / getTranslatedXDOM(). Note that both (2) and (3) means adding new API to XWikiDocument, so (3) seems to be the b  \n11:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0hmm, wait a sec  \n11:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: pretty sure the DAB already return you the current language translation by default  \n12:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0well, there is a problem. DAB works with DocumentReferences and returns the document from cache/database. So if you get a document that doesn't have translations, then change the content, then call getRenderedContent(), I would render the saved content if I use DAB to get the translated content.  \n12:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure you should not use DAB for anything else than saved document  \n12:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so I would need to check if the rendered document has a translation for the current language, and if so, get it with DAB, otherwise use the content returned by DMB  \n12:02\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you need to render something you did not saved yet you will need to find another solution  \n12:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: what do you mean ?  \n12:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0DAB is supposed to get the current language translation already, is the translation is saved that should work  \n12:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0is what you want to render saved or not ?  \n12:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but in the case I mentioned, if the doc doesn't have translations and its content has been changed without being saved then DAB would return the saved content. My point is that I cannot simply use DAB#getDocumentContent  \n12:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't know if it is saved or not. My component gets a DMB  \n12:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0DocumentModelBridge  \n12:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and I need to render it  \n12:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. I need to render its translated content  \n12:06\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0Hi, did we change the db schema between 2.7.2 and 3.1 ?  \n12:06\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0I see 41 tables in my 2.7.2 schema and 33 in the 3.1 one  \n12:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: ok but it's not your job to take care of situation where someone modified the document from the cache and forgot to save it  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: hmm I don't remember any change  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's ask git  \n12:07\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0all the xwiki\\*classes tables seems to be missing, for example xwikibooleanclasses  \n12:07\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0the farm is running well though  \n12:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's a general issue which is not just about translation anyway  \n12:07\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Those were removed from the mapping but there was no migration necessary for it.  \n12:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or I really don't understand your use case  \n12:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I must use the content of the DMB, otherwise I could have made the interface to take a DocumentReferences  \n12:08\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0hum on my 2.7.2 instance I get, mysql> select count(\\*) from xwikibooleanclasses; -> 0  \n12:08\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0may be those were legacy that we just removed from the mapping because they weren't used  \n12:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0for instance, this is a valid use case for me:  \n12:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0doc.setContent(newContent);  \n12:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0doc.getRenderedContent();  \n12:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok but in this case you do know the document is not saved  \n12:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0when doc.getRenderedContent() calls displayer.display(this)  \n12:09\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0s/when/where  \n12:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yo said you did not know your document was not saved  \n12:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and again this is not really related to translations  \n12:10\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the thing is that is works well when there are no translations  \n12:11\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it works because I use the DMB content (no translated content)  \n12:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm going to have to downgrade again until I can track down the cause of these panels being rendered twice  \n12:12\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0http://pastebay.com/138354  \n12:12\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n12:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: ok but it's very bad design to count on the cache  \n12:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is no contract saying that your not saved document will still be in the cache  \n12:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't count on the cache. Probably I didn't explained very well.  \n12:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0first of all, note the difference between DAB and DMB. My component take a DMB as parameters, so it uses the actual document, not the one from cache or the saved one'  \n12:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: ok but you were talking about DAB at first  \n12:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: seems to me you are doing thing too complex to use the bridge, you shoud probably directly use the oldcore API  \n12:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, because I need to take the translated content and DMB doesn't have any methods for this so I looked at DAB, which has some  \n12:15\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0(yes -> re \"you were talking about DAB at first\")  \n12:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0either directly use it or do you own specialized bridge like we do for wiki macro manipulation for example  \n12:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and no, I just need the translated content  \n12:17\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0FYI those tables have been removed from our schema, \u00a0\u00a0XWIKI-6624  \n12:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: in any case you can't use DAB for you use case since you want to manipulate directly the document  \n12:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so either you add stuff to DMB or don't use the bridge  \n12:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0either that or you give directly the document instance to your component  \n12:19\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, the option I had in mind was to use the DAB only if the language of the DMB instance != context language, in which case it's safe to load the translated content from cache/database  \n12:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no actually this can be dangerous  \n12:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since if you need other stuff they are going to probably be wrong  \n12:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since only the content is supposed to be taken into accountr  \n12:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: you only look at content of the XWikiDocument in your component ?  \n12:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0content and syntax mainly  \n12:22\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n12:22\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0also I don't understand something, why would you need to get a translation that is not the current language ?  \n12:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0aren't you always displaying in the current language  \n12:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok forget that, you do but the document is not alwaus of current language since it's the default one  \n12:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but I don't see wht you can get it from the DAB actually  \n12:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, I didn't say (or I didn't mean to say) that I get a translation that is not the current language. What I said is this:  \n12:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0enDoc.getRenderedContent() // when language is FR  \n12:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you will have the same issue that made you give the document instance instead of the reference  \n12:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since you could have modified the current language content and then call the displayer, couldn't you  \n12:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I mean what is the issue with the default language is an issue with the other language too  \n12:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but let me give you two use cases  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commits/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/resources/xwiki.hbm.xml  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(knowing that 3.1 was released on 21st of june)  \n12:27\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0vmassol: yes thanks, the commit in question is from May 16, 2011  \n12:27\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0(jvdrean 12:17 FYI those tables have been removed from our schema, \u00a0 XWIKI-6624)  \n12:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0(1) context language=FF  \n12:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0enDoc.getRenderedContent()  \n12:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0// In this case is safe to load the FR translation using DAB because \u00a0the language of the \\_this\\_ document != context language  \n12:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0(2) context language=EN  \n12:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0enDoc.setContent(\"foo\");  \n12:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0enDoc.getRenderedContent()  \n12:27\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0// In this case I can't use the DAB, I have to use the content of the provided DMB  \n12:36\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I just downgraded myxwiki yet again, apparently it has a unique problem with handling doc.display() which is not in the test version and is not new, it shows up in the old version because I downgraded the war before the xar.  \n12:36\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n12:37\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0It seems to render the content twice and then wrap it in {{html}} macros  \n12:38\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Everything seems to be alright, crontab is reenabled, I'm going to catch some sleep and then see if I can understand why that machine behaves differently from mine.  \n12:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: ok, sorry cannot help much, it's meeting day for me  \n12:49\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n13:50\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: could you give us a status of how many more changes you need in the platform to be able to run the workspace app on top of it?  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm asking since we're getting very near the end of the 3.2 release  \n14:33\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I still working on some refactorings, but I hope to make a pull request by the end of mid next week for the changes in some templates and wiki pages that I need exclusively for Workspaces.  \n14:33\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0\\*I`m  \n14:33\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: and that'll be it?  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or is there more needed)  \n14:34\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n14:34\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it should be it for the \"hooks\" part.
