I'm configuring XWiki for my installation. I want many wikis, with access permissions regulated by LDAP groups. I found that the rules which manage the right that wins in a tie (in case two rights are granted at the same time, for instance if a user belongs to more than one group) are fixed, defined in this file https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-security/xwiki-platfo  \n10:55\u00a0<scristalli>\u00a0I need a little different configuration, that's why I will recompile the appropriate module after modifying lines 126-146. I think that in general XWiki could benefit from putting such configuration in a separate file, so that it can be modified during installation without recompiling.  \n10:56\u00a0<scristalli>\u00a0What do you think? Is it best practice to open an \"idea\" type of issue on JIRA straight away or do I need some other approval first?  \n10:56\u00a0<scristalli>\u00a0Thank you.  \n10:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0of course you can submit an idea issue. You can also attach a patch to it. The discussions will come if your use case needs to be integrated by default, verifying that the use case is important  \n10:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0the discussions we usually have them on the mailinglists, since it's async  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0scristalli: you can also submit your use case as a discussion on the list  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(users list, see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/MailingLists )  \n11:01\u00a0<scristalli>\u00a0Thanks.
