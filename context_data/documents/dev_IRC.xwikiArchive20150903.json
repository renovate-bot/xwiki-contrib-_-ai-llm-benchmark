Does it work? :)  \n13:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(haven't tested)  \n13:12\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I just checked the XWikiServerClass objects  \n13:13\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0There are 4 of them , the first has a pretty name  \n13:13\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0it is the main one  \n13:13\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0the 3 remaining pretty name is emptyu  \n13:14\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0vmassol, wdyt ?  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess one solution would be to modify WikisLiveTableResultsMacros  \n13:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is the page that generates the JSON for the wiki index LT  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so one workaround would to be to write a few lines in there to remove the duplication  \n13:17\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0in our case the aliases were added from the UI  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or add back the uniquefilter at line https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-wiki/xwiki-platform-wiki-ui/xwiki-platform-wiki-ui-mainwiki/src/main/resources/WikiManager/WikisLiveTableResultsMacros.xml#L188  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not sure what other effect it may have)  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0addFilter('unique')  \n13:18\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0hmm hmm  \n13:19\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0this issue doesn't make my life very easy :)  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just try .addFilter(\"unique\") for now  \n13:19\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0in WikisLiveTableResultsMacros ?  \n13:20\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0ok  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know if it'll work but I don't have much time now to go deeper on this issue  \n13:21\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0that's not blocking and/or dangerous, we can wait for the next update :)  \n13:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unfortunately right now we're focusing on Nested Spaces for 7.2 so it probably won't be fixed before 7.3 or 7.4 et earliest  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless someone work on it...  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or provides a patch/pr  \n13:24\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0I see. Maybe XWIKI SAS will provide the fix as we have a contract support ;)  \n13:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes maybe you should see with them! :)  \n13:25\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0already done. waiting for an answer but I like to log the info myself too  \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I've tested the Page Admin and found a bug  \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no, it' just that you've done it differently\u2026  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll comment on the issue  \n13:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: ping  \n13:37\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n13:38\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: when you're back, I think there's a problem when you're on Main/WebHome and click + to create a page. By default it doesn't create a child page (ie the new page is not inside the Main space). Should I open a jira?  \n13:48\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n13:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: \u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12432 is still valid  \n13:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0will probably apply the string serialization comparison  \n13:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0at the time I did it for watchlist and then we agreed that it would be a nice to do that for EntityReference in general  \n13:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it just has to be done  \n13:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0re the create action on the homepage, that is intentional  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the logic that I applied there was to try to avoid regular users from creating most of the pages as children of the \"Main\" space, when, in fact, their intent was to create a top level document  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if they really want to create a child of the homepage's space, then they can do so using the tree picker or the location edit  \n14:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0also see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12496 related to top level document creation, since the tree picker does not currently support selecting the root (wiki)  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand the logic  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when a regular user lands on the homepage and hits create to create a document, his intent is not to create a document under the homepage's space, but as top level document  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is the problem wsith creating child documents of Main?  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you say so?  \n14:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you sure?  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0because the homepage is already present in the breadcrumbs  \n14:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you don`t need to create children of \"Main\" to have the homepage in the breadcrumbs  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not the home page  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the home of the wiki  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we talked about this  \n14:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0if you do, you`ll have the homepage twice  \n14:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0for all your pages  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again we talked about this  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there 's a jira issue for that one  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't have homrpage twice, you have Wiki home + Main space  \n14:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0why do you want to create all the pages as children of the \"Main\" space?  \n14:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0the Main space has no meaning now  \n14:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it's just a holder for the homepage  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the space we reserved for users to create content in by default  \n14:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I don't understand the special \"if\"  \n14:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I don`t agree  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see why it would be handled diffrentely than, say, the Sandbox space  \n14:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we are now creating top level documents  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what?  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no of coruse not  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we want to createc hildren documents  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's hy we introduced nested docs!  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n14:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't want just top level docs  \n14:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0do you want all your urls to be /xwiki/bin/view/Main/something/something/something?  \n14:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that`s not what I said  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so we need to find a better solution  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we are saying in essence  \n14:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that we're missing a page that materialize the home of the wiki  \n14:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I don`t follow  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you're on Main.WebHome  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can be either:  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- on the wiki home page  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- on the Main space home page  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depending on how you view it  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and wiki home page can point to another page btw)  \n14:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(doesn't have to point to Main.WebHome)  \n14:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, told you I did not write the \"if\" with \"Main.WebHome\"  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I had in mind the user's default and \"next>next>next\" behavior  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you land on the wiki, you create a page  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0why did you just create Main.MyPage ?  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0instead of MyPage(.WebHome)?  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if wiki home points to MySpace.MyPage and you're on Main.WebHome and you hit +  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it expected that you want to create a top level page? not obvious to me  \n14:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you`re not applying the same logic  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the test is on the wiki home ?  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(instead of Main.WebHome)  \n14:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\"if wiki home points to MySpace.MyPage and you're on Main.WebHome and you hit +\" => you create a child of Main.WebHome... because you landed on Main.WebHome intentionally, since it is not the wiki`s homepage  \n14:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\"(03:09:44 PM) Enygma`: yes, told you I did not write the \"if\" with \"Main.WebHome\" \"  \n14:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so in tthe example I gacve  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*gave  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I'm on Main.WebHome and I hit + it'll create a children because Main.Webome != wiki home  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0correct?  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing :)  \n14:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/templates/locationPicker\\_macros.vm#L115  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BTW seems the XWiki icon in top left is not obeying the wiki home  \n14:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I know  \n14:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I believe there is an issue  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nor is the redirect  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(root webapp redirect)  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed works fine, cool!
