 \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:13): No  \nnpm - (24/04/2009 20:13): thanks for the rapid help on this one.... i was beginning to go nutty trynig to figure out why those classes were missing even thought the data was there in other documents using SSX JSX  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:14): init is called when starting the wiki  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:14): virtualInit is called for each database  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:14): you want to call virtualinit only the frist time a given wiki is init?  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:15): We don't have all the databases during startup  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:15): Yes, isn't it like this?  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:15): in getXWiki() somewhere inside the if (xwiki.isVirtualMode()) {  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:15): yes  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 20:17  \nkaaloo left at 20:19 (\"Leaving.\")  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:20): sdumitriu: using \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"initdone\" maybe?  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:20): (to only init once)  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:20): I don't understand  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:21): sdumitriu: we need to call virtualInit() once for each wiki when it's asked right?  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:21): Yes  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:21): so one way is inside XWiki.getXWiki() to check for \"initdone\"  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:21): see if it's set to 1  \nflorinciu left at 20:22 (\"ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.9/2009040821]\")  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:22): and it not call virtualinit()  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:22): s/it/if/  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:22): But this is not needed  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:22): getXWiki is called only once  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:22): For each wiki  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:22): it's called at each request  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:22): but yes you're right  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:22): updateDatabase already calls virtualInit()  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:24): so we could simply change XWikiPluginManager  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:24): and have virtualInit() method call virtualInit() fro all plugins  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:24): without checking if it's a method declared in the plugin  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:24): I'm not sure why we're doing this btw  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:24): Hm, do we really call getXWiki for each request?  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:24): since that method is in the XWikiPluginInterface anywqy  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:24): That's a major overkill  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:24): yes in XWikiAction  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:25): it is   \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:25): I was suprrised looking at the code just now  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:25): I though it was a bit more intelligent, using a cache  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:25): but we do need to extract the info from teh url  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:25): info = name of wiki  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:26): Yes, but that's string manipulation, not database management  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:26): No wonder XWiki is so slow  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:26): is there a db mgmt somewhere?  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:26): yes for findWikiServer  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:27): and getServerWikiPage  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:27): ah no there's a cahce  \nsdumitriu - (24/04/2009 20:27): Where?  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:28): in findWikiServer  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:28): there's of course still xwiki.getDocument(serverwikipage, context);  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:28): so if the the wiki is large and the doc cache is small this is indeed a penalty  \nldubost left at 20:29 ()  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:29): btw all the synchronize are also a perf hog  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:29): all threads waiting....  \nvmassol - (24/04/2009 20:32): sdumitriu: got to go for dinner  \nChathuraPrabuddh left at 20:33 (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))  \nvmassol left at 20:33 ()  \ncypromis joined #xwiki at 20:46  \nldubost joined #xwiki at 21:12  \nevalica left at 21:30 (\"ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.9/2009040821]\")  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 21:32  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 21:37  \nancutagheorghe joined #xwiki at 21:41  \nvmassol left at 21:42 (Client Quit)  \narkub left at 21:55 (Read error: 113 (No route to host))  \ntmortagne left at 22:24 (\"Ex-Chat\")  \nflorinciu left at 22:27 (\"ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.9/2009040821]\")  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 22:28  \nvmassol left at 22:37 ()  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 22:59  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 23:03  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 23:09  \narkub joined #xwiki at 23:13  \ncypromis left at 23:17 ()  \nancutagheorghe left at 23:21 (\"Leaving\")  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 23:33  \nvmassol left at 23:38 (Client Quit)  \n\n"}
