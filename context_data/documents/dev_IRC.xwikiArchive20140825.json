After my last restart its behaving nicely for the past 1-2 days.  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have 10 jobs to fix before we can release  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need everyone to help out to fix those ASAP and start the release  \n10:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I know. I have also been a bit blocked by the false positives we get... the one with \"Unable to bind to locking port 7054 within 45000 ms\"  \n10:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0have you seen my 2 mails about the failing tests?  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0one on this topic and another on the specifics of the html export (test)  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I've seen them but I don't have an answer ATM  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0going to look at http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ldap/3514/ now  \n10:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so... basically we really need to kill running instances before we start a test  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have worked in the past on improving how they are stopped. It used to worked fine for a long time. My guess is that SOLR or something liek this is now making XWiki xwiki not stop correctly for some reason from time to time. We would need to investigate this  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now ofc killing processes is a radical answer that we could also pursue  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it won't solve the issue with xwiki not stopping for our users though)  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(so we would just hide the real problem)  \n10:52\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we also have multiple generations of tests  \n11:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0maybe we have some duplicate/deprecated tearDown code that does not properly shut down the test instance in some of our tests  \n11:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hi, is there bundled version of current development version?

 \n17:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0all pages seem to fail validation now http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards/lastBuild/testReport/ (1700 failures)  \n18:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0might be because of the doctype change?  \n18:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Enygma`: indeed  \n18:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7552  \n18:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: so what do we do about it?  \n18:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0After a discussion with vmassol, we thought we should disable validation-test during the next few weeks  \n18:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and enable them back as soon as we can  \n18:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and accept the fact that 6.2 is not valid from the html PoV  \n18:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: should I send a vote for that?  \n18:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you seem to have committed to that issue on 08/Apr/14 but the issue is still opened  \n18:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that means that several releases have passed and that issue is still opened with commits already performed on it  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: no need for a vote IMO but jsut a mail to let other know about it and ask them to let you know quickly if that's an issue  \n18:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes we have a HTML5 validator now on platform  \n18:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0we should try as much as possible to avoid having this cases  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes definitely  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's bad  \n18:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes I should have created a new issue for that  \n18:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so the issue needs to be closed and a new issue needs to be created with the remaining work  \n18:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and a proper fix version needs to be set corresponding with the date of the commit  \n18:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it`s only 1 commit so it`s easy to fix  \n18:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but it's just a very very beginning  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I was referring to the disabling of the validation tests)  \n18:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so we agree that the validation tests are going to fail  \n18:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I mean this commit is only a smal step to that issue  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I also asked gdelhumeau to check the validation tests  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because I don't think it's all or nothing  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe some tests will continue to pass on html5 and only some need to be temporarily disabled?  \n18:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0no  \n18:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because the headers are the same for every page  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex I don't see hwy all WCAG tesst woudl fail  \n18:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and there is pb on headers  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's only 1 test  \n18:11\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0hmm maybe about WCAG it's not an issue indeed  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are a lot more  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be nice if you could fix the listtool issue too Enygma`  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally it would fail the validation tests  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because in there we check for empty console logs :)  \n18:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is checked voluntarily)  \n18:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0hmm, as far as I understand it, I need to replace all usage of the list tool with regular checks on velocity lists  \n18:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0will look into it, but 1st step would be to deprecate the velocity tool on the docs  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would still fail our build rule  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that no warning goes in the logs for a release  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the code that we provide)  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not for outside extensions of course)  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually we're not fully checking this one, only through templates I think but not in wiki pages, would be nice to check  \n18:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0even for milestones?  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ideally only for final  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to report if before final  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise they won't get fixed  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's porbably best to fail even for milestones  \n18:18\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0damn... 13 wysiwyg tests failing... http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-wysiwyg/lastBuild/testReport/  \n18:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ps ax | grep jetty returns 2 lines in agent3-3  \n18:25\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not normal to have only 1 since there's no job running on it  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's see what last ran there  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's a cluster test that failed  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed: http://ci.xwiki.org/computer/agent-3-3/builds  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on this agent  \n18:27\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a012:16:50.585 [Thread-2] ERROR o.x.t.i.XWikiLogOutputStream - Error binding monitor port 8079: java.net.BindException: Cannot assign requested address  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-cluster/3487/console)  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a012:17:01.639 [Thread-2] ERROR o.x.t.i.XWikiLogOutputStream - Caused by: java.net.BindException: No available port to bind to in range [7800 .. 7850]  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0strange range  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah jgroups  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a012:17:01.639 [Thread-2] ERROR o.x.t.i.XWikiLogOutputStream - at org.jgroups.util.Util.createServerSocket(Util.java:3561) ~[jgroups-3.4.4.Final.jar:3.4.4.Final]  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm looking at the end of http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-cluster/3487/console it seems the job was forcefully stopped  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0stop failed for one instance and the other instance didn't even get a chance to try stopping  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so this caused build 175 to have problems starting xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-jmeter/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-jmeter/175/console  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a08:05:09.994 [Thread-2] ERROR o.x.t.i.XWikiLogOutputStream - java.net.BindException: Address already in use  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be interesting to know why there was no free port in the range 7800-7850 that's 50 port values  \n18:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0can I kill them?
