Is there any way to override the maven dependency in xwiki-platform-extension-test-tests in order to use my modified version of xwiki-platform-test-ui during functionnal tests ?  \n11:31\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0caubin: just build xwiki-platform-test-ui with mvn install which will put a new version in your local repository  \n11:31\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0when you build xwiki-platform-test-ui it's using the most recent jar it can find  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0a usually easier way to deal with that is to run your test from your EDI and import both projects  \n11:33\u00a0<ClmentAubin[m]>\u00a0Ok, I will try that, thanks  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0what I usually do when debugging a test: run the XWiki instance generated by the test project when run with Maven, from Eclipse debug the test  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0it will automatically start Firefox and use the currently running instance of XWiki  \n11:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne (@tmortagne:matrix.xwiki.com): plan for today  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0ok  \n12:14\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ok I'm now in the train to Paris. Seems to be working now after 1) cleaning my local repo (not sure it did something) and 2) adding a <pluginReopository> entry instead of <repository> in my pom.xml. Still don't understand why it doidn't work with my settings.xml (I'll clean up and retry once I'm on a good connexion because downloading all jars in the train is not working that well ;))  \n14:54\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:57\u00a0<simfir\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n15:02\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:02\u00a0<simfir>\u00a0has quit  \n15:09\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:39\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0has quit  \n16:43\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:53\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:25\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:39\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0Hello, how do I zip files into v2.0 to create a XAR? I noticed that a simple zip was in version 1.0 and the import does not work..  \n17:40\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0floflobel: a XAR is not just a zip  \n17:40\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0if you're using maven then the simplest is to create a maven project for them as we do (and use the xwiki maven xar plugin)  \n17:41\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0if you want to do it by hand here's a link to the spec:  \n17:41\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/XAR%20Module%20Specifications  \n17:48\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0mflorea/all: seems we have checkstyle error in platform:  \n17:48\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0[INFO] There is 1 error reported by Checkstyle 7.7 with checkstyle.xml ruleset.  \n17:48\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0[ERROR] src/main/java/org/xwiki/gwt/wysiwyg/client/plugin/link/exec/LinkExecutableUtils.java:[64,5] (metrics) NPathComplexity: NPath Complexity is 216 (max allowed is 200).  \n17:50\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0maybe someone upgraded checkstyle or changed the config?  \n17:51\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0I wonder why ci.xwiki.org doesn't have it though....  \n17:51\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0VincentMassol [m]: I export the XAR file from my wiki, I change values in the xml file, I zip all the files and when I try to import the new XAR is empty  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0vmassol: we don't see it in platform because xwiki-platform\\_Quality is stuck with a jacoco issue Enygma did not fixed yet I think  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0I upgraded checkstyle a few days ago  \n17:52\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ah yes I forgot we moved checkstyle to quality profile  \n17:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0(I don't like that too much, too easy to break IMO)  \n17:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0(I mean devs need to rememer to always build with -Pquality)  \n17:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0\\*remember  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0I always build with -Pquality  \n17:53\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0I don't  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0but checkstyle is not really linked to quality profile AFAIK  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0it's just disabled in platform jenkins job  \n17:54\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0it's a separate job?  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0so that we have those only in quality job  \n17:54\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ok  \n17:54\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0good  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne[m]>\u00a0there was no reason to block everyone for a checkstyle error  \n17:55\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ideally we'd need \"unbreakable build\"  \n17:55\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0it shouldn't be too hard to implement with jenkins pipeline now  \n17:56\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0a solution could be to commit to trunk but release from a release branch and the CI would merge a commit on the release branch when everything passes  \n17:58\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0hmm wouldn't work for the use case at hand actually  \n17:59\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0since if devs are on master then they'd still get the breakages  \n17:59\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0need to think more about how to implmeent this with our tools ;)  \n18:04\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0tmortagne (@tmortagne:matrix.xwiki.com): so what do you want to do about the CS 7.7 violations?  \n18:04\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0tmortagne (@tmortagne:matrix.xwiki.com): so what do you want to do about the CS 7.7 violation?  \n18:05\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0we can either a) configure it to behave as before or b) agree to use the new default and fix the code  \n18:05\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0btw it would be nice to run chckstyle on platform when we upgrade CS  \n18:05\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0(before committing the upgrade)  \n19:07\u00a0<keks[m]1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:41\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:41\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has quit\n"}
