I hope the one you're reverting remians in 2.0  \n09:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0Maybe not the specific implementation but there has to be an import/export format.  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok better now  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: no just this page  \n09:36\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay.  \n09:36\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it's good  \n09:36\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n09:36\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0do you like it ?  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle`: I think we should deprecate stuff when we offer solutions, don't you think?  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oterhwise as a developer  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll be at a pain to modify my code  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I won't know what to use  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically when we deprecated we need a @deprecated since XX.XXX use .....  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/deprecated/deprecate/  \n09:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0Continuing to support JRCS means major memory costs unless we donate code to improve it.  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not the issue  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm fine to replace it by something else  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we need to define by what  \n09:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0If we write something to replace it, then say: use this. It is not generic at all.  \n09:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0We are replacing one implementation with another.  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr?  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0are you saying that we shouldn't support archives?  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and thus we shouldn't replac by anything  \n09:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0The part which serializes the archive to a byte array will always be implementation bound.  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how does that rpevent saying  \n09:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0I suppose that doesn't much matter unless archives are intended to be generic.  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0use an implementation of the XXX interface for perofming bmah blah  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or even without the interface wording if we don't have one  \n09:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0So, supposing I write a new serialization mechanism, what happens if the old archive type is sent to the new mechanism? We know what happens if the new archive type is sent to the old mechanism.  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you say that there's a new serialization mechanism and that from now on it should be used  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand what you're getting at  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only thing I don't want  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to tell users not to use something  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not explaining what they should do from now on  \n09:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0getArchive() is mainly used to store the archive in hibernate which is not applicable for filesystem storage.  \n09:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle`>\u00a0But if I were to dev a new get/setArchive, I would have to face the problem of the old format being sent to it. It is just a byte array.  \n09:49\u00a0<cjdelisle`>\u00a0has quit  \n09:49\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0has quit  \n09:50\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n10:01\u00a0<cjdelisle`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0brb  \n10:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n10:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0http://incubator.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Test/27snapshots these are the errors I found on 2.7RC1  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: thanks  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sabageru: the first issue reported by sorin is the one you're working on I think  \n10:16\u00a0<jbrBridge>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:16\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0vmassol: yes..we have talked about.

What this macro does is simplu getDocument(Doc, version) and when the document is deleted it throws an exception. However in this case i do not need the actual document so it would be ok just a check, which i did by the function exists(Document, version) on my local instance. is there any a  \n16:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0shouldn't we allow this from UI ?
