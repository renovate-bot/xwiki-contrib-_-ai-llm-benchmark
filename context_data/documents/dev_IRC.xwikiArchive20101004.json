I'll ask Anca or Sergiu  \nsilviar joined #xwiki at 09:38  \ntmortagne - (09:41): sburjan: i just checked and flickrtag, flickruser and flickrusertag macros use flickr plugin so they are here but don't work  \ntmortagne - (09:41): flickr macro use rss plugin  \nsburjan - (09:43): tmortagne: they work. Tested on the last XE. but they are working only on Xwiki 1.0 syntax  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 09:43  \ntmortagne - (09:43): sburjan: actually i missread, they all use rss macro  \nsburjan - (09:44): bad thing is that they support only 1.0 syntax  \nsburjan - (09:44): but they work.. I still have no idea what was the old flikr plugin doing.  \ntmortagne - (09:44): it's just that flickr\\* macro call flickr macro  \ntmortagne - (09:45): they work only in 1.0 syntax because they use xwiki/1.0 rss radeox macro  \nsburjan - (09:46): I see. so by making the rss radeox macro 2.0 compatib, all macros that use it will support 2.0 ?  \ntmortagne - (09:46): no  \ntmortagne - (09:46): radeox macros only work in xwiki/1.0  \ntmortagne - (09:47): whatever you do top them  \nsburjan - (09:47): I see. so this could be a drawback  \ntmortagne - (09:48): the flickr macro could probably directly use the rss plugin instead of using rss radeox macro  \nsburjan - (09:48): should I file a JIRA suggestion ?  \ntmortagne - (09:53): if you want  \nsburjan - (09:56): yeah, I'll file a suggestion. Should I make the suggestion only for the flickr macros, or all radeox macros that can rely on RSS plugin ? (so this would make all the macros that use radeox to be 2.0 compatib)  \ntmortagne - (09:59): again radeox macro can't work in xwiki/2.0 syntax, you have to find a xwiki/2.0 macro equivalent to each of them to replace them  \nfmancinelli joined #xwiki at 09:59  \nmflorea left at 10:06 (Quit: Leaving.  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 10:13  \nsburjan - (10:18): well all macros that are built upon radeox rss macro, to be modified to be upon rss feed plugin (that is 2.0)  \nrrodriguez left at 10:23 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 10:25  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 10:31  \nrrodriguez left at 10:32 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 10:35  \nrrodriguez left at 10:48 (Quit: rrodriguez  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 10:51  \nsburjan left #xwiki at 10:55  \nsburjan joined #xwiki at 10:55  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 11:36  \nvenkatesh left at 11:50 (Quit: Leaving  \nsdumitriu - (12:04): sburjan: Ping  \nsburjan - (12:04): sdumitriu: pong  \nsdumitriu - (12:05): Can you document the office viewer on http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise25M2 ?  \nsdumitriu - (12:05): Ah, already done :)  \nsburjan - (12:05): :)  \nsdumitriu - (12:05): Good morning  \nsburjan - (12:05): Good morning  \nsdumitriu - (12:06): Then add some text on New User Directory  \nsdumitriu - (12:06): I was too sleepy to think of anything  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 12:06  \nsburjan - (12:06): okay.  \nevalica left at 12:22 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsilviar left at 12:26 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsdumitriu - (12:32): sburjan: Tip, when making screenshots I try to make them 700px wide  \nsdumitriu - (12:32): +2 border  \nsdumitriu - (12:35): mflorea: Would you change the default quality, please?  \nsdumitriu - (12:36): These images are really pixelated: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Main/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise25M2/comment-avatars.png  \nsdumitriu - (12:41): Everyone, please check the release notes: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise25M2  \njbrBridge - (12:47): [[[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)] In my pages I need some button like links to motivate the user do switch to a (non-xwiki) web formular.

Just a quick question from my side. Some time ago I mentioned to extend the link syntax to be able to point to a desired template. See Jira XWIKI-5473. With 25M2 I read about syntax 2.1. Great. So, as an example, what would my syntax be for pointing a link to a template?  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 14:19  \nkwoot - (14:19): Did I mention how cool I think it is to have an idea of mine somehow seems included in the code you build?

I made a python script to convert xwiki/1.0 pages to xwiki/2.0 syntax. Next I am building a php file to compare the versions and do manual correctiosn where needed. Due to the fact that I have a kid in the hospital for planned surgery and because of this also the chance to replace the kitchen, time available for xwiki stuff is currenly limited. sorry.  \nsdumitriu - (14:22): The page that was supposed to return the content of the watchlist had a deprecated check  \nsdumitriu - (14:22): It wasn't returning anything  \nsburjan - (14:22): I see. so it was a velocity level error  \nsburjan - (14:22): not some core stuff  \nsdumitriu - (14:22): Yes  \nsburjan - (14:22): I see :)  \nsdumitriu - (14:22): kwoot: Good luck with all of that  \nkwoot - (14:23): sdumitriu: thanks.

I wrote a book about it once. Well actually 7 books :-)  \nkwoot - (14:25): Maybe I should write a book about xwiki.
