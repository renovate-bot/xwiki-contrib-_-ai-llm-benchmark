 \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO that's a mistake, we shouldn't be able to administer a non existing page  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see any issue of concept though  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd create a jira issue for that  \n10:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you can administer it but not see children  \n10:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0current creating the jira`  \n10:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't know  \n10:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0that said, administration of and children of something that does not exists looks very odd for a final user  \n10:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the WebHome could not exist, but there could be some terminal pages  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree that they should go together  \n10:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and since we don't have administer space, it make sense to administer... the non existent page  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0either they are allowed or they fordbidden for both of them  \n10:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0from the core PoV  \n10:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0from the user PoV, it's weird indeed  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0administer is ok IMO if the page rights is not shown  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie you can only administer children  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well not even sure, need to think more :)  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I agree there's an issue and we need to decide  \n10:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0XWIKI-12628  \n10:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but could be evolved as needed  \n10:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0actually, we have a regression  \n10:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0there is lots of weird situation with missing WebHome, including the fact that you can, (you need to) reach them (if you want to administer them)  \n10:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for the user PoV this is really weird and not pleasing  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commented  \n10:32\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and replies  \n10:32\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n10:33\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0please, note that it is bad to have ML discussion in Jira issues, it seems to happen more and more, and so, let's create a ML thread about this !  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and replied :)  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ys I agree  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0about the ML  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Ramona2: hi  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Ramona2: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12627# is not correct IMO. Try adding annotations on the Sandbox.WebHome page and you'll see it should work  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0commenting and closing as dup since this issue already exists  \n10:38\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0i am trying no on Sandbox.WebHome  \n10:38\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0now  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok waiting  \n10:39\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0it's working ok on Sandbox.WebHome but i don't know why i see this behavior on the main page  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll see it on any dashboard I believe  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it might be caused by http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11169  \n10:40\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0but on 72m3 it worked ok  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm are you sure about that?  \n10:41\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0i test it again before creating the jira issue  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed it works on 7.1.1  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I won't close the issue  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n10:42\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0np  \n10:42\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0it happens also on 72RC1  \n10:42\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0i could reproduce the issue  \n10:46\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol, gdelhumeau: also created XWIKI-12629  \n11:57\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0With gdelhumeau, I have just notice that the Children links depend actually on the availability of the docextras, which is maybe not appropriate either\u2026 I am not sure what is the best behavior, but at least it is a change of behavior that is a breakage  \n11:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0while it could be seen nice in AWM, it could also be seen annoying for devs and advanced user, and annoying for normal user in customized site that does not consider this new constraints  \n11:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am about to open a jira, wdyt ?  \n11:59\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I think you can  \n12:02\u00a0<Denis> . http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12630  \n12:41\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:56\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:15\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:22\u00a0<gsmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<gsmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:28\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:30\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:31\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:36\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:37\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:26\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:26\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:52\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has quit  \n15:00\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:29\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:44\u00a0<cjd\\_firewall\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<cjd\\_firewall>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<cjd\\_firewall\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:23\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:47\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n20:50\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:29\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n22:29\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n22:31\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:31\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
