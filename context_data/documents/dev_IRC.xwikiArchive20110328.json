It's a self fulfilling prophecy.  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is that since xwiki 1.0 syntax is not deterministic  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not possible to do it automaitcally  \n15:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and that 1.0 syntax also mean a lot of not syntax related stuff  \n15:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0where is properly separated in new rendering  \n15:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(at least we try :))  \n15:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Yup.
