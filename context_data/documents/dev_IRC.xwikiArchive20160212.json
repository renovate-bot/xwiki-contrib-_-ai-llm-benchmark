 \n11:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0inge\\_, vmassol: you can use ConfigurationSourceProvider  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think so  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's in an existing component impl  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0converter  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0default converer I mean  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0@Inject  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha ok did not read the whole chat  \n11:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: from what I understand the question is not how to fix the code but that it's not working  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yes rendering should use the provider  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in the meantime all your can do is provide a default configuration source  \n11:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a jira issue would be nice, we can fix it easily  \n11:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was going ti say we should improve our rendering standalone tests but I think we dropped that module ;)  \n11:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0inge\\_: the easiest is to extends VoidConfigurationSource in your configuration source  \n11:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no need for standalone tests, any rendering unit test should have cough this  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have plenty of rendeirng unit tests and they didn't catch it  \n11:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it means we don't test the converter or we provided a default configuration source mock in the test withough thinking about it  \n11:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we don't have many test on converter  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's whay I mean, we can never be guaranteed that it works unless you have functional tests  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/you/we  \n12:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in that case it's the unit test that was badly written (if there is any unit test)  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a unit test will never ensure that anything works at runtime  \n12:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a rendering unit test should not mock things that are provided only in platform  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course but this specific issue should have been noticed in a unit test  \n12:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically the examples from the doc should be located in functional tests to ensure they work always  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we care about rendering working in standalone mode  \n12:02\u00a0<inge\\_>\u00a0Okay, thanks. I'll try to extend VoidConfigurationSource  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and don't forget to register your new component in components.txt)  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw if we don't mock the deps, it means it's an integration test and func test or integration tests are the same (basicalyl ensuring that different pieces of code work together) so we're saying the same thing in the end ;)  \n12:05\u00a0<inge\\_>\u00a0I'm just doing some exploratory testing, so I'll just have to register it with the EmbeddableComponentManager, right?  \n12:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't need components.txt nor annotations for that  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if you're doing explicit runtime registration against the CM)  \n12:19\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0whoa.
