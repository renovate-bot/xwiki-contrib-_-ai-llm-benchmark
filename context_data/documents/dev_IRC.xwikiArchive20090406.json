 \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 11:57): 1 for each  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 11:58): The one applying for the navigator already knows XEclipse, he did an internship last year during GSoC on it  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 11:58): asiri could also help on XEclipse, right?  \nasiri - (06/04/2009 11:59): sdumitriu: ummmm, XEclipse has evolved a lot since then :)  \njvelociter - (06/04/2009 11:59): asiri: you too ;)  \nasiri - (06/04/2009 11:59): he he  \njvelociter - (06/04/2009 11:59): (has evolved)  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 11:59): Indeed, but you can still give some hints  \nasiri - (06/04/2009 11:59): yes :)  \nxwikibot - (06/04/2009 12:18): XWiki.ebonstorm was modified by XWiki.ebonstorm (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/ebonstorm  \n\\_arunreddy\\_ - (06/04/2009 13:06): sdumitriu : hi   \nancutagheorghe - (06/04/2009 13:07): hello sdumitriu   \n\\_arunreddy\\_ - (06/04/2009 13:07): sdumitriu: couple of queries . .if you are free.  \nancutagheorghe - (06/04/2009 13:07): we have a question  \nancutagheorghe - (06/04/2009 13:07): when we change something in a class , do we have to run mvn install again?  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:07): Yes  \nancutagheorghe - (06/04/2009 13:07): tnx  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:07): To test that it still compiles and that tests don't fail  \n\\_arunreddy\\_ - (06/04/2009 13:08): coming to fileupload issue  \nancutagheorghe - (06/04/2009 13:08): ok  \nalexmaru - (06/04/2009 13:08): if it compiles, but some test fail, will it build the package?

 \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:09): It's your issue  \n\\_arunreddy\\_ - (06/04/2009 13:10): Oh   \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:10): (If you don't know, I'll tell you)  \n\\_arunreddy\\_ - (06/04/2009 13:10): :)  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:27): tachirei: I applied your patch & closed the issue as fixed.  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:27): great  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:28): FYI, the ugly xml diff was caused mostly by the bad handling of the xml-doc files. The .csproj was ok.  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:30): ok.. so in the future we sould ignore this? or I should try to edit .csproj by hand?  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:30): I'll remove the the xml-doc files from svn, to get cleaner patches & notifications. So they will exist only on local machines, and will be generated at each doc modification  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:30): will not have this issue in the future  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:31): the down side is that we won't have a centralized live doc any more.  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:31): :-/  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:31): florinciu: What's with the XML? Is it auto-generated from documentation inside the classes, or is that how MS handles documentation?  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:32): If it's generated, then it definitely shouldn't be in the svn  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:33): florinciu: I don't understand: what exactly will be removed? the .csproj?  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:34): It is a xml file containing all documentation in the project. It provides consitency on the doc. Without it you don't get warnings about outdated documentation  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:34): but you are right, it doesn't have to be in the svn  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:34): tachirei: The xmldoc will be removed  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:35): The .csproj shouldn't be there ideally, but since we don't have an easy way to generate it (like the maven plugin that generates eclipse or idea projects), we'll have to keep it in there  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:36): no, the .csproj is similar to the .pom So we definetly need it  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:37): .csproj is not dependent on the IDE, it's the projects description.  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:37): Oh, OK  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:42): florinciu: I'm going to try to create a patch for XWIKI-68 (the temporary solution: changing syntax from XWiki 2.0 to XHTML)  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:42): how do you think it's better (considering this is temporary)  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:42): to alert the user with an Yes/No/Cancel dialog when he/she insert a table into the document  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:43): or to alert the user when publishing page to XWiki  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:43): when it's better for the user to know that a table means changing syntax?  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:43): I'll create a subtask for it.  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:44): or the user should not know at all about this workaround?  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:44): tachirei: I don't know if it's worth the effort  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:44): to create this temporary patch?  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:44): or the confirmation dialog?  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:45): It's a solution I don't like, and it has a real cause in a completely different part of the platform  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:45): (the temprary fix)  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:45): I undersand..  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:45): florinciu, WDYT?  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:45): Alerting the user on publishing seems ok. Detecting table insertion when it occurs is a bit triky in VSTO.  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:45): it's not really a fix. It's a notification on a limitation/bug  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:46): yes...  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:47): but we don't know how much time the issue (regarding paragraphs in table cells) will unresolved.. and XWord would be a great tool for inserting tables in XWiki pages ...   \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:47): so is it ok to create this temporary solution? or should I leave it...  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 13:48): florinciu: I'll let you decide, since it's your project  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:50): tachirei: we already have ways of creating tables in the wiki. But that's not the issue here.  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:50): Anyway it's a less then 20-30 lines of code implementation.  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:50): true  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:52): it will be a temporary solution + I get to know XOffice solution better (not just XWikiLib project) :)  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:52): you can go for it if you want to. It's not complicated, and it's \u00a0good way of starting some VSTO dev.  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 13:53): ok  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:54): I want you to try to alternate the first issues on XWikiLib(non-VSTO) and XWord(VSTO).  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 13:59): tachirei: You can also assign to yourself the issue you just reported  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:01): XOFFICE-73?  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 14:01): yes  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:03): done  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:04): btw: when I assigned the issue to me it took a while before receiveing the HTTP response.. and, even if the action was completed, I got the following message:  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:04): Repository groceries on http://fisheye2.atlassian.com/ failed: repository not in correct state: Repository is stopped  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:04): actually 4 messages like that?  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 14:05): on jira?  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:05): yes  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 14:05): Ignore that  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:05): ok. thanks  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 14:07): Fisheye hasn't been working well in a long time. you can use this to track svn changes: http://svnsearch.org/svnsearch/repos/XWIKI/search  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 14:07): It's the SVN commits tab that uses an external service for this  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 14:07): And the external service is down  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 14:08): Make sure you keep the Comments tab open, not the others  \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:08): ok  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 14:15): tachirei: you have 3 tasks assigned. The two above + XOOFICE-69.   \ntachirei - (06/04/2009 14:17): yes.. I'll try to finish those tasks in a few days  \nflorinciu - (06/04/2009 14:18): ok  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 14:28): anamariastoica: How's your issue?  \nglerouge - (06/04/2009 14:28): mja: so you would like to work on one of the other gadgets on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GoogleSummerOfCode/WikiActivityGadgets  \nglerouge - (06/04/2009 14:28): specifically the world map of users  \nmja - (06/04/2009 14:28): yes   \nmja - (06/04/2009 14:29): I would love to do it in the style of \"Nightlights\" where they show the night time distribution of lights in the world. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would also implement a comparative representation of popularity as well as real-time activity of various wiki-hosting services.  \nanamariastoica - (06/04/2009 14:33): sdumitriu: working on it, no questions for now. thanks for asking  \nsdumitriu - (06/04/2009 14:34): I hope you know that you should only write inside the wiki, no java code, right?
