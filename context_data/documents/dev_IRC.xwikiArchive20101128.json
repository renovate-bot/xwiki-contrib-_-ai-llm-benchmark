However the logic of building the title is not so trivial so I wanted to create a function for it elsewhere and just call it in the title field somehow.  \nLukemon - (21:03): I defined a velocity macro and included it with #includeInContext, but it doesn't work in title (in content it works fine)  \nvmassol left at 21:04 (Quit: Leaving.  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 21:21  \nflorinciu left at 21:22 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nabusenius\\_ left at 21:22 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 21:22  \nnickless is now known as abusenius ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nabusenius is now known as abusenius\\_ ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nabusenius\\_ left at 21:23 (Client Quit  \nabusenius\\_ joined #xwiki at 21:23  \nlpereira joined #xwiki at 21:44  \njvelociter - (21:44): Lukemon: it's not recommanded  \njvelociter - (21:44): it's not going to be supported properly everywhere  \njvelociter - (21:45): Lukemon: you can do something else : add a notification upon document save, and when your properties change, you compute a new title  \njvelociter - (21:45): just an idea  \nLukemon - (22:01): ok thanx, maybe I'll do it in future :)  \nLukemon - (22:04): for now I created MyClassTitleSheet which renders title and in title I have only #includeInContext(\"MyClassTitleSheet\")  \nrrodriguez left at 22:05 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nLukemon - (22:05): but I agree that your idea is better  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 22:06  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 22:07  \nlucaa left at 23:25 (Ping timeout: 264 seconds  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 23:27  \nlpereira left at 23:28 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa left at 23:34 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \n\n"}
