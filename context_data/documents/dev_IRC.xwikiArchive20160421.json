To reduces the chance of an attacker access.  \n10:12\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:19\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:59\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:34\u00a0<martinus\\_\\_>\u00a0M-cjd, are you around ?  \n12:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0revapi-check \u00a0fails on me when trying to build xwiki-platform-test-ui : \"java.class.removed: class org.xwiki.test.ui.po.CopyStatusPage: Class was removed.\" \u00a0I guess it is only me, as jenkins is still happy ?  \n12:36\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:59\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n12:59\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:09\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0According to https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/How+can+I+change+the+Session+timeout I'm wondering what exactly means \"session time out\". Has it something to do with automatically logout after 30 min no user-interaction with the system?  \n13:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, that is the usual session timeout from the container; XWiki does not change that  \n13:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: re revapi you are not the only one it seems  \n13:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok. some comfort ;) \u00a0though it is abit distracting to have this on BFD  \n14:17\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0Thx, for your answer, ClemensR. I'm testing it and it seems that I'm still logged in, after 30 min doing nothing in the system..  \n14:20\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok. I am trying to remember if session timeout actually means logout ... I remember XWiki uses some framework to keep authentication information that does not depend on sessions  \n14:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWiki remember the credentials in the cookie  \n14:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(so that you are automatically authenticated when you come back)  \n14:35\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:35\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:05\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:05\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n15:05\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n17:00\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n17:05\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n17:56\u00a0<troy1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:05\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n18:05\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:05\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:20\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit\n"}
