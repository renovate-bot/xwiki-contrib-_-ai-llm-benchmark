 \n14:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it should not call getXObject(DocumentReference classReference)  \n14:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not this one  \n14:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I meant getXObject(EntityReference classReference, boolean create, XWikiContext context)  \n14:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha no  \n14:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0forget that I did it properly  \n14:22\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0oups, the ObjectAddAction seems broken  \n14:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but i'm sure there is many places using getXObject(DocumentReference classReference, boolean create, XWikiContext context) or newXObject with an absolute Reference, but I think I still prefer fix all thoses places  \n14:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0now to be safe I'm not sure we should trust it too much for id used in the database for the store  \n14:24\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0well  \n14:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes ObjectAddAction is where I found the code I pasted  \n14:25\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0why not ensure setXClassReference to be local, and put a warning that show who is breaking the rules  \n14:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not the same thing  \n14:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0this is not storage  \n14:25\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if we force setXClassReference to be local then it's just useless  \n14:26\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I means, since we do not support absolute reference for now, why not ensure these are relatively stored, and provide a warning in the log that we have something the is breaking our rules, leaving this until we support absolute references  \n14:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0again that's not that simple, the fact that one impl does not support classes coming from another wiki is one storage implementation limitation  \n14:27\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0best of both world IMO: keep the initial IDE of the API, warn when we try to use currently unsupported feature, fix on the fly, so we can fix every places smoothly  \n14:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if we change the model to foce local there is no way to come back  \n14:27\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0s/IDE/idea/  \n14:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's what I said earlier and in the mail about object relative references  \n14:28\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I do not say we change the API  \n14:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if we change that then it's forever and only the new model will be able to support it  \n14:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0thats exactly what you said  \n14:28\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0no  \n14:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0setXClassReference is API  \n14:29\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0ok  \n14:29\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0agreed that this cause a temporary link between the object API and the store  \n14:29\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but it is a temporary measure, to have something solid  \n14:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not temporary, you can't suddently change back the behavior after that  \n14:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0until we are sure we have properly fix all the issues  \n14:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not just us  \n14:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lot of people are using this API  \n14:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and do the same mistake  \n14:31\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure, but it is a mistake  \n14:32\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so either we left everyone on there own, and fix only our part, and existing user will start to have there code broken, or we temporary fix it in setXClassReference, with a warning saying that you are not doing things properly and that you we be unsupported in the future  \n14:33\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0s/we/will/  \n14:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see how to define how much time is temporary here  \n14:33\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0as long as we do not have a store that support it  \n14:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0IMO it's safer to say that this API does not support classes comming from another wiki and that the new model will bring that  \n14:33\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0or for let say the 4.x releases  \n14:34\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I am not sure I follow what you propose ?  \n14:35\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0you seems to propose two opposites  \n14:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I'm saying that BaseCollection make sure the wiki is never part of the relative xClassReference not as a temporary hack that we will never be able to remove but officially as a limitation of this API  \n14:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0no i'm not  \n14:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I'm saying that I want something stable and safe  \n14:36\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0we agree on that last one  \n14:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and IMO it's not as easy ass you think to come back to previous bahavior if we change it  \n14:37\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0currently, this is what happening  \n14:38\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0even if you used absolute reference, nothing gets broken, and seems to works, and since 4.x, we notice that we have absolute reference all over the place, something that do not follow our own rules  \n14:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I'm proposing what I already proposed in http://markmail.org/message/loekkomlc3zdoiqk basically  \n14:39\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so, you finally propose to change rules, which means many resolver and API we have prepared, are now useless  \n14:39\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0which number ?  \n14:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I voted 2/ if you look at the mail  \n14:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a02/ is OK if we say that with BaseObject we will never support classes coming from another wiki. The next storage will have different kind of names for objects anyway not based on classes from what we discussed. It's a +0.5 for me (no solution give me 100% satisfaction but this one is the best until other arguments are exposed)  \n14:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I would be ok to keep the current API too and fix places but provided that you don't trust it for ids since IMO it's not safe  \n14:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyone can do a mistake and you get the same issue  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but in any case a \"temporary\" thing is just totally useless  \n14:45\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0\"provided that you don't trust it for ids since IMO it's not safe\" does not means anything to me, object badly formed are badly stored in a store that do not support it, I so no issue with that except that we may avoid to store it at all  \n14:46\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0s/so/see  \n14:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: the store does not take into account the class wiki so it does not really have any issue with this kind of objects  \n14:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but if you generate id based on this kind of mistake it's another story  \n14:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0the store applied that it store only object from class of the local wiki, no more  \n14:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0s/applied/implied  \n14:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so, the normal behaviour would be to not store object of an non-local wiki  \n14:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0the id are computed in the XObject, not in the store !  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: I know but it's only only by the store  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/only/used/  \n14:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and has been done for the store  \n14:49\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but we may implement a store that will support them properly  \n14:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we need a solution for 4.0 if it makes impossible to copy wikis  \n14:51\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so, IMO, if an object is linked to a non-local class, and we want to store it in the current store, we cant. However, we have tolerate almost transparently this issue until today, but it was a bug  \n14:53\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0if we build object properly, there is no issue  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure I never said it was not wrong  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all i'm saying is that temporary changing setXClassReference behavior is not the right way  \n14:54\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0when I propose a temporary measure, it is simply because wrong code was working by luck, and we need some time to fix it  \n14:54\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0it is only for helping fixing the wrong code, not to support it  \n14:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I really don't see how we will be able to go back to previous behavior that easily without any complain  \n14:55\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0the only side improvement I see, is to also prevent our store to store non-local object and complains  \n14:56\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I do not see why we will start to ignore wiki name  \n14:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: IMO the store should store the object but make sure it link to local class since that's what the user was expecting even if he used the wrong coed  \n14:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0code  \n14:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0IMO that's better than loosing objects...  \n14:57\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0than we have written a lot of useless code to support non-local classes,  \n14:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the store does not support it  \n14:58\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not loosing object, complaining about them  \n14:58\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0the store does not support them today, but the object API does  \n14:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you call not saving object linked to class from another wiki not loosing objects ?  \n14:58\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not saving document containing object....  \n14:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok so throwing an exception then not just complaining  \n14:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in that case +1  \n14:59\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0complaining means throwing in my mind, sorry for confusion  \n15:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since you were just talking about the object I tough you wanted to filter them  \n15:00\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0no, of course not  \n15:01\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0what I am afraid is that implementing this will broke many places, and this is why I had propose a temporary way of fixing them all \"silently\" until we know we are ok, in place of facing unexpected really bad issues  \n15:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n15:02\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0allowing, us and other, to face the issue gently  \n15:02\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but we could be hard as well  \n15:02\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0it is anyway a major release  \n15:05\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0there is however another consideration, the roadmap...  \n15:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok lets put it that way maybe then: we move this from ok to warning during 4.x (i.e. your temporary solution) and to error beginning with 5.0 but i'm afraid we will just forget about it and leave it that way forever  \n15:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(I'm pretty sure we will forget actually)  \n15:07\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0means putting error right now, and preventing it with a warning in the object API, so there is only one line to remove later  \n15:08\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0put info the developper part on the release notes, for all release until we remove it  \n15:08\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so we do not forget  \n15:09\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0do you expect me to do it asap ?  \n15:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you won't get any error because the modification in the set prevent it, that's what I meant  \n15:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0even if the error will already be in the store  \n15:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the error code  \n15:09\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0we say the same  \n15:10\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so, should I implement it asap ?  \n15:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we need to do something for 4.0, if you can do it right now then great but I think it need a vote mail first  \n15:10\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:11\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0this means we release M2 without it then ?  \n15:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0should not be too long, everyone seems to be connected, just to be sure everyone seen the proposal and understand it  \n15:12\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0ok, I let you write the mail, I start looking at the code...  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: shouldn't we accept eddy's pull request for user profile customization before the release?  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Enygma`)  \n15:30\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: there's also merge annotations with comments  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: replying to your mail  \n15:31\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: and the customizable user directory, of course :)  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's the one I was referring to  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed there are 3  \n15:32\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't looked at the user profile custo yet  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just the user dir one  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're too productive, hard to keep up ;)  \n15:32\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0right :)  \n15:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: from what I see in the user dir pull request it seems pretty safe to incorporate now, wdyt?  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: wdyt?  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just replied to the mail)  \n15:36\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I looked at it too and it seems OK  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd like to move this to a separate module but it can be done after  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I commented in the pull request)  \n15:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: did not reviewed it yet  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just to be sure (haven't checked that), the UI to customize it accessed from the admin page right?  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/it/it is/  \n15:40\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: yes, it's accessed from administration (but it can also be accessed as a simple page in the XWiki space)  \n15:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: wait  \n15:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: user directory?  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0no, the customize action is done on the user directory page itself  \n15:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and it stores the customization in the user profile  \n15:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so that each user can have his own user directory view  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n15:41\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0check the jira with pictures  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I checked them  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's important for me is to be able to customize wiki wide  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like add some fields  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this can be done with the override page AFAIU  \n15:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0no  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that's this customization for users?  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would users want to customize the user dir  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/that/what/  \n15:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0to search for other users by some fields that are not displayed by default  \n15:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0since the admin can`t think of everything  \n15:43\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0or to hide some fields that are not interesting to him  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still don't understand  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why only some user will see the customization and not others  \n15:44\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0who said that?
