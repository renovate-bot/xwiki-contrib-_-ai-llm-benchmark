I am writing a XWQL query and I want to sort by a property of an object  \n13:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I see that we have in the documentation the following query  \n13:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0from doc.object(Blog.BlogPostClass) as blog where blog.published = '1' and :category member of blog.category and blog.hidden = '0' and doc.web = 'Blog' order by blog.publishDate desc  \n13:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am interested in the \"order by blog.publishDate desc\" part  \n13:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I want to hava a variable for publishDate, so I can order using another property  \n13:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0i am writing \"order by blog.:myvalue).bindValue('myValue', $myProperty)  \n13:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but it does not work. Does anybody have an idea what am I missing ?  \n13:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0That's not possible  \n13:12\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0bindValue binds a value, not a column name  \n13:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0It can only be used for things that are looked for in the database, not for names of things (tables, columns, functions...)  \n13:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so my only choice is to \"prepare\" the \u00a0object.property value outside the query ?  \n13:14\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n13:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I was imagining I can concet object. + a property received by value  \n13:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\\*concat  \n13:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thanks sdumitriu  \n13:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n13:52\u00a0<buddhi>\u00a0has quit  \n14:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:28\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n15:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:53\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:24\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Hello.

 \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what http://markmail.org/message/td2v2xmaz5iqxvn3 says  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0schema is working yes  \n17:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't seem to indicate patching anything in that mail  \n17:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and that was way before schema mode was implemented  \n17:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I can't remember exactly what I did but I do remember that it \"sort of\" worked  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: are you ok to say that database mode is not supported for pgsql?  \n17:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0The code for supporting postgres has existed for a long time but was originally mostly non-functional  \n17:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I am not entirely sure just what I did, possibly I thought I had database-per-wiki working but in reality it was only schema-per-wiki in practice.  \n17:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I do remember that I thought I had solved the problem then later on other issues came up and I lost interest in it  \n17:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I'm OK to say I don't know :)  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then I'll explcitiyl mention in the doc that we only support scheam mode for pgsql  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0till the pgsql driver supports it  \n17:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I do seem to recall that in order to swap databases in postgres, you have to open a new tcp connection.  \n17:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all I know is that peoples on the mailing list like cjd in http://markmail.org/message/td2v2xmaz5iqxvn3 indicated doing multiwiki with postgresql  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: yes  \n17:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the database is set in the constructor of ProtocolConnectionImpl  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and cannot be changed afterwards  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's a pgsql driver class)  \n17:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and making that work would be hacking up hibernate... frameworks are nice until they bite you ;)  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the only way to make it work in db mode  \n17:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is to remove the connection pooling  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that you get a new connection every time  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's not going to work well re performances  \n17:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0indeed  \n17:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0could have one hibernate instance per wiki, possibly it would be \"nicer\" in other ways too  \n17:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but that's a big project ofc  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I think we're ready for the 4.5.4 and 5.0.2 releases, hoping that I didn't break anything with my last commit\u2026.  \n17:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if someone could review my commit that would make me feel more safe\u2026 :)  \n17:35\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0vmassol: Good to go?
