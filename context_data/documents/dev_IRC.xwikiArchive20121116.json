I reported them. I guess you can move them to 4.3 final  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it kind of defeat the purpose of a release candidate to move blocker issue to the final version  \n10:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I know, but what can I do ?  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you probably nothing directly but we need to find someone to work on theses issues, they won't fix themself anyway if we move them to 4.3 final and from what I can see we can't release 4.3 with that  \n10:59\u00a0<jvelo\\_>\u00a0Enygma`: apparently the appwithinminutes failed tests are failing for a couple of builds already, doesn't look like they are flickering  \n10:59\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0jvelo\\_: the 5 failing tests are failing because selenium fails to scroll the items into view. You can ignore them.  \n11:00\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0however, the one I`ve mentioned before is new and we must see if it's a flicker  \n11:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes  \n11:01\u00a0<jvelo\\_>\u00a0OK, I triggered a build  \n11:12\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:16\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0gotta love failing tests that stay in the test suite from release to release :)  \n11:17\u00a0<jvelo\\_>\u00a0I've run the comparisonversiontest locally successfully..  \n11:17\u00a0<jvelo\\_>\u00a0let  \n11:17\u00a0<jvelo\\_>\u00a0let's wait for the CI test and go forward if it passes  \n11:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Inge-: yes, but those tests are not failing due to the feature/product.  \n11:22\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0shouldn't we mark them as @Ignore though ?  \n11:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0because it's not obvious they are a \"legit failure\"  \n11:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0for example if you were not there this morning, maybe I wouldn't have had that info  \n11:23\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0a \"legit failure\" is poison in a dev team.  \n11:23\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0imho  \n11:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0well the term is not well chosen I reckon  \n11:24\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0It basically says that \"It is ok for tests to fail, and we don't really care that much about the testing system\" :)  \n11:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0thus the quotes  \n11:24\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0I just see that once it is OK for the tests to come up in the red, people lower their guard.  \n11:25\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I agree that's why I ask if we shouldn't better mark them as @ignore with a comment explaining why\\  \n11:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: anything you can do about those tests, or do we have to wait for selenium to fix their method?  \n11:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: while starting XEM 4.3-m2, the DW shows me the XEM UI, but under the description, I see \"Website: extensions.xwiki.org\". However, the link on extensions.xwiki.org points to http://extensions.xwiki.org/?id=org.xwiki.manager:xwiki-manager-ui:::/xwiki-commons-pom/xwiki-enterprise/xwiki-manager/xwiki-manager-ui That only leads to the e.x.o homepage. Was it supposed to do something else? If not, then what's with the id parameter?  \n11:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you have to wait for me to finish updating the selenium 1 tests to work on webdriver-based-selenium so that they ca run on the latest FF so that we can upgrade the FF on the CI agents  \n11:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: also, below that I see \"Installed for all the wikis in the farm\". What's the purpose of this message?  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: there is no page for XEM on extensions.xwiki.org, that's why you are rediected to home page  \n11:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0otherwise that would be a redirect to the extension that registered that ID ?  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n11:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I see  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: what distribution are you talking about exactly when you say XEM ?  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a WAR in tomcat ? something elese ?  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/elese/else/  \n11:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: xwiki-manager-jetty-mysql-4.3-milestone-2  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then I don't understand why what it's indicating you that the UI is already installed  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or are you talking about the WAR ?  \n11:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should have first the WAR which is installed and then the UI which is not yet installed in DW  \n11:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m installing xwiki-manager-jetty-mysql-4.3-milestone-2 on an empty mysql database  \n11:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I understood that part  \n11:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and now I`m installing the UI/xar trough DW  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I don't understand is what extension you are talking about for \"Installed for all the wikis in the farm\"  \n11:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0XEM UI  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the it's saying the UI is already installed ?  \n11:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0under description, below Website, I saw that message  \n11:40\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I don`t think so, I think it's the actual description of the extension  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0downloading it to see it :)  \n11:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0preparing a screenshot  \n11:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that the summary of that extension is supposed to be \"XWiki Enterprise Manager - Web\"  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so this message doe snot come from it  \n11:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: http://imgur.com/9TAAR  \n11:44\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: didn't fail this time, moving on  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha ok so you did started to install it  \n11:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: it was there before as well  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I tough that what you were seeing without doing anything  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n11:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I just started to install and then switched back to the tab to make the screenshot  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this message does not sounds right to me  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: any idea ?  \n11:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying to reproduce  \n11:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0before starting the install, I had the buttons Install, Install on Farm and another one which I don`t remember  \n11:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I pressed Install, but again, that's not relevant :)  \n11:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok indeed same here  \n11:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: that's not the extension summary. It's just one info from the extension description section (along with license, website, etc.). It just tels you where the extension is install. I don't know why you get it when the extension is not installed.  \n11:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: for some reason the UI is telling me that the extension is installed on root  \n11:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0need to debug it  \n11:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0is it installed at all?  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nop  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have the install button  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm this remind me of something else  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we had a similar issue recently  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0where it was talling me the extension was already installed when clicking on install button  \n11:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tryingg to remember what was the exact issue  \n11:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no, it's different  \n11:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: that's what I also imagined, that the information displayed is just part of the description of the extension, not that it's a status test or anything, like you are implying.  \n11:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0\\*test=text  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it was a bit different since it was a but in the installplan job  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0bug  \n11:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway debugging it  \n11:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: the list of wikis where the extension is installed in displayed in virtual mode (see #displayExtensionDetails\\_description) and the macro that is called #displayExtensionDetails\\_description\\_wikis does a bad test (now I don't remember writing this test)  \n11:53\u00a0<jvelo\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it assumes the extension is installed in the entire farm is it has no namespace set  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes the test is wrong  \n11:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0#if (!$extension.namespaces || $extension.namespaces.isEmpty())  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i should use #isInstalled($wiki)  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm actually this test should be in displayExtensionDetails\\_description probably  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since the whole code in displayExtensionDetails\\_description\\_wikis is useful only if the extensions is installed  \n11:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0indeed  \n11:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0can you fix it, I don't have a XEM to test  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep I'm on it  \n11:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n11:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: good catch, creating the jira issue and committing  \n11:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0cool  \n12:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: pheuf... 36 conflicts while installing XEM UI...  \n12:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like what ?  \n12:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0some code changes, translations (lot of them), webhome, welcome pages, Application Manager stuff, I don`t remember all of them :)  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha I misunderstood I tought you were talking about conflict in the install plan  \n12:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah, no, conflicts while installing, requiring the user's attention to merge  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: you have all those conflict when installing from scratch ?  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0with empty database I mean  \n12:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, empty mysql db  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm so it's all conflict between XEM and XE UI then  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what conflict tdo you have with application manager ?  \n12:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`m doing this because I need to fix XEM/workspace translations that are no longer automatically registered at build time as translation bundles, since they are now installed as extensions... and I need to use the new localization API to register them :)  \n12:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0will test it anyway since it sounds a bit weird for application manager  \n12:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, you`d have to do it again, since I don`t remember specifics...  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the conflict between XE and XEM itself are a bit harder to fix, need to make some tricky test in XAR handler to take into account extension overriding another one in the same install when one is a dependency of the other  \n12:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: about my translations problem... I currently notice that the XemResources.Translation page is registered as a translation bundle, but on the homepage, the keys are not being found  \n12:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I wonder if a restart solves it  \n12:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: hmm it may be because XWikiPreferences has been imported before the page  \n12:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: after a restart the translations are loaded  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the new l10n module update the translations cache when XWikiPreferences is modified  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or at startup  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I need to think about it  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's probably what cause thee issue you have with workspaces too  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is there a jira issue for the workspaces translation issue you were talking about ?  \n12:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0no, I`m currently investigating  \n12:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so the WorkspaceManager.Install page registers translations on view. However, the newly registered translations are not loading  \n12:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it's the cache again  \n12:18\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so even if XWikiPreferences was saved (when the translations were registered), the cache is still not updated...  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in any case it looks like a l10n module bug  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0will try to reproduce it  \n12:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0hmm... in this case, the translations will not load even after a restart  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why ?  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0th epreferences page is already modified  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at startup  \n12:19\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, but the translations are still not loaded even so  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the right translation are loaded in the cahce  \n12:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you mean XWikiPreference is not taken into account no matter what ?  \n12:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it seems that XWikiPreferences was taken into account after a restart, but only when the translations were registered by ApplicationManager (in my previous case). In this other case, when the translations are registered by the WorkspaceManager.Install velocity code, XWikiPreferences is not taken into account, even after a restart  \n12:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I do see a couple of exceptions on wiki startup  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well all that is supposed to do the same thing, modify xwikipreferencs  \n12:21\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but they don`t seem related  \n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0application manager does not do anything special  \n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it just add translation page if it's not already there  \n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should check if what is in xwikipreference is correct  \n12:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ERROR .x.x.s.XWikiHibernateBaseStore - Failed creating schema update script  \n12:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and  \n12:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0java.lang.NullPointerException: null  \n12:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0don't know if it's related but looks like a serious issue  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0WikiResources.Translations,XAppResources.Translations,XemResources.Translations, WorkspaceManager.Translations  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this is what I have in xwikipreferences  \n12:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all is taken into account except WorkspaceManager.Translations ?  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0LOL  \n12:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds like a bug with the white space  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0there was a whitespace after the comma just before the workspace translations  \n12:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes  \n12:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I tough I had used the same code to cut the list  \n12:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n12:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0try to remove the white space to be sure  \n12:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tried  \n12:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and it works without the whitespace  \n12:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n12:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so definetly the new code processes the list diferently  \n12:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and you sure it was working before with the white space, right ?  \n12:24\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, I did not touch that code in a while  \n12:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I copy pasted the code to but the list actually but maybe there was some cleanup before the this code  \n12:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes that's it  \n12:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the old core cut only on , but it trim the document names  \n12:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's so crappy, anyway  \n12:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0...there is another problem with XEM  \n12:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0since probably the XEM UI is installed before the other dependencies (wiki manager, workspaces, applications manager), the customized XEM UI pages are overriden by the standard extension pages  \n12:33\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this causes WorkspaceManager.Install and XemManager.Install to have no xars attached to them  \n12:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: no dependencies are always installed first  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but if you are on 4.3M2 there is a bug with objects  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now attachments should be ok  \n12:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have to go, back in about 1h  \n12:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n12:41\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0hum, after running the release-translations.sh script, I have some translations document that have new attachments, or new objects  \n12:41\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0does that make sense ? aren't objects and attachments only in non translations files ?  \n12:56\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: any idea ?  \n13:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0jvelo: that sounds weird  \n13:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0do you have many such translations?  \n13:02\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, Did you read my messages in xwiki-dev list?  \n13:02\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Welcome and XWikiSyntax  \n13:03\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0Enygma`: the only 2 documents with document translations AFAIK  \n13:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and what objects do they have?  \n13:03\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0and Sandbox.WebHome  \n13:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0crocket: not yet  \n13:04\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0basically Sandbox.WebHome has attachment XWikiLogo.png added  \n13:04\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Enygma`, It's something xwiki should already have.  \n13:04\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0and XWikiSyntax has an image + a SSX object  \n13:05\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0basically both have added the attachment and objects of the non-translation document I imagine  \n13:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0jvelo: so you have XWikiSyntax.fr.xml for instance having objects and attachments in it?  \n13:22\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0yes  \n13:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0does not sound right  \n13:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I must admit I don't know really how the export from l10n works  \n13:35\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0tmortagne: any idea ?  \n13:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0right, http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/L10NCode/GetTranslationFile?name=XE.XWikiXWikiSyntax&app=XE generates translation files with objects in them  \n13:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: I modified l10n to duplicate the default language version when generating a transslation  \n13:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the idea being to have the proper syntaxe, hidden etc.  \n13:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0will make sure to reset attachments and objects  \n13:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0jvelo: should be better now  \n14:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks  \n14:44\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0How does xwiki choose a specific component in a componenet role?  \n14:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crocket: a component declare a component role (which is a Type) and a component hint (which is a String)  \n14:46\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, How do I pass a hint?  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crocket: in which use case ? did you look at http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Component+Module ?  \n14:48\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, I was reading http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingComponents  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crocket: in http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingComponents you can see things like @Named(\"database\")  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the hint  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the role generally being the interface  \n14:49\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, How do I choose the database implementation from a snippet or another component?  \n14:50\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0indeed there is no example in http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingComponents  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for the injection it's the same annotation  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so like you put @Named(\"database\") in the implementation you do the same after the @Inject  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for getInstance if you look at the API you will see that it can take several arguments  \n14:51\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the second one being the hint  \n14:53\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, I'm confused.  \n14:55\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, Can I implement the Role interface as a ScriptService?  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crocket: see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/WritingComponents again  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I updated the example with database hint  \n14:55\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0public class HelloWorldScriptService implements ScriptService  \n14:56\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0It's absurd to have another class for ScriptService.  \n14:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure I understand what you mean  \n14:56\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I'd rather export the interface role as a scriptservice.  \n14:56\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0If I changed the interface, I'd have to change the separate ScriptService class.  \n14:57\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I don't want duplicity.  \n14:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ScriptService is used it to indicate that this class is a script service  \n14:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/it/here/  \n14:57\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Can an interface be a script service?  \n14:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that would not make sense, a component by definition is an implementation  \n14:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can have an interface describing what's in your script service if you want  \n14:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but script languages won't care  \n14:58\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0damn it  \n14:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what are you trying to do ?  \n14:58\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I should just put a factory method in the sciprt service.  \n14:58\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0Like Runtime.getRuntime()  \n14:58\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, I want to make a sort class that sorts XWiki Objects according to its properties.  \n15:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so what is the issue with the script service ?  \n15:00\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, If I had a separate script service class apart from the actual interface, I'd have to update the script service whenever I changed the component role.  \n15:01\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0I want to invoke the sort class in wiki pages.  \n15:01\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0So that I can sort wiki objects easily.  \n15:01\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0$sorttool wouldn't do.  \n15:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0crocket: you can implement several interface in your script service  \n15:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you want to be sure your script service have all the proper methods  \n15:03\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, What if I want different component implementations?  \n15:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or if your the tool you wrote can be used directly from velocity and is perfectly safe then you can simple have one method which return it as it is  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i'm not sure I understand your use case exactly  \n15:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why would you have several implementations ?  \n15:04\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, $services.ObjectSort.sort(XWikiObject, List of properties)  \n15:04\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, I don't know if I'll want to have several implementations.  \n15:05\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, Who knows?  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see what this have to do with script services  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you could register another script service or have differents methods in your script service  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a script service is just a bridge to set script macro call some java methods  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then you do whatever you want in it  \n15:06\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, Maybe a script service should just contain a factory method for each implementation.  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it depends of your use case  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you want a factory in your script service then you can add it  \n15:08\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0ok  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a script service is just an entry point, there is no rule of what method it should have, you don't even have to make it singleton  \n15:08\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, By the way, the documentation for $services.query is confusing.  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which part ?  \n15:09\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0By referring to the documentation, one can't know if $services.query.xqwl(\"XWQL query\") is possible.  \n15:09\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0.xqwl is not defined.  \n15:09\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0.hql, too  \n15:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:10\u00a0<crocket>\u00a0tmortagne, I mean http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/SRD/Navigation?xpage=embed  \n15:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean you don't have any $services.query.xqwl method in your wiki ?
