We'd need to make that visible in the UI. FTR Ludovic got hit by a delete issue yesterday and couldn't figure out how to find the reason and he had to ask for my help.  \n09:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Hi vmassol  \n09:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I can't find one, and I don't remember creating one  \n09:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0wait  \n09:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0found  \n09:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13052  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0haha and I raised it ;)  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n09:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yw  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BFD day!  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks Alex for sending the mail  \n09:40\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:41\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0Hello!  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi  \n09:47\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Good morning, here my silly question today:  \n09:47\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0In other word: create a new page with MyNewDoc?parent=MyTemplate is equivalent to copy MyTemplate to MyNewDoc? Thxs  \n09:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: yes it's equivalent AFAIK  \n09:51\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok. cool thxs :)  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only diff is that when you edit with template  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then the user is presented with the new page not saved yet  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can make content modificaiton and then save  \n09:53\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok my idea was to copy template, make some modif, save and go in edit mode for user ty  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:13\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0is now known as <lkrejci-brb>  \n10:22\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0has quit  \n10:22\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:22\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0is now known as <Signum>  \n10:36\u00a0<lkrejci-brb>\u00a0is now known as <lkrejci>  \n10:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:52\u00a0<oorezz>\u00a0has quit  \n12:52\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:56\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: hi  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how are you?  \n13:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pinging you privately  \n13:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hi vmassol ! \u00a0\u00a0... somewhat busy, but ok. how are you ?  \n13:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok  \n14:33\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:34\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:34\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:34\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n15:04\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:04\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n15:04\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n15:34\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n16:34\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:39\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n16:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:21\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: hi  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: cool that you fixed this one :)  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0CopyOnWriteArrayList never used this one!  \n18:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it was not very common  \n18:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I never saw this issue actually but it should not happen anymore  \n18:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0first time I use it also  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw sorry guys for not participating to BFD, I feel bad about this...  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but been really busy in various meetings again...  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I skipped a few BFD myself some time ago, getting back on track :)  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n18:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0Hi. I upgraded XWiki from 7.1.2 to 7.1.4 and then to 7.4.2. When on 7.4.2, the LDAP identification is not working for existing users. When trying with a new user, the connection succeeds. Do you have any clue on where to look for issues ?  \n18:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fcharton: you should enabled debug log and see what you get, see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication#HEnableLDAPdebuglog  \n18:48\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0thanks tmortagne , I'll have a look  \n18:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0Seems to be related to the fact that the mail field has multiple values in LDAP. Causes Illegal casting exception from ArrayList to String.  \n19:03\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:09\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: Hi  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Hi sdumitriu, I've pinged you on skype.
