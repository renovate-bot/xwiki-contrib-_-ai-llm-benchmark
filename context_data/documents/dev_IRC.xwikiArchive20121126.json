I committed a TestRule that logs some debugging info and it works fine for ui-tests (I can see the [INFO] logs in the console) but it doesn't for the extension-tests. The rule is executed, because it also takes a screenshot on failure, and I can see the screenshot in the target dir.  \n09:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I tried to copy the logback.xml from src/test/resource of ui-tests to extension-tests but no change  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: it depends which logs, the log you see in EM UI are grabbed to not pollute the log file  \n09:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but logs are not disabled ingeneral during the integrations test AFAIK  \n09:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0they are for ui-tests, because of the custom logback.xml file I guess  \n09:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I did not do anything special for logs myself  \n09:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0My test rule uses the standard logger, and logs with INFO level. In ui-tests I can see in the console my messages  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AFAIK extension-tests is a customized XE, there is nothing really special on test side  \n09:47\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking something  \n09:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think I know  \n09:49\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in the pom of ui-test the maven-surefire-plugin is configured to use the custom logback.xml file  \n09:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0let me do the same in extension-tests  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n09:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I duplicated ui-test when I created extension-tests but I guess this conf is more recent  \n09:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0probably yes  \n09:51\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n09:51\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne1: it works, committing  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0mflorea: ok  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0has quit  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0Hi, is there a way to use a macro for generating a toc for a tree within a space ?  \n10:27\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0anyone here at all ?  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Hi zykes-  \n10:29\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you checked on extensions.xwiki.org  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome#|t=extensions&p=1&l=30&s=doc.creationDate&d=desc&summary=tree  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(search for \"tree\" in the summary column)  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne1>\u00a0has quit  \n10:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:33\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0ok!  \n10:34\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0is there any guide on setting up caching / nginx or so with xwiki ?  \n10:34\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0I want to use nginx to ssl proxy to xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think so  \n10:34\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0I  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0zykes-: you should try google before asking :)  \n10:34\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0vmassol: done that  \n10:35\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0and got it partially working  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's teh first link  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/NginX  \n10:35\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0doesn't that mean you would need to host your xwiki at / on tomcat ?  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't ask me  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I almost don't even know what nginx is :)  \n10:36\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0ah, what do you use then vmassol ?  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0zykes-: nothing\u2026. or just tomcat or apache/tomcat  \n10:37\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0ah  \n10:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0You don't need to host it at the root if you're using a proxy. You can use mod\\_rewrite (I assume nginx accepts apache mods) to add in the /xwiki/ directory so your users don't see it.  \n10:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm not familiar with nginx but I am with lighttpd.  \n10:39\u00a0<zykes->\u00a0All my stuff works currently except that the some links generated by xwiki ends up being http:// instead of https://  \n10:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0did you change the xwiki.conf file to output https links?

I have reduced to do it only once, in a single place for now. We may decide not to do it if the database is up to date, but this will be a design change requiring also to put a mechanism to change the database version when we want to trigger an update while only the .hbm are changed.  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed, we were doing it, there was no messages though so for the user there was no problem trying to understand the message :)  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do we need the message btw?  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't say much anyway  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be left as debug  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: hmmm is there a reason why in push\\_ow2 the majority of files are commented out :)  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks like a leftover  \n19:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Since now I may do 3 different schema updates, I had the feeling that having them clearly shown would helps, in particular when someone ask on the mailing list what happen, know where it happen helps. Only showing the liquibase ones was misleading IMO  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah those files are not under git  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(on maven.xwiki.org)  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they should be  \n19:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-dev-tools/blob/master/xwiki-release-scripts/push-release.sh#L275 ?  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: it's ok in git  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the local copy that's not correct  \n19:10\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0someone has commented out most of the lines  \n19:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0maybe the previous RM commented out files as they were successfully uploaded  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we should have it under git and do some git reset  \n19:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0because the SSH timeout is very small and you can lose the connection quicly  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but I had to discover it  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after my uploads were done  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the ones that went through)  \n19:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0you mean you`ve uploaded just some of the artefacts?  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's ok, it's just I was lucky to notice it :)  \n19:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: I propose to remove \"Updating database schema:\" and to keep \"[schema] - Checking Hibernate mapping and updating schema if needed\". Is that ok for you ?  \n19:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yep, we should also give a gray ball to the previous RM for not cleaning up :)  \n19:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Enygma`: not sure we should rely on the previous to clean up, it would be better that the current EM checks its scripts are up to date and unpatched  \n19:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, we have that as a step actually  \n19:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: even better if it's the script that does that  \n19:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we need it under git first  \n19:20\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0don`t know why vmassol has problems.
