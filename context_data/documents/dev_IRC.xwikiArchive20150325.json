Do we use that somewhere already?  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's a narrow use case)  \n15:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0someone might  \n15:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0disabling it would break things  \n15:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but breaking the backward compat for 2 persons in the world could be acceptable  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0while not using output=false when you don't want your macro to display anything is not really a good practice  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could even leave the current behavior for XDOM  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes i agree that output=false is the best  \n15:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's going to break a lot of places  \n15:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not so sure about that  \n15:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it will break things, but many I'm not sure  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm curious to see if it breaks the blog app for example  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0probably not actually  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it probably uses output=false  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'm mentioning the blog app becuase it has a lot of velocity scripting)  \n15:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm -1 to disable XDOM/Block support all of a sudden in any case  \n15:03\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so leave my stuff and document the new behavior and that you need to use output=false  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?
