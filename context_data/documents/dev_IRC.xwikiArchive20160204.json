 \n09:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean because you are going to move the documentation to exo ?  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because I crated the new page using import  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*created  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I can't merge the history  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'm copying the content  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I could do an include and change the content a bit  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not very nice  \n09:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then delete the page you just created and or copy http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/WebDAV#Attachments to exo instead  \n09:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*move or copy  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but it's a lot of work for not much  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd rather do an include if you think it's important to keep the content  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*history  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't have to delete the old page  \n09:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can simply empty it and link to the new doc  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes ok I can do a redirect  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good idea  \n09:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: \"if you think it's important to keep the content\" you're the one complaining about the history lost :)  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know, I'm not sure  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway the redirect works  \n09:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0haha merge conflict :)  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a small one...  \n09:47\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has quit  \n09:50\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: only issue is that the doc says it's not bundled by default, etc which isn't true for 7.4 but ok...  \n10:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the doc is not versionned, it's the same issue for the whole xwiki.org  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure bit users will see download/install 7.4 with wrong doc  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is not the case for other parts  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's probably acceptable  \n10:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now 8.0 is not released so logically you should indicate that webdav is embedded  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I had forgotten we had https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/master/xwiki-platform-tools/xwiki-platform-tool-foxwiki ;)  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: that's my point  \n10:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm not going to redo the doc so I'll leave it like this  \n10:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re foxwiki we should check if it still works...  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0eve if it works you can't install it I think  \n10:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since you need to regularly update the supported versions tag  \n10:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway since the skin changed a lot since the last time foxwiki was touched there is not much change it's working  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: according to jenkins tests are broken since https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/0f8c3308bf34a37057ed840086d4e4f4f6463da2  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but did not digged much more yet  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I've pushed another commit after  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since this one was wrong  \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there has been another build after that but not better  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying to force XE rebuild  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0started a XE build, we'll se  \n10:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you sure you cherry-picked the fix ?  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0master is not failing but 7.4 is  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0forget that master is failing  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0since both master and 7.4 are failing I doubt it's a timing issue  \n10:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe the fix was not enough or the test are expecting to find some now remove javascript variable or something  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it shouldn't change anything normally for firefox  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've merged correctly on the 7.4.x branch, just checked  \n10:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I checked and it's the only thing that has been committed on 7.4 yesterday so it's definitely the cause but need to find why now  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking locally  \n10:23\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0TBH I tested my first fix  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which was not causing any problem  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it was wrong so I fixed it  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but didn't recheck the fix  \n10:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cehcking now  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually that's not true, I did rechek it  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking again  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works locally  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now checking one of the failing test  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like a critical peace of most AWM test has been broken  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it could not set some configuration  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like saving takes forever for some reason and the wait condition fail with a timeout  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you have a link to a failing test I can debug locally.  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can pick one in http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-7.4.x/lastBuild/testReport/  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they all seems to fail for more or less the same reason  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but looks like a distant side effect  \n10:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so it's not clear for me what is the actually reason, the effect is that save takes too long  \n10:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but only with AWM  \n10:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe mflorea have an idea or already saw this in the past  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can rperoduce locally  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the step2 of AWM which takes forever  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it says \"Saving\u2026 0%\"  \n10:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n10:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0seems related to the actionButtons.js change  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I'm debugging locally  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the change works fine  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0var isCustomForm = (this.form.action.indexOf(\"/preview/\") >= 0);  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0returns false as it should  \n10:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0should be true for AWM  \n10:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it has a custom form  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no preview  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the url  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the url I have is: \"http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/edit/test/Code/testClass?wizard=true&editor\u2026mplate=AppWithinMinutes.ClassTemplate&parent=test.WebHome&title=test+Class\"  \n10:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's the other way around  \n10:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0custom form = no preview  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0before we had = contains(\"/preview\")  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so contains would return true if /preview/ was there  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I haven't changed that  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm maybe there was a not I missed  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my bad  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there was a not  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's funny  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that where were 3 checking this line when I made the change  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at my computer desk)  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I asked for confirmaztion  \n10:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the kind of think nobody ever see and why we need automated tests :)  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and of course on my manual test with the admin save button it was working fine\u2026  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be ok now  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FWIW I got the following console errors locally, related to solr: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/60f93a54e5289e50d529/raw/27bd08f61e653b17fe41a2a6b290b8783cb79304/gistfile1.txt  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0loadXWikiDoc returning null apparently  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could have happened while I was stopping xwiki though  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still not very nice  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Note: I have contacted by email the guy who started http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Redmine+Issues+Macro to ask him what were his plans.  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0waiting one more day before removing it  \n10:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm we're missing documentation about our Events in xwiki  \n11:05\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0sdumitriu: hi Sergiu - do you still have work to do for XWIKI-12947 and XCOMMONS-905 ?

 \n14:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n14:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:32\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: They're still in place, just deprecated, and Clirr is still complaining about them (no binary compatibility)  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: hmm I don't see any clirr exclude in platform-core  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops that's commons  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found them so it means backward comapt is broken  \n15:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's not often that users implement uberspectors so that could be acceptable  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however in this case, we could also decide to completely remove the classes instead of deprecating them  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since backward compat is broken anyway)  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah one point though  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0users can have configured velocity uberspectors in their xwiki.properties  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does that continue to work? (did you test that use case?)  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so maybe:  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- users of existing uberspectors provided by XWiki are not broken, even when using the old velocity configuration for uberspectors  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- implementers of uberspectors will need to have their code recompiled against xwiki 8.0 (ie backward compat broken)  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that correct?  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: as far as I understand the old configuration does not work anymore, you can to change it when you upgrade  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/can to/have to/  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm that would be bad  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I'll have to check this  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's less bad for configuration than API and it's 8.0 but yes not so nice  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can be sure that people will forget to update their config file  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0needs to be documented in the RN at least  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me see what error they get  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if thi sis true  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it wasn't my understanding)  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think they will not get any error, simply it won't be taken into account  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if they only modified runtime.introspector.uberspect.chainClasses  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm checking the typical use case of people who have removed the deprecatd uberspector  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(a typical use case that is even documented on xwiki.org)  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/How+to+avoid+deprecated+messages+in+the+logs  \n15:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes runtime.introspector.uberspect.chainClasses  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I understand is that this property simply don't exist anymore from velocity point of view so unless velocity log error for unknown properties you won't know that it's not taken into account anymore  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing one more thing...  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now you will quickly see that you have deprecated API warning in the log :)  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that's an indication :D  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what worries me a lot more  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that you won't hae the secure uberspector nor the methodargument one  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that's an issue  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why ?  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those are enabled by default  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because they'll be ignored  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is ignored in your customization  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not if you have configured the uberspectors  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you get the default uberspectors  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have configured property that does not exist  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so nobody cares  \n15:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's like commented stuff basically  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes ok I get it  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should be ok  \n15:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still checking  \n15:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok good  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: you have forgotten to update xwiki.properties.vm it seems  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fixing  \n16:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n16:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I saw a commit from sdumitriu updating it  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don'(t have it locally  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I don't see it in the commit tab  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/cc0ce74acc684d4b2af317fb4b9928f9bbca5265  \n16:08\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah my bad  \n16:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the reason why the issue was still open  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I git pulled commons  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of platform  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's not in the issue's commit tab though...  \n16:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I found that weird  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he's using [Misc]  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why  \n16:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right  \n16:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0did not checked  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too bad...  \n16:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n16:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think we need a simpler option to enable/disabled logs which does not require to know so much about Velocity behavior  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*debug log  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need a wiki console ASAP  \n16:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(and is less fragile and could be used for other purpose than Velocity)  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to have the logs of page rendering in the wiki  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at each page level)  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[7.4.1] http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui-7.4.x/60/testReport/ looks like a real thing  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0AWM again  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but only one this time  \n16:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like a test have a syntax error in a XPATH  \n16:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"SyntaxError: The expression is not a legal expression.\" with //td[contains(@class, 'doc\\_space')]/a[. = 'WizardTest \u00bb testCreateApplication \u00bb fZ;''`,UeWP\u00e2']  \n16:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol, mflorea: right a bell ?

I'm using a random string to test that you can put anything in the name of an app created with AWM so this can break some of the XPaths we use in tests because we don't properly escape  \n16:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I fixed some of the XPath but there are a few remaining  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd suggest to avoid random test inputs  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it did help me discover some characters that were causing issues  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's actually nice to have random inputs but those tests need to be in a different category  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I agree there are some nice effects  \n16:31\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Hi guys, shouldn't we put a comment on this page http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/HTML+To+Wiki+Converter+Extension, in order to avoid user to think that you need perl to convert HTML to XWiki ?
