I have a question regarding methods' deprecation in Java. Let's say I have methodA(String, String) and I figure out that 1 parameter is useless, then I will create methodA(String) and deprecate the first one. Q: Should I replace all the content with a call to the second one, or should I let it as it is?  \n16:47\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0I saw a lot of examples where the deprecated method contains just a call to the new one, but I saw also one example where the code is not changed when the method is deprecated.  \n17:15\u00a0<OSIMasson2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:16\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:43\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0acotiuga: depends what is the difference between the two method  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what is important is that methodA(String, String) does not change  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then no duplication when possible is just common sense  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/does not change/behavior does not change/  \n17:48\u00a0<ImRG>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<raphael29\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:30\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n18:33\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:44\u00a0<Shubham\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:45\u00a0<Shubham\\_>\u00a0I am looking foward to participate in GSOC & would like to know how to start with xkiwi ?  \n19:46\u00a0<Shubham\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0that was fast :) if you still need GSOC details come back :P  \n20:58\u00a0<OSIMasson2>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:08\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:47\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:35\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has quit  \n23:41\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit\n"}
