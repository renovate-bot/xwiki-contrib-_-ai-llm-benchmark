Admin rights of the subwiki can be set in that subwiki (change user display to \"global users\")  \n13:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: actually both, and was wondering where specifically, do i assign a user to a group or can i give a user special rights?  \n13:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can give a user special rights, if needed. I prefer to put users into groups, whenever possible, however - less special rules  \n13:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there are no programming rights in a subwiki. the reason for this is that it makes little sense. Someone who has the \"programing\" right implicitly has read/write access everywhere  \n13:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0\"impliciely\" because all she/he has to do is write a script, because access rights are not checked inside scripts  \n13:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: thanks you.  \n13:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0(loosely speaking) - actually right are checked as normal when using the \"normal\" API, but users with programming rights can access he \"below script API\" objects, so to say  \n13:34\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0another question, do you know a guide / manual which describes how to do proper backups ?  \n13:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0one moment  \n13:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is on xwiki.org in the admin guide in any case  \n13:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Backup  \n13:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0can be found vie \"xwiki.org\" > \"Documentation\" ->\"The Administrator's Guide \"  \n13:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0great thanks so much!  \n13:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0will set it up right away :)  \n13:44\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0anyone knowns about the current state of the CK Editor integration? \u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/CKEditor+Integration  \n13:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ClemensR: should be finished by the end of the year.  \n13:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0currently is a bit on hold, since we are working on NS/ND.  \n13:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0evalica: cool, thanks! give me a heads up when it is ready for beta testing!  \n13:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, nested spaces first, I noticed :)  \n13:58\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k :)  \n14:06\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: i try to use DocumentTree with 7.0.1 and instead i get the followoing output  \n14:25\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0documentTree  \n14:25\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0(% class='xtree ' data-responsive=\"true\" data-url='/xwiki/wiki/lcsbbiocore/get/XWiki/DocumentTree?outputSyntax=plain&showTranslations=false&showAttachments=false&showChildDocuments=false' data-root='' data-dragAndDrop='false' data-contextMenu='false' data-icons='false' data-edges='false' data-checkboxes='false' data-openTo='' data-finder='false' %)((()))  \n14:25\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0any idea, what could be the issue?  \n14:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0where do you use it? is this the panel or a macro ?  \n14:25\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: it's a macro in a document  \n14:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it looks like the wiki-syntax got escaped / is not executed  \n14:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0this can happen if you add it inside an {{html}}-macro with wiki=\"false\" , for example  \n14:28\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: ah sorry, it's actually the gadget in the Dashboard  \n14:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, let me check  \n14:41\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: oki thank you  \n14:42\u00a0\\*\u00a0ClemensR distracted, takes a moment  \n14:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Trefex: works with 7.1.1 ... now finding some 7.01. instance ...  \n14:49\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: ok, we might upgrade to 7.1.1 as well today, can it be done seamlessly?  \n14:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can check the release notes for gotchas: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki711 \u00a0(and http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki71 )  \n14:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0as far as I remember there are no update issues for 7.1.1 (the one for 7.1 is fixed)  \n14:53\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: I use this now as backup script. https://paste.fedoraproject.org/253389/43921117/ Do you see anything I might have forgotten ?  \n14:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0did you post your DB passwd on that page? 8-|  \n14:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: yep, lol, ah well  \n14:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0the pastie will be gone in 1 month  \n14:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0and the VM is internal  \n14:55\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so \u2026 n00b mistake :S  \n14:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, well you can always change the passwd  \n14:57\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0so to upgrade using debian packages, i just do apt-get upgrade and then restart the wiki?  \n14:58\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0are there any upgrade instructions? I couldn't find any  \n14:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I do not see anything, bu the proof of the pudding is in the eating, I mean in the restore  \n14:59\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0upgrade instructions in the admin guide: \u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/ \u00a0\u00a0second section  \n15:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is a bit outdated, \u00a0I see - what you need to do is to run the apt-get update/upgrade - which should restart the tomcat, and then log in via the web to the main wiki, and follow the distribution wizard throught the update process  \n15:01\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ClemensR: that page is not applicable for debian packages  \n15:01\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0yeap ok, so straightforward, starting a backup, testing, and then i report back :D  \n15:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0oh, and if you have subwikis, you migth want to backup all databases in the backup script  \n15:01\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i do don't i ?  \n15:02\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I didnt see it ... maybe I overlooked  \n15:02\u00a0<Trefex> 1. mysqldump --add-drop-database -u xwiki --password=xxx --all-databases > db/xwiki.sql  \n15:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, yes, you do, my memory tripped over the -u xwiki - remembered it as -d xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0so all is well, I should have had a second look before typing :)  \n15:04\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0no no, you're very helpful, don't expect you to remember everything :)  \n15:14\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:21\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0anyone knows where I can see a btn-danger in the UI ? (Oh, and maybe this should be shown when deleting a wiki ;) )  \n15:24\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ClemensR: theoretically in the initial form standard we only had primary and secondary actions, so we don't use that often the danger style of buttons. Maybe you will find it in delete, but I'm not sure if we should use it, since it's very strong (red).  \n15:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0although bootstrap is providing it  \n15:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, so it is there because bootstrap provides it :) \u00a0- the delete button is still an div.buttonwrapper>input.button \u00a0I guess that is a \"migration to be done\" ;)  \n15:59\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<\\_cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n16:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:22\u00a0<Ramona2>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:56\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:10\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:50\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:22\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:24\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:32\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:49\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:50\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:50\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0Hi, I am facing a weird issue when I upload an attachment in a page the images are not shown in the page  \n21:51\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0and when I select the image it shows \"The attachment does not exist.\"  \n21:51\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0I am sing \u00a07.2 milestone 1  \n21:51\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0\\*using  \n22:20\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0has quit  \n22:20\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
