 \n18:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, jep, likely a bit old  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in 8.3 we added an HTTPS repo  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0extension repo that is  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we made a mistake in 8.3 for old java 8 versions  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which we fixed only after  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie for 8.3.1 and 8.4  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe you're hitting this problem  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checkign if we mentioned it in the R  \n18:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0RN  \n18:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yup, it is 1.8.0\\_77 \u00a0...  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need 101 I think  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(min)  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or use a more recent build  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's mentioned here: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/Data/XWiki/8.3/  \n18:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, forgot the release notes, thats why, should have thought about that  \n18:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I see it just now ... updating ...  \n18:49\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0looks like the \"Improved Not Found Screen\" is a duplicate in the RN ;)  \n19:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, no it is not, it is just an improvement of another another also added in 8.4 ...  \n19:06\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0darn, the macro is not visible in the wysiwyg editor, makes it hard to do screenshots  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm sounds like sometihng to fix  \n19:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wysiwyg should be \u2026 wysiwyg\u2026 :)  \n19:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yeah, and as the macro does nothing visible by itself, only include styles .... it is not visible in the editor  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least you could show the syntax/uage of the macro  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+ a screenshot in view mode  \n19:08\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yep, that is easier (except for the typos in the description, I see now ... never mind :D )  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: that's because the wysisyg controls the css/js it loads I think \u00a0btu that's a problem that we need to fix IMO  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have a similar issue with LT I think  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually not exactly the same  \n19:09\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if a macro does nothing, just showing a cog icon to \u00a0open it would be nice  \n19:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess I just cannot focus on it to open the macro editor  \n19:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0never mind I just add a new one, snapshot the edit step and the result  \n19:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, must be good enough for today ... more fixes tomorrow if needed  \n19:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n20:44\u00a0<dmd->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:45\u00a0<dmd->\u00a0when PUTting a new page via REST, how can I include a link like [[foo>>http://example.com]]?
