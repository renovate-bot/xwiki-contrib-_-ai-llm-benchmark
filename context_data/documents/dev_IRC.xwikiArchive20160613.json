Sounds like a clean way to proceed.  \n08:54\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Thanks  \n08:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR there are plenty of examples  \n08:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's easy to do  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even a tutorial started here: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/UIXTutorial  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0some examples of existing uixp:http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ExtensionPoint/  \n08:56\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Any reason the tutorial is not mentioned from UIExtension+Module ?  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no good reason, you think you could ad it?  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n08:56\u00a0<polx>\u00a0I know I can, but I\u2019ll need to read first.  \n09:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Oh, and another question: what\u2019s the modern way to integrate a tool to produce standalone html within an extension? I know of a way to do it using xpage=plain but maybe defining a new \u201caction\u201d or even servlet is cleaner? Seems to me that hte first is the easiest.  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean introduce a new URL/action?  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if so that would be http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Resource+API )  \n09:05\u00a0<polx>\u00a0A new action is a new URL indeed.  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0example: webjar module  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in platform)  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll find a ResourceReferenceHandler impl there  \n09:06\u00a0<polx>\u00a0So that\u2019s the new action way. Isn\u2019t that overcrowded?  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's supposed to replace the old XWikiAction way  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so new actions we write use those while we still need to move the old ones to it  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what you mean by overcrowded  \n09:07\u00a0<polx>\u00a0since there\u2019s no namespacing\u2026  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's namespacing  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course :)  \n09:09\u00a0<polx>\u00a0If you use /xwiki/bin/view/MyApp/LaunchEditor you have namespacing.  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the <type> in http://.../xwiki/<type>/<dependent on the type>  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and <type> happens to be the hint of your ResourceReferenceHandler component impl  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in the standard URL scheme)  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n09:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: good mornin  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0morning  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: good morning  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi, just left a comment for you in http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/ANTISPAM-25  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hope you had a good we! :)  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: xwiki is not main wiki  \n09:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wiki:xwiki is  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it used to work so maybe the format has changed  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?

 \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:26\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the Edit menu?  \n15:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I guess it would be an UIExtension, now you are talking about the listing in the content menu + profile settings.  \n15:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0this is the extension point that outputs the wysiwyg editor (be it gwt or ck or another one)  \n15:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0+administration, so there are like 3 places where the editors will be listed / configured  \n15:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: the answer is simple according to the thread I pointed to  \n15:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wysiwyg and editor in general you should be tied to xclasses IMO, they should be components be it UI extension or something else  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so basically you should use UIExtesnionClass (instead of a custom XClass) only if you need only content  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/content/a content field  \n15:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this case and only in this case, you could reuse the UIExtensionClass which is simply a specific XClass that can be used generically for this special use case  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least that's what is at http://markmail.org/message/ewk4rq7p2mtqehto  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and what seems the common agreement so far (Caty, Sergiu, me)  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0UI extension are not just a \"specific xclass\"  \n15:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is one thing xclass are not is component  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ui extension are components which mean you can implement them the way you want, including in a java component  \n15:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the main goal is to output the wysiwyg editor, but we can't know for sure that we won't need some parameters in the future. Do we change from UIExtension to XClass at that point?  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's true for XClass too  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can create them in java  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO WYSIWYG should not be iu extension or XClass  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I already described how I was seing editor component in another mail  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: yes there's always the upgrade issue and in this case it would require a migrator  \n15:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: the wysiwyg editor is UI, it generates HTML, I don't want to generate HTML from Java  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: it's UI but it does not have to be wiki page  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not because it's a component that the implementation is fully in java  \n15:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: we could implement a generic XClass migrator at one point btw  \n15:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0mflorea: this is not a quick poll :) trickery  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: as you know DW steps are component and they are implemented in templates  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I see the same thing for editors  \n15:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: dw is not an extension, it's not installable. the wysiwyg editor needs to be installable  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not change anything  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DW steps are components  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they could come from an extension  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the list of step is harcoded right now that's all  \n15:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0how would the templates be installed?  \n15:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0or do you mean using the templates from the jar?  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0OIDC have several templates, here is how it works:  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* it ask the template manager if there is any template named \"oidc/provider/consent.vm\"  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* if none it execute as template the resource file \"/oidc/provider/consent.vm\" which is the default implementation for this view  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0later we could easily add this fallback to resource file support right in template manager (but I needed to make oidc work on 7.4 anyway so I had to do it on my side for now)  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway the important thing is that component is not an issue for UI, at all  \n15:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it allows implementing it in a lot more way that XClass based extension points  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0simple XClass extension point that is  \n15:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it is, because it's not as easy to make changes at runtime, the dev feedback cycle is longer, same with webjars  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: you skipped the first step  \n15:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I see  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again during development you simple edit templates/oidc/provider/consent.vm  \n15:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's hat I did  \n15:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* wiki component  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like UI extension xclass basically are helpers to make easier to implement UI extension component in a wiki pages  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or wiki macros  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the criteria is usually \"do I want to be able to implement this kind of component without PR\"  \n15:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: what about the scope that the UI extensions have, atm we can't install a component (with EM) in the user namespace  \n15:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I mean from the UI  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean allow any user to install an extension (not just admin) and in its own namespace ?  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure we could do that, it's not very complex  \n15:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I mean: an user might want to integrate another editor but without affecting the other users  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is not the same thing  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I explain how to configure editors in my mail  \n15:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the issue is that the editor will be visible for others (in the list of editors to chooe from)  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://markmail.org/message/fxyeraknkcpbcgfg  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0here is the mail  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think making possible for only one user to see a WYSIWYG you installed  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is a real use case  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0an admin install a new WYSIWYG, if you want to select it as your default WYSIWYG (or the admin indicate it's the default one from now on)  \n15:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not talking about admin. An user wants to use some editor that he likes an for which there isn't any extension availble. He want to integrate it. He should be able to do this very easily  \n15:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it should be possible from the wiki, without jave  \n15:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you are talking about install an extension without admin right  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure why you are talking about java here  \n15:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0not install, integrate some third party editor  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I already said you don't need to implement it in Java, you can implement it in Java  \n15:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0like for instance I want to use a different date picker  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the editor you are talking about has to come from somewhere  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0either it's already installed and you can select it in a list or it's not installed  \n15:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0i.e. I want to customize my instance and I want to change the wysiwyg editor  \n15:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's not installed, I want to integrate it  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what means \"integrate\" ?  \n15:54\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it means I want to use it instead of the default editor  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does it exist somewhere ? you say it's not installed but you want to magically \"integrate\" it so I don't understand what is it  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for me as soon as you install an extension that contains an editor it become available in a list in which you can select it  \n15:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it exists somewhere on the web, it's some JavaScript+CSS files that I can load from some CDN or that I can copy to my instance or put in some JSX/SSX  \n15:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends on the kind of editor, etc.. (but would probably be more clear if you read the example I listed in my mail :))  \n15:57\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for instance I want to use this editor https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor  \n15:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not an admin and I want to use this editor instead of the default provided WYSIWYG editor  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are mixing several things here I think, a complete editor is handling some data, but then this editor could allow you to choose between several themes. For example the date editor you installed might allow you to choose between several calendar view or indicate another one  \n15:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not all or nothing, you need to organize things in abstraction levels  \n16:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing  \n16:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0when I download XWiki and edit some wiki page I get a wysiwyg editor. I, as a non-admin user, want to replace that editor, I want to use some other editor, like https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor . First step is to check for existing XWiki extensions.  \n16:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I can't find anyone that integrates https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor so I would like to integrate it myself  \n16:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but from the wiki, at runtime, without using Java  \n16:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you cannot just use it as it is, you need to build plumbing around it for it to properly talk with XWiki  \n16:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, but where would I put that plumbing?  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you are not a user, you are a developer writing a new editor ?  \n16:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not a real developer, I just read the https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs and I see that I can use this editor with the help of some HTML/JS. Where can I put this HTML/JS so that I can replace the current wysiwyg editor  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if your question is how do I provide an editor component in a XAR extension then I answered this with:  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(03:43:37 PM) tmortagne: or wiki macros  \n16:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, so wiki component is the answer  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so from this I guess the answer will be: you create a page with object EditorClass configured to be associated with WYSIWYG  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0wiki component is the answer we already have  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but we can make it simpler  \n16:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like we don't force people to write wiki component to provide wiki macros  \n16:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the important things for me is that the root of the editor extension point is a component role  \n16:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then from it we can build as many helpers as we want  \n16:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0regarding this component role, and what you proposed on the mail, I'm not sure how Editor<String> would work. Imagine that there is an editor for CSS and one for JavaScript (just an example). We would need to add some CSS and JavaScript type so that we can use Editor<CSS> and Editor<JavaScript>  \n16:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is several choices  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* Editor<String> with @Named(\"<mimetype>\")  \n16:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\* probably other possibilities  \n16:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n17:10\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:11\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0hello, I've just found out this: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wiki.xwiki.user/28977  \n17:11\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0is there an alternative solution without using Velocity?  \n17:11\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0(our enterprise xwiki installation has velocity macros disabled)  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:22\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_0>\u00a0in other words, what would be the equivalent of $doc.documentReference as a node identifier?
