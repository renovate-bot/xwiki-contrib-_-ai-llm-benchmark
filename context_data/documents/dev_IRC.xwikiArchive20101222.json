 \n09:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it's good but i think you can improve it by doing as little as putting the panels on the left side  \n09:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0improve xwiki.org, that is  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: there's a reason for the panels on the right  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was to put content as the first class citizen  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we had an ergonomist work on that  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and advise us  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:56\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, that is a very valid argument  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I also didn't like it initially  \n09:57\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i personally prefere navigation first  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was agasint it  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I got used to it now but I agree that the first impression is strange since we're used to seeing menus on th e left  \n09:57\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, ergonomists have weird ideas. i should know, i took those classes in the last two semesters in university ;)  \n09:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, not exactly strange. it's not like it stops anyone. it's just that i personally like to have navigation first and if i want the content i proceed to the next bit of the page  \n09:59\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0how about the proposal mockup, did you work with said ergonomist on that, too?  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that proposal was done by evalica  \n10:00\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i see  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and discussed on the list  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well the other way around, discussed led to it  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/discussed/discussion/  \n10:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0:)  \n10:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0the only thing i really don't like is on the first screenshot the huge link collection  \n10:01\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like that's too much for me to make ony sense of it without having to read it all or use ctrl + f  \n10:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I really like the feature that you don't have to attach images on all pages  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sabageru: good monring  \n10:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and you can reffer them  \n10:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0very cool stuff  \n10:02\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0vmassol: good morning  \n10:02\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sburjan: agreed! also keeps the database smaller!  \n10:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yepp  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sabageru: I think there's a pb with activity stream on xwiki.org and I thought I raised an issue but can't find it  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sabageru: for ex if you go to http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/MaximeSinclair you'll see it's missing activity for stuff he did on subwikis  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he's just modified a page on the extensions wiki a few minutes ago for ex and he's done a lot of changes yesterday  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think the combination of several params in the activity macro could be causing that  \n10:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me get you the call  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{activity authors=\"${doc.fullName}\" wikis=\"xwiki,platform,enterprise,manager,extensions,dev,watch,xeclipse,xoffice,contrib\" /}}  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could it be possible that the combination of authors and wikis fail somehow to take into account the specified wikis?  \n10:04\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0the wikis seem to be correct ...  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check my profile  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's it  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when you use authors it \"forgets\" the wikis param  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was pretty sure I created a jira issue for this  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looking for it again  \n10:06\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0anyway, as you say, the issue is the fact that using authors param makes the macro forget the wikis param ?  \n10:06\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0i could look into this one :)  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think so  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks, it should be quite easy to fix I guess  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found it  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-760  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(sabageru)  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah raluca gave a comment but not a solution  \n10:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well she did give a solution  \n10:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm website survey is not available anymore but it's still linked  \n10:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0you might want to change either the availability or the link on the front page...  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Survey works for me  \n10:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i get \"oops something went frong  \n10:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0do i need to be logged in?  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah maybe didn't try this  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0works too when not logged  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when does it fail jstoldt?  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after you fill the survey or before?  \n10:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0well, clicked it filled it, sent it, failed  \n10:10\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so upon hitting submit it fails  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah ok didn't try that part  \n10:10\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0vmassol : as far as i remember, i did this modification for Raluca but i think it didn;t get commited on SVN. i will send an email to sdumitriu with a patch for this  \n10:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0saiys the form is no longer active  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sabageru: ok great thanks  \n10:11\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0welcome :)  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: ok I'll ask the person who set it up  \n10:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cool  \n10:11\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:13\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:18\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0g'mornin folks. Right hand menu vs. left hand reminds me of the big endians and the little endians.  \n10:19\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Unfortunately to change now would break the use flow for people who are experienced with it.  \n10:20\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0That is one of my complaints with MICROS~1 every new version of windows requires learning a completely different interface.  \n10:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0vmassol: remember about the XARDiff app we discussed yesterday? well, just downloaded the standalone zip, logged on as Admin, imported xardiff, granted Admin group programming rights and clicked on the xardiff space... still getting velocity errors and some logging about a JVM BUG  \n10:21\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0cjdelisle: well, i don't think it really needs that much learning in the case of microsoft. however, you are right, it breaks the users expectations and that makes him a little quirky until he gets the hang of it  \n10:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so from a usability point of view it's a little tricky... breaking new users expectations because they expect left menu, i think or breaking older users expectations who expect right menu  \n10:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Big arrow at the top which moves it back over?  \n10:23\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0^and saves in user profie  \n10:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0to be honest with you, i don't even know if you should bother at all...  \n10:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0like i said, it's not like it actually breaks anything and the reasoning the ergonomist gave you is very sound  \n10:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so if it comes down to priorities and you say content is top priority you are better off the way you are now  \n10:24\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Mouse moves right, nothing there, bad feeling. Bad feelings don't explain themselves nor conform to logic.  \n10:24\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, it's really all about what you expect and what you know  \n10:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0Be Apple, define the user's expectations.  \n10:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i think most websites use left menu, thus new users expect the menus on the left. but users who've been around expect it to be right  \n10:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0so no matter what someone will have to addapt  \n10:25\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0lol, i'd rather not be apple  \n10:25\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0They are very good at what they do.  \n10:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but you are right, one of my teachers actually said they have a good design from a usability POV  \n10:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0but i would not go as far as call them revolutionairies...  \n10:27\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not praising them, I think it's overpriced tethered equipment. However their marketing is genius.  \n10:27\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, sure as hell is. apple is 90% about marketing and designing for the hippster non-technical users now  \n10:28\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cjdelisle: do you have experience with Memtest ?  \n10:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0yup  \n10:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0memtest86  \n10:28\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n10:28\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0prv :)  \n10:28\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0run on all new computers  \n10:31\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n10:32\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0who would be the right person to nag about OpenOffice.org import/view stuff?  \n10:44\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:46\u00a0<esdaniel>\u00a0hi... any recommendations on best way to reivew/audit a wiki's user/group permission model (can I export the model?)  \n10:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: If I don't get an answer from tmortagne soon, I'll revert his change  \n10:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0jvelo: We really need to find out what's the problem with the myxwiki server  \n10:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Any luck debugging the stuck mysql connections?  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: re xardiff I don't know.
