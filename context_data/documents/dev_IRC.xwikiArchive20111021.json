I am going to report this  \n11:36\u00a0<Alex\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:37\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:41\u00a0<Alex\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0Hallo everyone. I can't get the LDAP Authentication of the XWiki running. I use the ldap tools from the extension page. \u00a0If i trigger the sync job i get the following error in the log http://pastebin.com/cf03gfXQ. How can I fix this?  \n11:52\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n12:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:18\u00a0<Alex\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n12:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0shouldn't we use the jira macro for http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Roadmap ? it would show better the progress we make (fixed issues are crosslined + we have links to the issues)  \n13:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:27\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n14:30\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:43\u00a0<Alex\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:47\u00a0<Alex\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0Hello again. To my question from [11:41]: I'm now able to sync with LDAP with the username and passwort matching not as the placeholders {0} and {1} but with both typed in directly. Is there any idea what I did wrong and how to use these placeholders?  \n15:11\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n15:17\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has quit  \n15:20\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:39\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:40\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0hi guys, I just noticed that we don't have a page on xwiki.org with a list of all means to contact the community in one place  \n15:41\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0everytime I need to guide people about how to communicate with the community i need to give them 2 links, one to the mailing lists, another one to the IRC and jabber  \n15:41\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it would be great to have it in a single place  \n15:41\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0is there an idea box for the improvement of xwiki.org where I can add this?  \n15:57\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n16:16\u00a0<silviar>\u00a0Hi Anca!

ApplicationResources.properties files?  \n20:24\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0yes  \n20:24\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0the actual java files no problem, i can write such code by hand (must be domain specific anyways)  \n20:24\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0I wonder though if there is a unified mechanism to distill description from wiki page  \n20:25\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:25\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0e.g. what google maps does with wikipedia  \n20:25\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0in gmaps, you can enable wikipedia layer then have icons with balloons filled with \"leader\" or \"introduction\"  \n20:25\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Nothing that I know of, but would be possible with some scripting  \n20:26\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0e.g. there' s no defined way of specifying an intro/leadin for a wiki page?  \n20:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Depends where you want to put the script, in the wiki or as an external service getting the wiki content via REST and the post processing it  \n20:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:26\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0script must run precompiletime in my app  \n20:27\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0so I guess that would be extenral  \n20:32\u00a0<Ruudjah>\u00a0e.g. assume the leadin is untill the first paragraph  \n21:47\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:31\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:51\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has quit  \n23:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:36\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
