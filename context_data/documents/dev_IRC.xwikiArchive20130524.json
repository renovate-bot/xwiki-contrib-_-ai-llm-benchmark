The reason seams to be the HTTP META INFO.

the version of the jar does not seems to match the root jenkins version but not sure if it's just that  \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0other agents seems ok  \n11:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(not sure what as been done for jenkins already and what is planned)  \n11:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and of course looks like all 5.0 test project like agent-2 a lot :)  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I don't understand is that agent-2 does not looks like what's on http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-extension-5.0.x/50/console  \n11:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0putting it offline for now  \n11:54\u00a0<dirk\\_schmitt>\u00a0@tmortagne The Distribution Wizard is a quit new feature - I started an 2.x with xwiki ;-)  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes pretty young feature  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I updated one agent slave, that's agent2  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that's really strange  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's the only one that has a slave jar matching the jenkins version :)  \n11:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that I had seen the exception you noticed on other agents too  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is what prompted me to update the agent  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(agent2)  \n11:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: what is really weird to me is that http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-extension-5.0.x/50/console does not refect what is on agent-2  \n11:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not he same version of the jar for example  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe I need to restart the agent  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think I did  \n11:59\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me try that  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the log say http://ci.xwiki.org/computer/agent-2/log  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Slave.jar version: 2.16  \n12:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not looks like a jenkins version  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok there's a problem  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've discoinetced it and restarted it  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I get: http://ci.xwiki.org/computer/agent-2/log  \n12:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah key issue  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I replaced the ip by the domain name in the conf to make sure it was going to the right server  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's probably why  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok could you put it back?  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I changed all the agents actually since the IP really seems a bad idea IMO  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok then change the ssh known hosts  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me know when you've done it  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cleaning know host file  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0done  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking other agents  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok restarting a2  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0was the only agent with this issue  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok much better now :)  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Slave.jar version: 2.23  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0how is 2.23 better ?  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0betcause it means we're using the correct slave jar now  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0isn't it supposed to be the version of jenkins ?  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure but I'm guessing there's some other internal version too  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm confident  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to update all slave jars now  \n12:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0version of the protocol then maybe  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is why I pinged infra about some automated way yesterday  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in the meantime we could do it manually  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we're several to help it should be ok  \n12:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that most of the other seems to work for now  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I had seen problems with others too  \n12:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway can only be better to have the right version  \n12:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: could you remaing me the wget URL ?

If I download an XE 5.0.1 (jetty+hsqldb). Since \u00a05.0.1 is newer than 5.0, it means it has xwiki.virtual =1 (because this is now the default)  \n16:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0and I correct until this point ?  \n16:37\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0also, in xwiki.cfg comments I see \"#-# Starting with XWiki 5.0M2, virtual mode is enabled by default.\"  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I guess you reached http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Virtualization right?  \n16:39\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, yes. And seeing the section \"Prior to 5.0\", I assume that starting 5.0 is the other way around  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it means you've seen http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Virtualization#HConfigurationpriortoXWiki5.0  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's not clear?  \n16:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I didn't reached yet the unclear part.

I kept missing reading this: \"Note that if no /wiki/wikialias path is found in the URL then XWiki defaults to the domain-based algorithm explained below.\"  \n16:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0shouldn't this be /xwiki/wikialias ?  \n16:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0instead of /wiki/wikialias  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"The URL format for this mode is: http://host/xwiki/wiki/wikialias/view/Space/Page.\"  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"The important part of the URL is /wiki/wikialias.\"  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: so you're good now?  \n17:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol,: just a second settinp up a XEM with WOrkspaces so I can see property the URL  \n17:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0after creating the WOrkspace the DW kicks in, this is something new  \n17:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0is it normal ?  \n17:01\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a05.1-SNAPSHOT  \n17:02\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I cancelled it, and I didn't had to re-import  \n17:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: you mean you created a new workspace which is not empty and you get DW ?  \n17:03\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0DW kicked in and told me that there are some documents in the table and then asked what should I do. I had 2 options: New Install, Upgrade. But I clicked cancel DW :)  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it does not sounds normal but there is no difference between 5.1 and 5.0 on DW AFAIK  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if DW ask you that it's because for some reason it could not find any extension in that workspace  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0let me create another workspace  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seems something has been broken either on standard importer or on copyWiki  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0creating workspace \"thomas\", this didn't exist previously for sure  \n17:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ah wait, it's my bad. I imported the XAR Manually on the Main wiki using superadmin user. I didn't go through DW for installing the Main  \n17:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0maybe this is the cause  \n17:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see why  \n17:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0maybe because EM doesn't have a list of installed extensions/descriptors since I manually imported the ui-all xar  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the only thing you do on main wiki that would have any impact of subwiki DW is choosing if you want DW on subwikis  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: we are talking about a subwiki here  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what you have or don't have on your main wiki is not relevant  \n17:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, I see  \n17:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0makes sense  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and when you import a standard XAR it's registered as extension anyway  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and that' why EM is supposed to find it when workspaces creates it  \n17:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ah also i have a snapshot, but I didn't enabled snapshot repos  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm that would be the reason actually  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when standard import can't find matching on any repository for the XAR it's importing it does not register it as extension  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that's probably your issue here  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it's to avoid putting partial information in the extensions index)  \n17:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne, I see  \n17:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, last question: when using XE jetty+hsqldb, which if the twi configs are user Domain based or path based ?  \n17:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I can't figure that out from the documentation  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"which if the twi configs are user Domain based or path based ?\" == ?  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: what's not clear with \"This is the default mode if you haven't touched the XWiki configuration (xwiki.virtual.usepath property in the xwiki.cfg file).\" ?  \n17:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol, the part where the URL I am redirected when accessing localhost:8080 does NOT contain any \"/wiki/wikialias\"  \n17:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0also, conflicting with \"Note that if no /wiki/wikialias path is found in the URL then XWiki defaults to the domain-based algorithm explained below.\"  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wait  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one thing at a time  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: what's not clear with \"This is the default mode if you haven't touched the XWiki configuration (xwiki.virtual.usepath property in the xwiki.cfg file).\" ?  \n17:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0Ok, the doc says this is the default mode. I assume this is the default mode. And I don't see any \"/wiki/wikialias\" part in my URL  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what's not clear in the doc if that it's actually not really modes  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you always have domain based working and you can enable or disable path based  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: errr?  \n17:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and when path based is enabled it takes priority  \n17:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0so I start wondering. I keep on reading that section until I hit the last line of the section. Which states that if I have NO /wiki/wikialias, the default is domain mode.  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I see  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok changing that  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0said another way enabling path based does not disable domain based  \n17:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(that's why I proposed to separate them in the URL module configuration proposal)  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I keep re-reading the doc and I don't see what's not clear  \n17:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok, let's start again  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in path based it clearly says  \n17:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0This is the default mode if you haven't touched the XWiki configuration (xwiki.virtual.usepath property in the xwiki.cfg file).  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that if not found then it defaults to the domain-based algo  \n17:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/default/goes  \n17:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Note that if no /wiki/wikialias path is found in the URL then XWiki continues to look for a wiki using the domain-based algorithm explained below.\" is it better?
