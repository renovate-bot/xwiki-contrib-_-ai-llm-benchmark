EVER?  \n13:14\u00a0<microblue>\u00a0if someone keep the bug intentionally, and just you meet the bug, what do you feel  \n13:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0you have shit proof anybody kept anything intentionally so you should just refrain from attacking the people who bring you such a huge piece of software  \n13:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0its disgraceful and if i you had attacked me like that i would actually be a lot less friendly than they are  \n13:19\u00a0<microblue>\u00a0if someone made some bugs in an opensource sofeware intentionally, than he is not worth respect.  \n13:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, you are a egomanic prick :)  \n13:20\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0never mind then, there is prolly no helping you  \n13:22\u00a0<microblue>\u00a0is there xwiki developer here?  \n13:23\u00a0<microblue>\u00a0how many developers of xwiki,are they offen come here and talk with users?  \n13:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0microblue: right now there is 5 XWiki core committers and there is usually more but I for one have other thing to do than answer so nice people, I you were kindly asking instead of calling XWiki SAS so kind of scammer I could have told you right away that as far as I remember the filter has been done on purpose a long time ago because some special characters were not well supported behind the scene after the actually upload the attachm  \n13:47\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so no it was not an intentional bug  \n13:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:53\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I would add that out of 5, 2 of the core commiters are not XWiki SAS employees.
