I have the error message when i want to upgrade, repare or delete  \n15:31\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0I use the extension manager  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Antoine\\_\\_\\_: I did this upgrade several times too but never got this issue  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think you can that the exact same error when you delete  \n15:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this error means there was something upgraded  \n15:33\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0you're true : https://pastebin.com/0rf3icvZ  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm there is something weird  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it might be because this extension is invalid actually  \n15:34\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0i hzve the same error with \"repaire\" and \"uninstall\"  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes I think there is a bug with invalid extension actually  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what I don't understand is why you have Admin 8.3 installed  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the upgrade to 9.2 went ok ?  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/8.3/8.4/  \n15:36\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you see admin 9.2 installed too ?  \n15:37\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0I have upgraded the wiki but the admin app still in 8.4  \n15:37\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0nope  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not make much sense, somethiing happen during the upgrade ?  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does not make much sense, something happen during the upgrade ?  \n15:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway testing uninstall of invalid XAR extension  \n15:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Antoine\\_\\_\\_: did you try to restart since you have this issue ?  \n15:43\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0I don't had troubles during the upgrade. I can't restart for the moment the wiki is on service. Do you think it can resolve ?  \n15:43\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0Are u french too ?  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0for some reason you have an XAR extension marked as installed but which can't be found in the XAR extension repository, from what I see in the code it should not happen so make somehting corrupted the extension index in memory  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n15:44\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0Ok donc un restart pourrait le remettre en place ?  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's a public chat so better talk in english for other, yes a restart might fix your issue  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0still what does not make much sense is that it's impossible that upgrade went well if you don't have Admin 9.2 installed  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks a lot like an upgrade that would have crashed during it's execution  \n15:48\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0But the more strange is that i have the new style of administration menu  \n15:49\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0\"collapsible menu\"  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes so for me the Admin 9.2 was imported and then crashed while it was updating the installed extensions index  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway try to restart to see if it fixed the nullpointer exeception error  \n15:50\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0Ok merci \u00e0 toi et \u00e0 Vincent, je ferais un restart ce soir et vous tient au courant  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Antoine\\_\\_\\_: ok I can't help with this, looks like a bug. You should check if it's not already reported and fixed in jira and if not create a new issue for it. That seems important. thanks  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe tmortagne knows more about it  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just got the past messages from irc now  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with 2 minutes of lag...  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so disregard what I've said, I see thomas has already replied :)  \n16:03\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0Thanks to you two ! It was just enough to make a restart ^^ '  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Antoine\\_\\_\\_: ok :)  \n17:03\u00a0<Antoine\\_\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n17:19\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<slayerjain>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:56\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:14\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:16\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Does xwiki currently support Markdown syntax?  \n18:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0and if it does, can the settings be changed to only accept Markdown?  \n19:25\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0Hi yes markdown is supported.. you need to install markdown 1.2 extension  \n19:25\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0Hi, you can set the default syntax as markdown and remove xwiki syntax.. not sure what will happen for existing pages  \n19:25\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0Now you need to be aware that with markdown not all wysiwyg content will be kept as markdown does not support all HTML  \n19:27\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Okay, but if I am only interested in keeping basic Markdown files in the wiki, that shouldn't be a problem correct?  \n19:27\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0yes  \n19:29\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Is the wysiwyg syntax still enabled if I switch to just Markdown and disable xwiki syntax? sorry, im not very familiar with wysiwyg  \n19:35\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:35\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Well, i can just try it out and get my answer. Thanks for the help!  \n19:58\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0I'm not sure exactly.. \u00a0you can set the wiki to only use Wiki editor also  \n19:58\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0There is a setting per user for this  \n20:00\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0It seems to only allow Markdown when I select the edit button. However, if i select wysiwyg, or wiki, under the edit button, it will allow me to edit in those styles  \n20:00\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Is there a way to disable these buttons maybe?  \n20:01\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0You are advanced this is why you have the choice, otherwise it will choose what is in your settings  \n20:01\u00a0<slayerjain>\u00a0has quit  \n20:01\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0Worst case you can disable in the template  \n20:01\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0Now the wysiwyg works with Markdown  \n20:02\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0it's just that if you do too fancy stuff in your wysiwyg it might be stripped  \n20:03\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0Okay, that makes sense. I will keep working with it. Thanks again!  \n20:18\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_8>\u00a0has quit\n"}
