No unusable ajax tree thing.  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:18): Meta+G is cool. But all users asks me \"What is Meta?\".  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:18): I can't change the text \"Jump to any page in the wiki (Meta+G)\" cause it is not part of the edit this panel page.  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:20): It's in resources/js/xwiki/widgets/jumpToPage.js  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:21): It's not localized yet  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:22): The top menu panel is flickering whenever I scroll.  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:22): Yes, that's a Firefox bug triggered by our skin  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:22): It's a known issue  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:23): Fix it!  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:23): :-)  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:23): It's the user interface.  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:23): The user.  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:26): In some older XWiki version, the right menu was on the left side. And there was a simple navigation panel which allows me the navigate through the spaces. Space -> Page -> Sub page -> Sub page. Is this navigation panel still there?  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:28): Yes, use the panel wizard to find it  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:30): There is a \"Recently Created\" and \"Recently Modified\" panel. Is there also a \"Recently Changed\" panel which contains recently modified and recently created pages?  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:31): If it's no  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:31): If it's not in the panel list, then no  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:31): The panel list is in the Panels/ space  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:32): But Recently Modified already does that  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:32): It lists both new old documents  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:34): I am complaining a lot. Sorry for that. :-)  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:34): But XWiki is really cool.  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:34): Only the standard user interface is a little bit confusing.  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:36): Yes, we're trying to improve it this summer  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:36): If you have any particular suggestions, please report them on jira.xwiki.org or on the mailing list  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:36): Feedback is always welcome  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:38): I have a ParentPage and a ChildPage. The ChildPage is a child of the ParentPage. In the Navigation panel the ChildPage is not listed under the ParentPage.  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:38): You can vote for http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XSTOUCAN-9  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:39): Yes, the Navigation Panel lists flat spaces  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:41): Any other panel which shows it hierarchical?  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:42): The page structure.  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:42): The page hierarchy structure.  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:44): Removing \"position: fixed;\" from the CSS of the #actionmenu stops the flickering.  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:46): Yes, but the menu doesn't stay in place anymore  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:46): It's supposed to be accessible without having to scroll up  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:51): Opera don't have this flickering problem. It's scrolls super smooth. :-)  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:52): Really cool.  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:53): The SpaceIndex http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SpaceIndex?space=Main is also a flat list?  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:53): Yes, the only one with this problem is Firefox on Linux  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:53): Yes  \nhuubert - (29/06/2009 00:57): Is this http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/AllDocs table widget a third party JavaScript library?  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:57): No  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:57): It uses a library, but it's custom code  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:58): Anyway, the code that generates the tree structure is in the wiki  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:58): Just that it's not used  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:58): I have to sleep now  \nsdumitriu - (29/06/2009 00:58): Bye  \nsdumitriu left at 00:58 (\"Leaving.\")  \nhuubert left #xwiki at 00:58  \nEnygma` left at 02:15 (\"Leaving.\")  \narunreddy joined #xwiki at 06:22  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 06:32  \nkaaloo joined #xwiki at 08:21  \nmflorea left at 08:26 (\"Leaving\")  \ncristinaS joined #xwiki at 08:45  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 08:48  \nvmassol left at 08:55 ()  \nj-saturne joined #xwiki at 08:55  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 08:56  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 08:57  \nasyd - (29/06/2009 09:00): hello there  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 09:24  \ntrifon joined #xwiki at 09:24  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 09:47  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 09:54  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 10:05  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 10:11  \nglerouge joined #xwiki at 10:11  \nj-saturne left #xwiki at 10:45  \ncristinaS left at 11:07 (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 11:19  \nlucaa left at 11:20 (\"Leaving.\")  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 11:27  \ncristinaS joined #xwiki at 11:33  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 11:45  \narunreddy\\_ joined #xwiki at 11:56  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 11:56): Hi Enygma`  \nEnygma` - (29/06/2009 11:57): hi venkatesh  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 11:57): Hi, I implemented the xeclipse-part for moving/renaming attachment  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 11:58): while actually running, I'm getting a xmlrpc error  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 11:58): org.xwiki.eclipse.core.XWikiEclipseException: org.apache.xmlrpc.XmlRpcException: No such handler: confluence1.moveAttachment  \narunreddy\\_ left at 11:58 (Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer))  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 11:58): Full stack trace: -  \narunreddy\\_ joined #xwiki at 11:59  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 11:59): http://venkatesh.pastebin.com/m6e50345f  \nanamarias left at 12:00 ()  \nEnygma` - (29/06/2009 12:00): well, does the running XWiki have a patched version of the xmlrpc server side?

If you exposed it separately, as an non-confluence compatible extension, it might be using some other prefix  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 12:05): oh  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 12:06): I think its confluene 2.0 specification.  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 12:06): moveAttachment  \nEnygma` - (29/06/2009 12:07): try playing with the prefix, it should be the cause of this.  \nsdumitriu left at 12:07 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 12:08): ok  \nvenkatesh - (29/06/2009 12:08): let me see  \narunreddy left at 12:08 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 12:11  \nsdumitriu left at 12:34 (\"Leaving.\")  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 12:55  \ntachirei joined #xwiki at 13:01  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 13:07  \nvenkatesh left at 13:11 ()  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 13:43  \ntachirei left #xwiki at 13:47  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 14:19  \nanamarias left at 14:59 ()  \nalexmaru joined #xwiki at 15:46  \nalexmaru left at 15:48 (Remote closed the connection)  \nalexmaru joined #xwiki at 15:54  \nxwikibot joined #xwiki at 17:50  \nkaaloo left at 18:11 (Remote closed the connection)  \nlucaa left #xwiki at 18:17  \njvdrean left at 18:20 ()  \nalexmaru1 joined #xwiki at 18:25  \nmflorea left at 18:25 (\"Leaving\")  \njvelociter left at 18:29 ()  \nglerouge - (29/06/2009 18:32): jk\\_work as of today, there's no such way that I know of  \nglerouge - (29/06/2009 18:32): however we've been doing something similar for files in XWiki WOrkspaces  \nglerouge - (29/06/2009 18:32): one document per uploaded file  \nglerouge - (29/06/2009 18:32): thus you had comments for a given document  \nglerouge - (29/06/2009 18:33): right now you have versioning for attached files and you could consider a page is the \"folder\" for those documents  \nglerouge - (29/06/2009 18:33): that's what happens in practice in webdav view for instance  \nglerouge left at 18:33 (\"Gone chasing a unicorn in the twilight zone\")  \nalexmaru left at 18:42 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))  \nalexmaru1 left at 18:46 ()  \nalexmaru joined #xwiki at 18:46  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 18:58  \ntmortagne left at 18:59 (\"Ex-Chat\")  \nKermitTheFragger left at 19:06 (\"Leaving\")  \nanamarias left at 19:22 ()  \ncristinaS left at 19:29 (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))  \nEnygma` left at 19:30 (\"Leaving.\")  \njk\\_work\\_ joined #xwiki at 19:42  \njk\\_work left at 19:58 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))  \narunreddy\\_ left at 20:07 (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 20:12  \njk\\_work\\_ left at 20:20 ()  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 20:36  \nkaaloo joined #xwiki at 20:41  \njk\\_work joined #xwiki at 20:51  \ncristinaS joined #xwiki at 21:06  \nvmassol left at 21:23 ()  \njvdrean left at 21:38 ()  \ncristinaS left at 21:40 (\"Yummy, like ircing on a cake!
