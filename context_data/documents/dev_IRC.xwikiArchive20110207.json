sound neat!  \n09:35\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, but being the release manager requires to spent more time on the release and less on finishing work for that release  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd really like us to be clean in term of release dates (time boxing) as much as possible otherwise it's the end, everybody slips and we can't manage a schedule  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but can't you do that for M3?

 \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO you have 2 choices  \n09:41\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0that's also a good question  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) your tests are there to help the current release and you need to test at least 1 week before the release and as soon as some new feature is committed  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) your tests are for the following releases and you test just after a release is done  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and what find are stuff to be fixed for the next release  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm there can be a 3rd possibility  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which we wanted to do but haven't done yet)  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03) stage the release and let is be avail for testing for several days  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0For 3) to work we would need to put the staging in our planning schedule  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO we could do that only for the final release  \n09:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0FTM I'd go with 1)  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0allow for 1 full week of staging  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm we could consider our RC to be staging actually  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so your testing strategy sburjan could be a mix  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you do 1) for milestones and 3) for the RC  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so 1) is ongoing best effort in teting  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tedting  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0teting  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there you go ;)  \n09:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:)  \n09:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n09:46\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'm gonna switch tactics then  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you have to test the whole thing when it's published in RC too and you're the one to give us the green light for the final  \n09:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I test all releases  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm talking about when you have to test  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) is before releases  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03) is after RC is released  \n09:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ij  \n09:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note to self: if we were to remove milestones and RC we could apply the same strategy but with a staging period for each release  \n09:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0XWIKI-5960  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's minor and not really a bug  \n09:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XPSWIZZLE << URL outdated  \n09:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I know  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(IMO)  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wouldn't call it a release blocker  \n09:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'm just doing my job, reporting everything .. not trying to block the release  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: why do you list it?

 \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to fix it we'd need more feedback  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what should it be?  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0give me an example of how it should be  \n19:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I don't know what should it be, I should just be able to work with it  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like how you'd expect to use such an api  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's actually very very easy  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0resolver transform string into ref  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's it  \n19:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0let's argue about this face to face, please  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can't be simpler  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the hard part  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that we have LOTS of use cases  \n19:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in this case yes, it's simple  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you have to pick the right resolver  \n19:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but e.g. I still need to find out which resolver I need  \n19:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0which is tricky  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, it's hard for me too  \n19:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I always have to read the javadoc of the resolvers to pick the right one and think a lot about it  \n19:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but this will shrink the community  \n19:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0honestly  \n19:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not really  \n19:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're not supposed to use resolver/serializers in most cases  \n19:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the issue here  \n19:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0well, it depends, if you expect people to spend 3 hours trying to figure out how to parse a ref, a lot of people will give u  \n19:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0p  \n19:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that we wanted the rendering module to be usable outside of xwiki  \n19:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@lucaa: that's the point they don't have to  \n19:16\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so I don't fall under contributors?  \n19:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ldubost doesn't fall under contributors?  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what happens is that we're in the middle of converting strings to Refs  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we still have ltos of string around  \n19:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes, but if refs looks like this, it cannot be good  \n19:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and to get a contributor back is tough  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again  \n19:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0in my opinion  \n19:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't have a single clue  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as to how make this any easier than what I've said  \n19:18\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ok  \n19:18\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0actually I should stop here  \n19:18\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0my point is not necessarrily to change it  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if you have ideas you should speak up  \n19:18\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0my point is that it's damn complicated  \n19:18\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0really really  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re rendering I know how to fix it  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not  \n19:18\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and we should take this into account when building it  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki is darn complicated  \n19:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I agree  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0resolvers are really simple  \n19:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but then I think we shouldn't look at wordpress and ask ourselves why we have less contributors :)  \n19:19\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0resolvers maybe  \n19:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is ciomplete FUD  \n19:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the fact that wordpress code is simpler)  \n19:20\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the whole reference thing, relative absolute resolve relative to absolute from string from entity, etc, is very complicated  \n19:20\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I don't know if it's simpler or not  \n19:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa: you should look at how it was before and then judge  \n19:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was about 100 times more cmplex before  \n19:20\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but what I think is that, the moment we cannot work with our own APIs, we shouldn't expect others to be able to  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't care about this discussion  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what I care is ideas to improve it  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm definitely for the simplest possible api  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we all are  \n19:21\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0at least please remember it, even if you don't care  \n19:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have lots of ideas to make it simpler as I said above but they're not about changing the api  \n19:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I will do that too, when I will find the time, I will write an essay about why I cannot work with it and how would it be simpler for me.
