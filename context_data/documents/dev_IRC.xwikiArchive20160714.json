Block HTML content (such as tables) cannot be displayed. Try leaving an empty line before and after the HTML macro.  \n13:38\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0any idea what could be going wrong ?  \n13:54\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0jonesmeier: try adding some space before and after the macro  \n13:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0empty paragraphs  \n14:04\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:23\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0evalica: ok thanks, i already tried that with just empty lines  \n14:25\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0oh sorry, i forgot to mention: it works when using a YouTube URL, just not with the attachment  \n14:25\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0in the examples on the macro page, the macro is used with a videoPoster attribute: {{video attachment=\"my-video.webm\" videoPoster=\"poster.jpg\"/}}  \n14:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0maybe you need to add the \"attach:\" prefix to the file name  \n14:26\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0is this poster image necessary when using an attachment ?  \n14:26\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0ok thanks i'll try that  \n14:33\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0adding the \"attach:\" prefix did not work, i just got a \"attachment not found\" error, which was the same as when i used a random filename that really didn't exist  \n14:33\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0so it seems the error with the HTML macro only appears if it's actually trying to render the player for the attachment  \n14:38\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0thank you for the suggestions though  \n14:46\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0adding the videoPoster attribute doesn't help  \n14:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0jonesmeier: not sure if you know how to do this, but you need to go in Macros/Video20?editor=object and in the 'Macro code' section, you need to have: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#if ($videoFormat != \"\")  \n14:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{{html clean='false'}}  \n14:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I've added the \"clean='false' \" part  \n14:50\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I will create an issue and report the bug  \n14:57\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0jonesmeier: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XVIDEO-8  \n15:00\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0jonesmeier: thanks for report  \n15:04\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0evalica: thank you very much! i will see if i can edit the macro and fix it here aswell for the time being  \n15:05\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k - good luck :)  \n15:18\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0evalica: i managed to edit the macro, and it is working!  \n15:19\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0still a little problem though, when i view the page in the WYSIWYG editor, the player is displayed flawlessly  \n15:21\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0when i view the page outside of the editor though, it displays the video (clickable for start/stop), and what would be the controls undearneath it (play button, time etc.) is displayed as plain text, each object on a new line  \n15:22\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0i have tried it in a current Firefox and MS Edge  \n15:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0jonesmeier: if you go to Macros/Video20 do you have the same problem? it might be that the attachment format has a strange player, or maybe you have some CSS that is interfering \u2026 or not sure. It is a problem for a clean instance? Since on my local instance I don't have the same issue.  \n15:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0I am testing on 8.2-RC1  \n15:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0if you can reproduce the problem on a clean instance, it should be reported \u2026. but since I don't reproduce it, maybe it something that just you have?  \n15:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0a picture is worth 1000 words :P  \n15:29\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0oh i didnt think of checking the example page, and yes i have the same problem there  \n15:29\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0this is an XWiki Enterprise 6.1, so i should probably try updating that before i report it :)  \n15:31\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0thanks again for looking into this, and promptly fixing it too!  \n15:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0jonesmeier: I see controls similar to this image http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Video+Macro/play-attachment.png if you see something different, an upgrade might help, but it could also be from some custom stylising you have  \n15:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0np - good luck  \n15:32\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0i will see if updating the wiki resolves that last bit, and report back!  \n15:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k  \n15:33\u00a0<jonesmeier>\u00a0yeah my player looked similar, its rendered correctly in the WYSIWYG  \n15:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:39\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:05\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:24\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:19\u00a0<[d\\_\\_d]>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<[d\\_\\_d]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:43\u00a0<[d\\_\\_d]>\u00a0has quit  \n20:49\u00a0<[d\\_\\_d]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<Guest40218>\u00a0Hello.
