 \n10:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when I'm done on my side making it work I will setup jenkins agent to build it automatically  \n10:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0plus that will automatically deploy the apk on maven.xwiki.org for anyone to test the last build easily  \n10:37\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0here is how to setup eclipse-ADT (android plugin) http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html  \n10:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0thanks  \n10:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what OS are you working on BTW ?  \n10:38\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0I didn't do any unit test in android. so have to check on that  \n10:38\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0ubuntu  \n10:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok at least if it works for you should be work for me then ;)  \n10:39\u00a0<j-saturne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:43\u00a0<j-saturne>\u00a0has quit  \n10:44\u00a0<j-saturne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Chami1: I think the minimum requirement should be android 2.1 and not 2.2 since there is still a lot of phones stuck on 2.1  \n10:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0unless you really need some API existing only in 2.2 and it's ok  \n10:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lets 2.1 should be the minimum if not too painful  \n10:46\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0most of the 2.2 are working fine in 2.1  \n10:46\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0ok, i will change target sdk to 2.1  \n10:47\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0ah, forget to tell  \n10:47\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0handling xml is little bit hard and for this one I use json objects  \n10:48\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0shall I continue with json or is it essential to use xml ?  \n10:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what do you mean by hard ? reslet does not take care itself of the XML -> Java part ?  \n10:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you are not supposed to manipulate XML  \n10:49\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not essential to use XML no but I don't understand why you have a problem with XML  \n10:52\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0since I told you I will commit within yesterday i try hard to decode xml  \n10:52\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0but it take time to study it  \n10:52\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0but JSON handling in android is very easy  \n10:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0tmortagne, Chami1: http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Most-Android-devices-still-running-version-2-2-1254624.html  \n10:53\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Android 2.1 = 21%  \n10:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Chami1: AFAIK there is a bug in the JSON serializer in the version of restlet we are using so XL is safer  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but why is it easier to work with JSON ?  \n10:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you have a library in android taking care of JSON -> Java object ?  \n10:55\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0yeah  \n10:55\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0not to java object  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if that so and you don't need restlet ar all then that's great and you should really use JSON  \n10:55\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0it can decode easily  \n10:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0decode and do what with it ?  \n10:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you plan to code youself what restlet is doing already for XML I don't really see the point unless restlet android lib is very big  \n10:57\u00a0<StefanM>\u00a0has quit  \n10:57\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0currently it retrieves list of search results.(only the title)  \n10:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: thanks, 21% seems big enough as a minimum requirement IMO  \n10:57\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0to do that I decode JSON object  \n10:58\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0agree with you on reslet thing  \n10:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking how big restlet is  \n11:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0btw if you say JSON is easier that XML it's even possible restlet is using JSON instead of XML  \n11:01\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0:)  \n11:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in any case I think what's important is to let others do the painful work ;)  \n11:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm it's not very light, looks liek they don't separate client and server in separate libraries...  \n11:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0650K at least  \n11:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0bu there is probably lighter to do just the XML <-> JAVA part  \n11:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Chami1: http://simple.sourceforge.net/  \n11:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0looks like it's the JAXB guy in android environment  \n11:08\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0sdumitriu: it's not big deal to change target to 2.1. I'll do  \n11:09\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but does not seems that light either actually  \n11:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Chami1: just found http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/  \n11:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's handling JSON <-> Java and it's 14.3 Ko  \n11:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0best solution I could find for now  \n11:18\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0seems like this is feasible  \n11:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and http://benjii.me/2010/04/deserializing-json-in-android-using-gson/  \n11:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0as a tutorial  \n11:21\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has quit  \n11:21\u00a0<SvenDowideit>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:23\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0after we deserialize we have to make java objects according to jaxb model. isn't it?  \n11:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes but google-gson is supposed to unserialize in any java object as they say  \n11:27\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\"Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of\"  \n11:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sounds good  \n11:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so you should be able to reuse existing XWiki rest model jar  \n11:30\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0i'll check  \n11:31\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0btw is there any way to remove all github files and add newly to the repo  \n11:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Chami1: as I told you in the mail basically you can simply do whatever you want in the filesystem and do a git commit -a since you are the only one committing for now it should be ok  \n11:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you don't really need to take care too much to use proper git mv and things like that like it's was absolutely necessary with svn  \n11:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: right ?  \n11:34\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0doesn't it maintaing subversioning of files  \n11:34\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0?  \n11:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Chami1: as long as you don't modify a file you can move it where you want git is supposed to be able to find it, it's not hierarchical like svn is  \n11:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but if you want to be extra carefull you can always use git mv  \n11:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in any case didn't you wanted to remove everything ?  \n11:38\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0first I should create a new folder and have to move all files to it  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Chami1: btw you can do that with EGit as I told you  \n11:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it will take care of using equivalent of git mv when needed  \n11:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0just install EGit and \"share\" your eclipse project  \n11:48\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0i'm afraid of making two copies in each file  \n11:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Git automatically detects file moves, git mv is just a nice way to do mv & git rm & git add  \n12:00\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0sdumitriu: seems that XWIKI-5319 is back  \n12:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but it seems only happens when unsing https  \n12:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0also no proxy is involved.

 \n16:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Slow to generate?  \n16:55\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Java only implements random GUIDs, so it's not that costly  \n16:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I have a dilema...  \n16:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'd like to change the mapping for a field, to switch from 2000 chars to 255, so that it fits in a varchar, and I can create an index on it  \n16:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But Hibernate doesn't alter tables to change the definition of existing columns  \n16:58\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0This means that we'll get a stacktrace in the log when starting a new version on an older database  \n16:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0slow to binary search since they're sparse  \n16:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's not critical, since it's just a log entry, and the only problem is that the index won't be created  \n16:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: will it make something not working ?  \n16:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But otherwise it works  \n16:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0is there a simple solution we can provide in the release note to get cleaner db ?  \n16:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So it's a + for the future, on clean installations  \n17:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0With a small - for upgrades  \n17:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0There is a solution, but it will take some time  \n17:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sdumitriu: I mean what we could tel user to do if he wants  \n17:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Map to a different column, and write a migrator that moves the data between the two columns  \n17:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not a solution from us  \n17:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We already did that for the minor edit field, IIRC  \n17:00\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that would be well enough IMO  \n17:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Oh, we could say \"execute this ALTER TABLE command on your database\"  \n17:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0as long as it does not generate any fonctional issue  \n17:03\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I think I'll go the extra mile and do the database migration  \n17:05\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I also want to do some more migration on the activitystream data to fix XE-760  \n17:05\u00a0<j-saturne1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:07\u00a0<j-saturne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:42\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0guys, why is CI agent-2 running tests?
