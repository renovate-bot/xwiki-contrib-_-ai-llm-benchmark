In all tset cases, after deleting an annotation, all the other little yellow marks disappear. this is why hovering on a annotation will bring the modal in the top left corner.  \n13:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I was able to reproduce this manually in certain cases. it seems that the \"Show annotations\" from tab is not taken in consideration  \n13:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you opened a jira issue?  \n14:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0no, because I don't know exactly if it is a bug or not  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the box in the corner is a bug for sure  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you can reproduce it manually it can only be a bug  \n14:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, I will try to reproduce manually, but it doesn't happend in all cases. I have to find a solid test case to be able to open a jira issue  \n14:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it's most likely a js issue  \n14:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and the 2), I think it's safe to remove that line, I put it long time ago to assure I will get the notification from the bottom  \n14:05\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but we can discuss them in detail when you get back  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: let's see if the annotation test is fixed in http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/68/ ;)  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got to go, bbiab  \n14:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0okay  \n14:22\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:39\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:40\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0mflorea: I have a question about the office importing utility, mainly about the display macro and thought you might know something, or is there someone else that might be better to ask  \n14:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Hi mbryant  \n14:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0what is the question?  \n14:42\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0when you upload a ppt, it automaticallly puts them into a gallery type mode that allows you to flip through individual slides... is there a way, in 3.1 that would allow me to have all the images displayed at once, rather than a slideshow  \n14:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there are two different, but related, features regarding ppt files: preview and import.  \n14:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0preview = if you have the oo server connected then you should see an eye icon near each ppt attachment  \n14:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0technically, the preview is done by importing the ppt in a temporary directory on the server and using the gallery macro to display the slides  \n14:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0import = oo server is used to extract slide images from the ppt file, which then are attached to the target wiki page. Again, attached images are displayed using the gallery macro  \n14:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: which of these two features would you like to customize?  \n14:47\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0we are working with import, so is there a way to have the import without the gallery  \n14:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n14:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0just a sec to test something  \n15:16\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: the easiest way is to remove the {{gallery}} wrapping after the import. Of course, this is not automated and it's a pain if you have many ppt files to import. Another quick solution if to [re]move the uicomponents/widgets/gallery/gallery.js but you won't be able to use the gallery macro anymore.  \n15:18\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the best option is to add a parameter to the gallery macro when importing a ppt so be able to distinguish between a user made image gallery and a presentation gallery  \n15:22\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0thanks mflorea, your help has been apprecited.. how bad are the errors if i just remove the gallery.js, because in a plans, we really have no direct need for the gallery at all  \n15:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mbryant: fyi the gallery macro simply wraps all the images with a class=gallery DIV. The slideshow is generated by uicomponents/widgets/gallery/gallery.js which hides all the images and displayed one at a time  \n15:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0if you don't use the gallery macro anywhere else then there is no side effect of removing the gallery.js file  \n15:23\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0alright, thank you very much, I do apprecite your time..  \n15:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you're welcome  \n15:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0vmassol: Yes it is possible to invite to a closed wiki, depending on how you close the wiki. see: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/blob/master/xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/src/test/it/org/xwiki/test/ui/invitation/InvitationTest.java#L510  \n15:25\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: ok\u2026 I'm asking because on http://ossgtp.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Invitation/WebHome there's an error text saying \"Invitations cannot be accepted because this wiki is closed. ...\"  \n15:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I says \"Afin de permettre aux personnes invit\u00e9es de rejoindre le wiki, veuillez sauver http://ossgtp.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Invitation/InvitationGuestActions avec un utilisateur dot\u00e9 des droits de programming.\u00a0\"  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I have already saved that doc with a user having PR  \n15:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(no idea why it keeps saying it\u2026)  \n15:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Let me take a look at the code, I hope I didn't say the wrong document needed PR.  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: if I want to remove past invitation messages can I delete the objects from http://ossgtp.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/Invitation/InvitationMessages?editor=object ?  \n15:36\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n15:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Yes you can.  \n15:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n16:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Is there anyone who is interested in doing the build manager job for this week?  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it's thomas or marius's turn: http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/BuildManagerRoster  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or jerome  \n16:20\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they have done it only once  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oldest in the list is thomas now...  \n16:21\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0From looking at the list I can't really tell but that makes some sense.  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: you're in luck :)  \n16:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: today is the only day i'm working this week  \n16:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok for nex week  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0acutally Denis has never done it yet....  \n16:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Should I put you down for next week so we can avoid this conversation next run around?  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so either Denis or mflorea or jvelociter for this week (it's a short week btw)  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: yep  \n16:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cjdelisle: +1  \n16:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(put me)  \n16:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm going to bump my number up to the 15th since I was still picking away at the tests yesterday.  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: actually would be great if you could continue working on the attachment test issue ;)  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could do a joint venture between you and me as build manager for the week  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n16:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I have kind of neglected the flickering attachment test you gave me, it looks like a race condition with the attachments and I have found another attachment (deletion) issue which looks very serious.  \n16:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*a race condition in the test  \n16:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That is the one I have been concentrating most of my time on.  \n16:28\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm kind of busy this week catching up with my mails after the holidays and the work on app within minutes.
