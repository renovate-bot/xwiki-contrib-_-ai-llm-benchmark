Now it looks like \"normal wiki pages\". Can you help me, pls?  \n10:57\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:19\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0Can someone help me? I've renamed the blog space and it doesn't look like blog anymore now.  \n11:32\u00a0<moep>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<Evi\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:42\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:54\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n11:55\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n12:55\u00a0<M-cescobarresi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:57\u00a0<M-cescobarresi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n12:57\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0I have problems with the blog app. Would you reccomend to deinstall it and reinstall it again? I have renamed it an know it does not work properly anymore.  \n13:10\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0Evi - you could try that - if you are an advanced user, you could check to see if the appropiate objects are set on those pages  \n13:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0that you said are now normal pages: you can check for BlogClass, BlogPostClass objects ....  \n13:12\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0how can I check if the appropiate objecte are set on those pages?  \n13:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0in /bin/edit/ mode \u2026. when you edit a page, you have at the end of the URL ?editor=wysiwyg  \n13:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0or ?editor=wiki  \n13:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0replace this with: ?editor=object  \n13:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and see what objects you have set there - you should compare a normal blog post, with the one with problems  \n13:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and see if something is missing - but to be honest I'm not sure what you did or what the problem is  \n13:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0this is just a way to verify the objects are there  \n13:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0It might be a bit hard :) so you should try reinstalling the app | try to rename the blog post back :) I don't know - there are multiple variants  \n13:17\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0when I add objects, there title, content is empty - is that normal?  \n13:18\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0I guess I cannot fix it and have to deinstall the whole wiki  \n13:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, it is normal that contents of objects are initially empty. Blog posts should have content in the already existing objects, however.  \n13:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, you renamed the complete blog app. I am afraid that this does not work. You can try to rename the app back (i.e. the start page) and then things should go back to normal  \n13:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0Evi: if you cannot uninstall, than you should reimport it. You should go to http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Blog+Application , click on Download, go to Administration - Import, and reimport the XAR file.  \n13:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0actually, you need to reimport the version of your wiki.  \n13:33\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0see what version you have and replace 8.1 with your version in http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/rest/repository/extensions/org.xwiki.platform%3Axwiki-platform-blog-ui/versions/8.1/file?rid=maven-xwiki  \n13:35\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0alright, thx, I'll try - to rename it back does not work out, cause a error appears 'A document with the name (Blog.WebHome) exists already. Pls give another name'  \n13:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0and if you go to Blog.WebHome what do you see?  \n13:39\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0then comes the blog page, but it looks like normal wiki-page and not like a blog page. when I add a page to the blog I can only create \"normal wiki pages\"  \n13:39\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0maybe on the Blog.WebHome you have a redirect object (the page was not deleted, but was added a redirect to the new location). You can manually delete Blog.WebHome or edit the redirect object.  \n13:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0To be honest I am not sure what you describing \u2026.  \n13:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0if you don't have the Blog.WebHome it's normal that when you press Add, you create normal pages. You can create Blog post only from the WebHome you just deleted  \n13:41\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0ok  \n13:43\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0So i try to delete Blog.WebHome  \n13:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0oh, wait  \n13:44\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0ok I wait  \n13:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you get a redirect from Blog.WebHome to the page in the new location, automatically  \n13:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if you try to go to Blog.WebHome  \n13:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0that is the blog home page in its new location, we do not want to trow away that one  \n13:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi: did you rename with children or just the Blog homepage?  \n13:45\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0with children  \n13:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, wow, I just tried locally, and there are now a log of rediects  \n13:46\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and with automatic redirect, right?  \n13:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0one can delete them one by one, but that is very combersome  \n13:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0one can see them in the \"Page Index\", and in theory delete from there  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi: go to the following url http://yourDomain:port/xwiki/bin/delete/Blog/  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0check \"Affect children\"  \n13:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, no, one can delete the blog home page directly hand things are ok  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and click delete  \n13:48\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, Enygma` has the right link. I just tired and that works :)  \n13:48\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0this will delete the old Blog location that is now full of redirects  \n13:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Next, go to your renamed blog location and do a rename (with children but do not include automatic redirects) to the old location \"Blog\"  \n13:50\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0Manage blogs on this wiki does not work, there are vilocity errors  \n13:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tried it locally and I also got \"The execution of the [velocity] script macro is not allowed.\"  \n13:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, here too, oen need to edit a few pages, which suddenly are created by the \"anonymous user\"  \n13:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Blog/Archive \u00a0and Blog/BlogCode  \n13:53\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0what do I have to do extactly?  \n13:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, and Blog/BlogTemplate \u00a0... this list gets longer :-/  \n13:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0those pages need to be fixed to have the proper content author  \n13:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I wonder if uninstall and reinstall might be quicker at this moment  \n13:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0nah, does not work, extension manager wants me to uninstall the complete UI, of course :p  \n13:55\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0reimport it from e.x.o - using the Download XAR  \n13:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0xar import would be perfect now  \n13:55\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi: what version of XWiki do you have?  \n13:55\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0\u00a07.4.2  \n13:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0download this xar file locally on your computer http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/rest/repository/extensions/org.xwiki.platform%3Axwiki-platform-blog-ui/versions/7.4.2/file?rid=maven-xwiki  \n13:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0then go to your wiki in Administration > Content > Import  \n13:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and upload the xar file from your machine (that you have just downloaded)  \n13:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when upload is complete it will be listed in the \"Available packages\"  \n13:57\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0ok, thank you. I'll try  \n13:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when it`s available, select it, and then click Import  \n13:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0when the import is complete, your blog should be working fine  \n13:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0let us know if it doesn`t  \n13:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi: you could also check \"import as backup\" before pressing \"Import\", just to be sure  \n13:59\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0there are several options: 1. add this version to exisiting 2. replace existing with the new one 3. set history back to 1.1  \n13:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(that option sets XWiki.Admin as the author of theose files)  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0leave the default (Add a new version to the existing page)  \n14:00\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0ok  \n14:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so you will have the history intact  \n14:00\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0and I set a check in the the backup field  \n14:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, to make it have the same users as when it`s a clean wiki installation  \n14:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0(user set as author)  \n14:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0then click import  \n14:02\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0it is there  \n14:02\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0OMG - I am so happy ! Made my DAY  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0happy everything is ok  \n14:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0sorry for the problem, we`ll create an issue since that is definitely a bug at least in the rename operation (the second time we used it to fix the blog)  \n14:03\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0as a general note, try to avoid renaming applications since they will not work anymore  \n14:04\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0renaming data (or application entries - like a blog post, etc) is fine most of the time, but renaming the application's code or homepage usually leads to bad results :)  \n14:05\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0ok, there are now 2 blogs..So I'm wondering what to do now..I just need one  \n14:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0what do you mean by 2 blogs?  \n14:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0how did you deduce that?  \n14:06\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0I don't know, but there are two now - and under the logo 2 big \"blog\" buttons  \n14:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0this does not go away when you reload the page ?  \n14:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah, in the app bar you mean on, the left  \n14:07\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0yes  \n14:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0do both icons link to the same page ?  \n14:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0clicking on them takes you to different pages or is it the same page?  \n14:08\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0they link to the same page  \n14:08\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0is restarting you wiki an option?  \n14:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0that might fix it since the import probably re-registered the AppBar entry for the blog  \n14:09\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0yes, I see  \n14:09\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so it`s the same blog link, just listed twice  \n14:09\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0can I delete one \"blog\" somehow?  \n14:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0restarting XWiki should delete the extra \"blog\" entry  \n14:10\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0xwiki/bin/view/Blog/Management works now  \n14:17\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0I just delteted one blog with its children. Now, everything looks fine. One blog - just like I started today bevore renaming it (which was a fault!)! So thank you very very much, Enygma and ClemensR for your help! I'm very thankfull. Maybe you could make a hint for everybody. Maybe I am not the only one with this problem. Thank you!  \n14:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, glad to hera that it works. As Enygma` said, that renaming things back did not repair everything is definitely a bug and should not happened  \n14:24\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:24\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:30\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n14:54\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n14:54\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:12\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0Hello, it's me again. ^^ I have a short question concerning http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/RecentBlogEntriesMacro. I've installed it and I like it a lot. But is it normal that a page in the wiki appears named 'code' containing another page named 'http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/RecentBlogEntriesMacro'. Of course I don't want that this is seen by every user. So I can hide the parent page. But is this \"normal\"? I think it i  \n15:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: Just created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13492 based on the recent discussion on IRC.  \n15:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi: not very clear what you are describing. What page in the wiki, where do you see that?  \n15:18\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ClemensR: created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13492 for the rename issue.  \n15:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0thanks :)  \n15:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`: dup of XWIKI-13401  \n15:19\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0It is not really a problem. I can hide the page. A page named 'code' appeared in the wiki unter 'pages'. This page containes the RecentBlogEntriesMacro, which I've just installed.  \n15:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Enygma`, ClemensR check the \"Backlinks and PR\" thread on the security mailing list  \n15:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: so the problem appears only on pages that contain links to the currently renamed page  \n15:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0why not just update the links in those pages and save them with the previous author/contentAuthor?  \n15:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, or its child pages (when child pages are included in rename)  \n15:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0because we would generate a change in the history for a user that did not really do the change?  \n15:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0again, check the thread, what you propose is a solution, but it's not right for user X to see that he modified some page when he didn't  \n15:26\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n15:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0Evi: I remember what you mean. That macro is located in a badly chosen location. The best option for you right now is to simply hide that \"code\" page.  \n15:28\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0alright, thx Enygma. I just wondered, if this is normal or if I've made a mistake. But then, it's perfectly fine. I think this macro is usefull.  \n15:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0mflorea: answered on the mail.
