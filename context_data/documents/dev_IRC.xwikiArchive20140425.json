(i don't need the documents, only attributes of that class)  \n10:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:24\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0is there .searchDocuments() equivalent for java component?  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: searchDocument is java :) but we recommend using the query manager  \n10:26\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0vmassol: context.getWiki() has only search method, so injecting QueryManager is better?  \n10:26\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I dn't understand  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what do you want to do?  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Component+Module would help  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I thought you want to search documents from Java but apparently not)  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*wanted  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you don't search for java components, you get them or have them injected  \n10:29\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0well, i need to run piece of code on every user with specific class... so i thought of getting all documents with that class (LDAPProfileClass), checking it against XWikiUsers \u00a0and then executing this code  \n10:30\u00a0<spu7nic>\u00a0has quit  \n10:30\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0since there are thousands of users, i need to do it asynchronously (periodical job), but parsing fullName from executed query and creating documenterefence from that seems like bad practice :)  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is bad practice?  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still don't understand what's your question!  \n10:32\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0how do i get documents with hql inside component  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0first you should use XWQL  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0much simpler  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you shoudl use hte query manager  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0get it injected  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and use it  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Note: I'm not commetning on whether what you're doing is good or bad, I don't know about that)  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: here's an example: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-ircbot/xwiki-platform-ircbot-api/src/main/java/org/xwiki/ircbot/internal/wiki/DefaultWikiIRCModel.java#L161-161  \n10:34\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ok, thanks  \n10:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: I have a script which can reliably reproduce \"Batch update returned unexpected row count from update\" if this is interesting to you...  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well you should add it to a jira issue  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if it's a bug)  \n11:36\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, I'm looking for one which makes sense  \n11:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-235 <-- kewl, I'll reopen this one since I now have a way to reproduce :)  \n11:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0actually I'm going to open a new issue  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(you could then link them)  \n11:45\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh boy, there's more to this  \n11:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10272  \n11:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0This is very likely the same issue which is causing the bot to complain when we talk too much  \n12:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd love that we fix this one (the bot issue) :)  \n12:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0sorry for posting a troll issue ;)  \n12:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0The store is a mess...  \n12:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I was asked to test concurrent uploads of fs attachments w/ clustering... now we're looking for a definition of \"known good\"  \n12:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:36\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n13:35\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n13:41\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n13:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:19\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n14:20\u00a0<woshilap1n>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:21\u00a0<Kebir>\u00a0has quit  \n14:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<woshilap1n>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:59\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:17\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:18\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:19\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:56\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:57\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:29\u00a0<Kebir>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:36\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:02\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<Kebir>\u00a0has quit  \n17:14\u00a0<Kebir>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:17\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:56\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n20:04\u00a0<Kebir>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:13\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:23\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:12\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:53\u00a0<Kebir>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
