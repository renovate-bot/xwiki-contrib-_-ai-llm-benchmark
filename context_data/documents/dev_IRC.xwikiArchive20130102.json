(See earlier posts for 3 attempts) Last attempt was to try the zip link given me by rrodriquez. It downloaded ok but about 45 sec from finishing unzip I got the message 0x0010135 path too long. I tried clicking the start\\_wiki and the server ran but when I go to localhost:8080 I get This wizard will guide you through the process of installing, upgrading  \n00:48\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0or downgrading the XWiki distribution. You are seeing this wizard for one of the following reasons:  \n00:48\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the default wiki pages recommended for the current version of the XWiki runtime are not installed  \n00:50\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0so frankly I am about ready to give up on Xwiki. I have tried many wikis and cmses but never had this kind of silliness. Please encourage me to keep trying!!  \n00:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if you're seeing that message, it sounds like the RC-1 release just plain failed. This doesn't usually happen and I'm testing it now.  \n00:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0One issue is it's New Year's day so nobody is at work today so things are only being handled by volunteers at home.  \n00:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Note that RC-1 is a release candidate which means it's a beta test. Usually they are just fine which is why they are listed first on the download page but sometimes they have issues.  \n01:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0drsku: I have tested this version and can personally vouch for it: http://download.forge.objectweb.org/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-4.3.1.zip  \n01:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if issues persist with this version, check that your java installation is up to date.  \n01:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n01:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n01:20\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0drsku: I just tested 4.4-rc-1 which was the link sdumitriu gave to you, it works fine for me.  \n01:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Check the whole folder name of the folder which you unziped the file in to.  \n01:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0If it's something long like \u00a0C:\\really\\long\\path\\with\\a\\folder\\inside\\of\\a\\folder\\inside\\of\\a\\folder> then you might have just been unlucky enough to overrun the Windows limitation on file path length.  \n01:30\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Frankly, XWiki has the simplest installation process, which is usually painless  \n01:30\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0But from time to time special issues arise  \n01:31\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0And most of the times it's something very minor that makes everything fail  \n01:31\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The \"path too long\" error suggests that you're trying to install it someplace deep, hitting a Windows limitation  \n01:49\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n02:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n02:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n03:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n03:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n03:48\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n03:51\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n04:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n04:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n05:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n05:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n05:48\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n06:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n06:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n07:05\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0has quit  \n07:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n08:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n09:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:54\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:28\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good morning guys  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's sort http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=fixVersion+=+%224.4%22+and+resolution+=+Unresolved  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so following the discusson of a few days ago I'm moving XWIKI-8630 to 4.5M1 ok?  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same for XWIKI-8461  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and XWIKI-8207  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually moving them all to 4.5M1  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that we can release 4.4 final tomorrow, XWIKI-8599 is not that important in this list and can be fixed in 4.5M1  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok for you?  \n11:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the reason I'm proposing this is because we don't have many devs avail and we're very late already, we need to move on  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: ?  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm platform build is still failing, checking  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok my fault, fixing  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0moving issues  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so anything left before I start the 4.4 final release?  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean, sdumitriu, tmortagne, everyone: anything you absolutely need to commit in 4.4?  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not, I'll start the release  \n11:21\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0Go ahead  \n11:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nothing I can think of on my side  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok starting  \n11:22\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0same here  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I think this is for you http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/3097/console  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a06 checkstyle violations  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looking, had issue with eclipsecs and forgot to enable it again for this project  \n12:21\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n12:31\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n12:35\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:40\u00a0<helge>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:46\u00a0<helge>\u00a0Hi, one question: I upgraded to XE 4.3.1 and have a problem with the new HTML5 attachment upload. The server always responds \"The file ... is too large. Please chose a file under NaN undefined.\" This occurs only with the new widget. Any Ideas or can I disable the widget and have the old upload tool instead? Thx, helge.  \n12:47\u00a0<helge>\u00a0PS: I have Firefox 17.0 on a linux platform.  \n12:47\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0helge: hmm that would be a question for sdumitriu I guess.
