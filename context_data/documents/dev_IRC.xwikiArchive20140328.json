Problems it's forced to use http and does not follow redirects (so the request \"fails\" every time)... I guess the problem is with 5.2-5.4 (on 5.1 it works as expected), or tomcat is somehow involved in this (5.1 runs on jetty)... this also happens in update manager  \n13:40\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0got to go, if someone figures anything, please let me know at lukas[at]raska.me  \n13:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:54\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:56\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:27\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:36\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:07\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:46\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:03\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:11\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:28\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0is now known as <sdumitriu\\_[Away]>  \n19:35\u00a0<sbaloul>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:35\u00a0<xWikiUser>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:35\u00a0<xWikiUser>\u00a0Hi.
