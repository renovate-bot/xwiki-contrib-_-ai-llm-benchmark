 \n15:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't think it make a difference for the zip archiver  \n15:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0[ANN] performing the release  \n15:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0technically it makes no difference for the zip archiver yes, also it's internal things IMO and there is no retro-compatibility involved  \n15:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0on the filesystem side having folders is safer than one big file name  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(there is a limit on filename size which is usually lower than on path size)  \n15:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and the other point is the limit of files in a single directory but that's pretty huge ;)  \n15:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now in practice our complete reference cannot be bigger than 255 characters right now so it's not a huge issue in practice  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's say that I'm halfway though this refazctoring so I need to choose if I revert of continue...  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/of/or  \n15:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the most important is that folders makes easier to find your document  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0another issue is the entry point  \n15:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0after my change there's no more easy entry point  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes and there is no way to create a link to the current page since there is no standard for links  \n15:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you could crate an index.html with a redirect meta in it to the current page when the export was done  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I coud use the current page as the entry point  \n15:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/crate/create/  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0current page = current page when the export. is done  \n15:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'd need to handle the case when the current page is not in the exported HTML  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in that case no index.html  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we'll see if someone complains  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0another possibility is to generate a toc style index.html  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even easier  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not that easy :)  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have the list of exported pages  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but possibly less nice than a single entry point  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless there's no entry pojnt  \n15:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lets say a toc with the exported pages plus a link to the current one when the export was done  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in which case it's nice  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n15:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0more work for me though :)  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0some kind of export report in other words  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can link with a simple link and a <ul>  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not a big work  \n15:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/can link/can start/  \n15:50\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n15:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well the issue was reported on 7.4.4 which is not very far from the version where it was broken  \n15:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so conclusion is that we're ok to continue on the path I started  \n15:51\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's more consistent with all the other way of storing documents  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw I could also move attachment next to the page now\u2026.  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/way/ways/  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of having an \"attachment\" root  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the difficulty is colision  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll keep this one for later\u2026  \n15:55\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd have a directroy naemd after the page  \n15:55\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and inside that dir, the attachments for the page + some page.html file  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but you need to differenciate between attachment and subpages  \n15:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0file and directory?  \n16:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can't have a folder which have the same name as a file  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(not sure for all filesystem but you can't on ext4 at least from what I see)  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: ok I thought it was possible  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so indeed there would be a collision issue then  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0better keep the attachment folder then  \n18:06\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<fxavier>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:45\u00a0<fxavier>\u00a0hi there, pals!  \n18:47\u00a0<fxavier>\u00a0i was wondering if there is a way to hide a page that contains a macro but still enable unregistered users to run those macros when rendering a page. In summary, unregistered users shouldn't be able to view the macro page but should be able to use it. Is it possible? (e.g. hide Class, Sheet, Template, Template Provider but still able to see Class Pages and Create Pages)  \n18:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<Murilo>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<ol-ow2>\u00a0fxavier: try in the macro page, rights editor, allow guest to view this macro page (also allow other groups to view)  \n19:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:24\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:03\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:03\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:05\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:05\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:14\u00a0<marcules>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<marcules>\u00a0has quit  \n22:08\u00a0<raphael29\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n22:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:26\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:29\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:40\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:41\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:46\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n22:46\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:18\u00a0<OSIMasson1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:27\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n23:38\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:40\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
