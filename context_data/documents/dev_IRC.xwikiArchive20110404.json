I have a question regarding XEM. After installing it, I want to create a default template. But it seems I am not able to control the database name which is created automatically by the XEM when installing the default template. This basically makes impossible to use 2 XEM's on the same machine, because the default template used will be shared among the two instances (because both will seek for the default template). Any idea what can I  \n11:18\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0\u00a0do ?  \n11:20\u00a0<@cjdelisl1>\u00a0run 2 mysqld's on different ports?  \n11:20\u00a0<aravindbhms\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:21\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, but I don't think this will solve the issue.  \n11:23\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I mean, I am on a 2.7.1 XEM and creating a default template, which is hardcoded and named templatexe. Then, I go on a 3.0 XEM and create the default template. I guess the 3.0 will override the 2.7.1 or see it as already existing. And I'm not sure that creating a subwiki on 2.7.1 will not actually instantiate a 3.0 XE because of the template  \n11:23\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I think the best person to ask this is Thomas  \n11:40\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0has quit  \n11:40\u00a0<cjdelisl1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:40\u00a0<npm\\_\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:40\u00a0<jamesxu>\u00a0has quit  \n11:42\u00a0<bark>\u00a0has quit  \n11:43\u00a0<npm\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:43\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:43\u00a0<shanaka>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:47\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0re git, submodules in xwiki-trunks are using SSH endpoints.

That seems like a complicated way to go.  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I agree  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm replying to sdumitriu  \n12:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If there was one person in charge of saying yes or no to everything then it would make sense.  \n12:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But with a group of committers it's a bit redundant.  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've heard people do C but I don't like too much for the following reasons:  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* It means finding a developer to review every time which IMO is going to either be very hard to do or that developer will simply approve it without really reviewing the code  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* It means the master branch will be slow to have the latest changes which means our CI tests won't run as often on them (only close to release dates) which is bad and will make code integration harder  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* Side note: Even though Git encourages developers to keep their work locally without sharing them we should \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* do this and developers should continue to commit every day and not keep code on their machines. This prevents code integration and code reviews. It's easy to casually review 15 lines of code, it's very hard to review 300 lines of code!  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\* Since mails (and diff mails) will continue to be sent code reviews will still be done as before. This is lazy code reviewing and is IMO much better than forced code reviews which I don't see working. It would be a good strategy if we were building a software to send man to Mars for example but for XWiki I favor a lazy code reviewing approach (what we've been \u00a0doing).  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0So 1A for me.  \n12:11\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok lunch time  \n12:12\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0heh I thought at first that was a complaint about the C language.  \n12:13\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n12:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0My thinking is just that git is just a different SCM.
