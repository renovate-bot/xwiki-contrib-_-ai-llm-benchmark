I am upgrading from 1.6 to 1.7.1 and the database schema has changed. I have gone into the xwiki.cfg and enabled the migration options for hibernate based schema updates and it fails.  \nDSpair - (20/01/2009 15:10): Specifically, when I try to load the initial page I get: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: column xwikidocum0\\_.xwd\\_hidden does not exist  \nDSpair - (20/01/2009 15:11): That is the root exception.  \nasyd - (20/01/2009 15:11): have you some messages about the version of storage?  \nDSpair - (20/01/2009 15:11): Would that be in the tomcat logs or the xwiki.log?  \nasyd - (20/01/2009 15:12): tomcat logs  \nDSpair - (20/01/2009 15:13): No, I do not see anything there.  \nDSpair - (20/01/2009 15:14): Oh wait, grep to the rescue: \u00a0[http-8080-Processor24] INFO \u00a0.AbstractXWikiMigrationManager \u00a0- No storage migration required since current version is [7351]  \nDSpair - (20/01/2009 15:16): Let me retry by loading a clean copy of the database from backup.  \nDSpair - (20/01/2009 15:19): I've been migrating this database since about 1.2. Is there a way to manually set the db version number in order to force a migration? Would that seriously break anything?  \nxwikibot - (20/01/2009 15:34): Design.OfficeConverter was modified by xwiki:XWiki.asiri - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/OfficeConverter  \nDSpair - (20/01/2009 15:35): Woohoo!!!
