I have it in the Add Extensions list  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it's also an extension  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0EM doesn't know what is installed without EM  \n17:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ATM)  \n17:37\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it's confusing for end users  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne is working on that  \n17:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to recognize XE as a set of extensions  \n17:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cool  \n17:40\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0for example ATM is hard to internationalize an extension, right ? because you have to manually add translation bundles in admin section, right ?  \n17:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: it's jquery-1.7.1.min.js that causes the trouble. If I comment it I don't have any issue and if I leave it and comment all the other JS it fails  \n17:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: I think that both libraries define observe(), but with different arguments  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://drafts.workingdemo.com/2011/01/migrating-prototype-to-jquery/  \n17:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(shows the difference between both frameworks)  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems jquery uses bind instead of observe  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking jquery js code  \n17:58\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I don't see observe in http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.js  \n18:01\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0that's for sdumitriu  \n18:01\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ah, no, I'm confusing with the extjs conflict  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ah indeed  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(thought it was you talking earlier ;))  \n18:02\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Sorry for the red herring  \n18:02\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np, any help is welcome  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see we have an extension on e.x.o for using jquery but I guess it has the same problem  \n18:03\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so if it works without jquery-1.7.1-min.js what is the problem?  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: this is jquery so without it nothing much will get done ;)  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fullcalendar is using jquery  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I said \"work\" I meant the xwiki tab at the bottom  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that was to find which js was causing the problem  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's jquery-1.7.1 js....  \n18:05\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ah, ok, I though that the 'no conflict' thing is provided in a separate file, but it comes with jquery  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the other js are protected against the $ issue so nofonclit is not even needed  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fonclit-->conflict  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(AFAICS)  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've read somewhere that prototype does pretty bad things  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like override native functions  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like getElementByTagName  \n18:06\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No, it doesn't  \n18:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it enhances existing objects  \n18:07\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0with new methods  \n18:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me find the thread I was reading  \n18:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It defines some methods when they don't exist, for legacy browsers  \n18:07\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Usually the way that happens is that Prototype was first to use that function, but later it was added in a JS specification  \n18:08\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0In that case prototype will deprecate that function name, use a new name and only provide the old function name when the browser doesn't have it  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-conflicts-with-prototype-and-the-fix  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"HTMLElement.prototype.getElementsByClassName is overwritten by prototype.js and it uses $ which is overwritten by jQuery. The result is that jQuery can't finish initializing and prototype is also left broken.\"  \n18:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0if (!document.getElementsByClassName) document.getElementsByClassName = function(instanceMethods){  \n18:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0So indeed it does define getElementsByTagName, but only when the browser doesn't have it  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm seems that the jquery helper extension works fine  \n18:13\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0(but that only happens in ancient browsers, I don't think it's the reason why you're having trouble)  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's using jquery 1.7.2  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll try using that  \n18:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: rendeirng-archetype-macro has the same problem  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie 3.5-SNAPSHOT)  \n18:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on 3.5.1  \n18:26\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0K  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: do you know what defer=false does in: $xwiki.jsx.use(\"jQuery.jQuery\", {'defer': false}) ?  \n18:30\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It doesn't defer the script, which means that it will be executed as soon as the <script> tag is parsed  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:31\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Defered scripts will be downloaded in the background and will be executed before the dom:loaded event is sent  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok , I remember now  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n\n"}
