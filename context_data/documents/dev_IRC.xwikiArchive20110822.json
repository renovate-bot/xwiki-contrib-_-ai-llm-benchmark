WYSIWYG editing does not seem to work very well with lines containing links. If I cut a line with a link to an uploaded file and paste it elsewhere, it does not seem to work afterwards... in fact it seems quite screwed up. Probably have to delete the link and regen it...  \n07:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n07:36\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Looking at it in 'source' I found the lines I moved had their 'attach' changed to http. Fixed one of them by editing but repairing the other still seems to be evading me...  \n07:37\u00a0<amon>\u00a0This is going to be messy for people who are writers and not computer systems folk.  \n08:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good morning  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm I wonder how thomas is going to be the build manager for this week when he's on holidays....  \n09:45\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm lots of failing tests\u2026. several due to sergiu and marta's changes over the week end I believe  \n09:47\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:17\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I'm unable to deploy a jar to maven.xwiki.org externals. I have this on my pom http://pastebin.com/YpsipwxU and my setting.xml has http://pastebin.com/1ZtNMnQK .

I can ssh [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) . Is there something I'm missing?  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know, I haven't done it but sergiu released 3.2M2 so it should be working  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you tried doing a manual scp to see if it works?  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you enabled -X to see what happens?  \n10:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0let me try  \n11:08\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I can scp and the -X output doesn't say much http://pastebin.com/GA1jcREx . It's clearly a maven configuration issue.  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: can you try to pass the user?  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm apparently it's not possible:  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it shouldn't be needed anyway  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the ids are correct?  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes they look ok  \n11:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I don't get it, it works with scpexe and wagon-ssh-external :| but not with scp and wagon-ssh  \n11:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/examples/deploy-ssh-external.html  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0scp exe will use your scp executable  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's normal it's working  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since you said you could scp manually  \n11:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but why isn't scp + wagon-ssh working?  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0scp will use a java implementation of scp  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the issue is finding your username/key/password  \n11:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know why though  \n11:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it should find the access config in settings.xml  \n11:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0anyway, moving forward sine I don't have time to investigate more  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/460/  \n12:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0505 failures! nice score :)  \n12:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: there's no relation between annotations and my commit (office importer)  \n12:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0wait  \n12:49\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0strange, tests pass locally  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as you can see in the tests there's a component init issue  \n12:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but I don't have it locally  \n12:59\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0can you pull and build office importer locally to check?  \n12:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't matter if it build on my machine, it needs to work on the ci one  \n12:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and I'm having lunch right now\u2026 :))  \n13:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, but it helps to understand the problem  \n13:00\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n13:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0good morning (afternoont)  \n13:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0s/t//  \n13:59\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n14:08\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:34\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: we still have problems with nexus, http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-container-api/3.2-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml is inaccessible.  \n14:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0same http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-bridge/3.2-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml  \n14:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-refactoring/3.2-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml  \n14:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-core-container-api/  \n14:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-rendering-macro-gallery/3.2-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml  \n14:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it only seems to go up to 3.0  \n14:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it was probably moved  \n14:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0that's a different issue, the real problem is that maven-metadata.xml is protected  \n14:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0indeed  \n14:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-container-api/3.2-SNAPSHOT/  \n14:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0lets see if I can find anything...  \n14:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and it's not the same for all artifacts  \n14:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0maven-metadata.xml is accessible for most of them  \n15:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't think it's a case of being protected, it seems to be a real 404 error  \n15:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but it is listed  \n15:06\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0indeed, perhaps the disk drive is full or it was dropped?  \n15:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the maven-metadata.xml file  \n15:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh it's the maven box...  \n15:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0disk drive 88% used  \n15:10\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0maven@maven:~/public\\_html/snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-container-api/3.2-SNAPSHOT$ ls -la maven-metadata.xml  \n15:11\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0-rw-rw-r-- 1 maven maven 796 2011-08-22 14:45 maven-metadata.xml  \n15:12\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-container-api/3.2-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml is accessible, but http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-container-api/3.2-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml not  \n15:13\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I don't know how nexus works. Isn't Nexus using the same repo? I though Nexus is just a layer on top of a maven repo  \n15:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0why is Nexus blocking access to a file from maven repo?..  \n15:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think that is how it is configured but it might be mirroring it, checking in to it more...  \n15:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hrm  \n15:20\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I found this http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/Re-Item-not-found-for-UID-message-for-SNAPSHOT-artifacts-on-Solaris-td130685.html  \n15:22\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it might be a problem with Nexus cache and the way we deploy maven artifacts.  \n15:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there is also https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-3601  \n15:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0one of the questions was: \"is your Hudson deploying to Nexus over HTTP? Or directly to FS that backs Nexus storage?\"  \n15:35\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see that xwiki-commons pom uses maven.xwiki.org in its distribution management section, this suggests that releases are not deployed through nexus, but directly on maven.xwiki.org  \n15:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0indeed, it should be pushing to nexus otherwise the cache will not be cleared.  \n15:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n15:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but that is for releases, the issue we have now is with snapshot. I'm trying to find the place where jenkins is told where to deploy snapshots  \n15:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it's in the pom.xml  \n15:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so it's the same as for releases then  \n15:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0jenkins deploys directly to maven.xwiki.org  \n15:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0let me try deploying through nexus  \n15:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the problem is you need to have an http password  \n15:46\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep, because I need to use http put, not scp (backed by my ssh key)  \n15:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I got around this for the staging so it can be done, I just need to remember how I did it...  \n15:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: help needed  \n15:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ok agent1 has a password in the settings.xml and it's pwn username  \n15:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0we just need to add usernames/passwords for the other 3 agents and change the deploy method to http  \n15:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, and all committers needs to update their settings.xml  \n15:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0we need to update http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/ReleaseProcess too  \n15:54\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0no because committers shouldn't be pushing to the repo  \n15:54\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you need to do it sometimes  \n15:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0at least for external deps  \n15:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0for instance I have to deploy a custom build of jodconverter to externals  \n15:55\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0For special cases you can add artifacts to maven manually then flush the cache if need be.  \n15:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I see  \n15:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I guess that will work  \n15:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you need to push things to nexus periodically then IMO you should have a username with it.  \n15:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but this means we'll do the release only from the hudson machine, and I remember vincent complaining about it.  \n15:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0well, he actually complained that we use the same username to access the machine  \n16:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yea it's kind of a catch22, it would be nice to have a username per committer per machine, then that would mean a lot of users with nexus... \u00a0cjdelisle-agent1 cjdelisle-agent2 etc etc etc.  \n16:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep..  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we could decide to at last use staging as we should be using  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then promote from staging to our release repo  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re externals, nexus has the UI to upload an artifact  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all that said I'm not sure about the \"cache\" issue you mention  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I haven't read on it though so I'm not sure how that works)  \n16:14\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0right now we're deploying snapshots to maven.xwiki.org instead of doing it through nexus  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't have to go through nexus AFAIK  \n16:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think what's happening is when an artifact is build on an agent other than agent1 it doesn't use the http upload, it uses scp because I forgot to add the http upload to commons pom.xml and only added it to agent1's properties.xml.  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see why we would have to do that  \n16:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1584763/how-do-i-deploy-to-nexus-hosted-by-secureci  \n16:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\"Having that said, I don't think that scp is the way to go with Nexus. If you deploy using scp, Nexus won't be notified of the deployment and your artifacts won't be visible\"  \n16:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh nope agent1 is using scp too, it only uses http for staging.  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know how often nexus refreshed its cache  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/refreshed/refreshes/  \n16:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it's set to 1440 minutes  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm you sure it's the right setting? I thought it was the remote repo sync setting  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hecking  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it could be the same setting  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case this is configurable  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we could lower the value for repos hosted on the FS  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reading http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/config-sect-manage-repo.html  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"If Nexus fails to locate an artifact, it will cache this result for a given number of minutes. In other words, if Nexus can't find an artifact in a remote repository, it will not repeated attempt to resolve this artifact until the Not Found Cache TTL time has been exceeded. The default for this setting is 1440 minutes (or 24 hours).\"  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should we put 1 minute?  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the snapshot repo  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki snapshot repo I mean  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n16:25\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0let's see how it works  \n16:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0My thinking is this: \"If you don't want surprises from nexus then don't surprise nexus by chainging things on it's filesystem.\"  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have quite a lot of exceptions in nexus logs btw  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: it's a good thinking but we need to agree all together first that we want to do all our repo operations through nexus  \n16:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0FWIW I'm +1 to the idea, I'd like it better if it was FOSS software but it's usefull and that is good. OTOH if we can put this off then we can get myxwiki updated sooner :)  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n16:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I can start looking at that as soon as my key is on the box.  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: did you fix the platform test issue btw?  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(was it related to this discussion?)  \n16:31\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, it was related.
