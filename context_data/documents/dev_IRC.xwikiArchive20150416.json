There are two main issues: (1) Clicking on the \"Continue\" button with Selenium has no effect sometimes (very hard to reproduce) and (2) The extension is not found anymore in the repo after clicking on the Install/Uninstall/etc. button. I will try to make some time to investigate these tests again.  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ok thanks  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should I continue with the release?  \n16:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0+1 on my side  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:47\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:36\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grrr build failure on 6.4.x  \n18:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand why ci passed on platform for 6.4.x  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm was passing at http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform-6.4.x/  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh I know  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's bad actually  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: is that you who removed the checkstyle from the main jobs?  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*checkstyle checks  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember if it was thomas or you  \n18:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: I don`t remember doing such thing  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then it must have been thomas  \n18:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:15\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:23\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh great\u2026  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems someone has fixed the agent build  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when building a bugfix release  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the pom seems to contain the correct version!  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me check git history to see who did this  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n19:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleasePlans/ReleasePlanHelp#HBuildtherelease hasn't been updated though  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I don't see anything  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok found it  \n19:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done by thomas :)  \n19:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in rev ab6a3317a4a318bb07c546a8ee1e27e72102d6fc  \n19:31\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0hey, in a wiki article i have the text \"(n)\" with xwiki translates into a thumbs down icon, i tried escaping the parentheses with ~, but it doesnt seem to work  \n19:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tekzilla: you can use {{{(n)}}} in XWiki syntax 2.0+  \n19:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{{\u2026}}} is verbatim  \n19:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0other option is to disable emoticons  \n19:48\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:48\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0vmassol: that did it, thanks!  \n19:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool  \n19:54\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:13\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n21:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<Bugen\\_do>\u00a0has quit  \n22:30\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:40\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:43\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:51\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:04\u00a0<MasterPiece>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit\n"}
