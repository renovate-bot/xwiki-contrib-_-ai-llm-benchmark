I'll find one for you  \ndaning - (10/09/2008 08:29): vmassol: OK.  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 08:35): daning: ok found one. I'm sending it by mail to you now  \ndaning - (10/09/2008 08:35): vmassol: OK.  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:43): mflorea: hi. could you tell your status for the wysiwug editor in 1.6M2?  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 09:51): vmassol: I just fixed some minor IE bugs (tool bar separator was not shown and disabled icons looked like they were enabled) and I added the Insert Symbol feature, which uses the new dialog (the one that will be used for the next features). Marcela is working for the Tray and I'm working for extending the control over the editor with selection capabilities. This is required for the next features. Without it I cannot access the current DOM n  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 09:51): ode, I cannot move the cursor, and so on. The main problem we have right now is that we don't have a final-usable desing for the UI  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:52): mflorea: does it mean we haven't fixed the paragrpah issue for 1.6M2?  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:53): (and the bold/italices/etc issues)  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 09:53): nop. I can't fix this without getting the current selection  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:54): mflorea: so could you please make sure to add the known issues to the release notes when JV creates them later today to ensure our users know about them?  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 09:54): right now I cannot determine the place I'm editing in the DOM so I can't do changes to the DOM, like wrap the current node with some tag, insert something before  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:55): we have 1 week to fix all these before the 1.6RC1 release....  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:55): it's going to be tight  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:55): but we need to make it  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:55): :)  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 09:55): for the paragraph issues I have to get the selection, get the DOM node from the selection and wrap that node into a p tag  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 09:56): (RC1 is meant to be a final release and there shouldn't be a RC2 normally)  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 09:59): vmassol: I know. I'm working for the selection thing right now. This will help me fix some bug and prepare new features. But one problem I have is that Marcela can't work on the UI because the desing is not ready and usable yet. I have my fault here because I didn't reviewed the design at the right time, but I haven't had that much time..  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:01): vmassol: have you received my last message?  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:02): mflorea: no sorry  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:02): vmassol: I know. I'm working for the selection thing right now. This will help me fix some bug and prepare new features. But one problem I have is that Marcela can't work on the UI because the desing is not ready and usable yet. I have my fault here because I didn't reviewed the design at the right time, but I haven't had that much time..  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:02): mflorea: what do you need to make the design \"usable\"?  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:03): (just your time or someone's else time too?)  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:05): take for instance this dialog http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Design/NewWysiwygEditorInterface/WYSIWYG.zip/WYSIWYG.003.png  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:09): Instead of using expanded lists I think we should use filterable comboboxes. It takes less space. But then I don't know a good solution for creating just a link to a wiki, without filling the space or page. But even with lists, the final column (Anchors) is not clear. There is an Attachments entry and Attachment-5.odp at the same time.  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:11): Marcela is not a UI expert, and neither am I. I can spend time and try to improve the desing but then I won't have time for other things like selection management and server-side services for future features  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:16): mflorea: so you need some time from Guillaume it seems  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:16): so, considering the current status I don't think we'll have new features like insert link and insert image in RC1. I'd rather focus this week on fixing bugs so that what we have right now works perfectly on the main browsers.  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:16): for me this table should be the same as our dynamic table  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:16): yes  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:17): actually not the same but close  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:17): hmm, I don't see it as a table  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:17): not the same since each column is separated   \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:17): yes you're right  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:17): but I mean the same in term of:  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:17): - auto completion  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:17): right  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:17): - vertical sliders  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:18): we can probably reuse what we have  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:18): and make it 4 tables with 1 column each  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:19): but I personally like to see the elements without a combo box  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:19): hmm, I don't know about reuse, since I'm writing java code and I guess the current code is js based on prototype or other js framework  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:21): ah right, I tend to forget about this...  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:21): mflorea: I've asked guillaume to talk to you  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:21): and to help you  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:21): we need to have a first version for 1.6 final  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:21): but anyway, I just gave you an example of a dialog that needs to be worked out.  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:22): ok, I'll talk with him  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:22): first version = something that works and that is close to the final design   \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:22): it doesn't need to have all features of course  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:22): but the ones that are there should 1) work as much as possible and 2) look close to the final design  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:24): thomasmortagne: \"(same feature than \"old\" {table} macro for now)\". Except for functions I guess ;)  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:25): thomasmortagne: you have a bug in your expect for xwiki syntax. A newline should not be added at the end  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:25): (but you probably know it, maybe you can comment it in the file in that case as a todo using .# xxxx)  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:26): (same for the xhtml input which is skipped so that we know what the pb is)  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 10:38): vmassol: where can I get the latest snapshot of XE?  \nthomasmortagne - (10/09/2008 10:38): vmassol: yes I know for newline at the end of table, I have to had some stack state to not add the last newline, I just let this for latter  \nthomasmortagne - (10/09/2008 10:41): vmassol: yes forgot functions, I need to find clean a way to determine that it's functions...  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:42): thomasmortagne: I think we should leave them for later  \nvmassol - (10/09/2008 10:43): (and focus on the rest first instead)  \nthomasmortagne - (10/09/2008 10:43): vmassol: yes sure  \namelentev - (10/09/2008 10:54): vmassol, thomasmortagne: about XTXMLDOC-7: should I add role-hint=default to all my components?  \namelentev - (10/09/2008 10:54): according plexus docs, null should work too.  \nthomasmortagne - (10/09/2008 10:54): amelentev: I guess yes  \nthomasmortagne - (10/09/2008 10:55): (was answering for \"default\" not null :))  \namelentev - (10/09/2008 10:55): :)  \namelentev - (10/09/2008 10:56): ok. adding  \nthomasmortagne - (10/09/2008 10:56): ok thanks  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 14:37): vmassol\\_: I'm going to start the release, can you close http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2634 ?  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:37): jvdrean: yep doing that now  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 14:37): thanks  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:39): jvdrean: done  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 14:41): WDYT about closing this one as duplicate http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2045 ?  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 14:42): vmassol\\_: no answer since jan 2008  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:42): jvdrean: is it not valid?  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:42): cannot we run native2ascii for him and apply it?  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 14:43): http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2129 as already been commited  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 14:46): vmassol\\_: sdumitriu : isn't this issue deprecated considering the ongoing work on the new rendering ? http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-2128  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:46): jvdrean: ok let's close it then. I'll let you do it  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:46): jvdrean: re the question for sergiu, the answer is no  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:46): because we need to have the same css for both renderings  \nsdumitriu - (10/09/2008 14:47): Right  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 14:47): ok, just like you did for titles during 1.6M1  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:47): for example right now in the new rendering I'm generating <ul class=\"star\">  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:47): but I'd like that to be changed to <ul>  \nsdumitriu - (10/09/2008 14:47): vmassol\\_: There are two types of lists  \njvelociter - (10/09/2008 14:47): vmassol\\_: , everybody Hi, quick question  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:47): <ol>  \nsdumitriu - (10/09/2008 14:47): \\* and -  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:48): well the new rendering doesn't support -  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:48): right now  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:48): so the question is: do we want to support it  \nsdumitriu - (10/09/2008 14:48): One is an empty circle, the other a full one  \njvelociter - (10/09/2008 14:48): A issue closed as \"Won't Fix\" should not have a \"Fix For\" version, right ?  \nsdumitriu - (10/09/2008 14:48): I don't think we should  \nsdumitriu - (10/09/2008 14:48): jvdrean: Right  \njvelociter - (10/09/2008 14:48): (rather, it should have a empty Fix For)  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:48): IMO this will be achieved  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:48): with parameters  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:48): if needed  \nsdumitriu - (10/09/2008 14:48): It should be unknown  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:48): yep  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:54): mflorea: is this useful for us: http://www.ongwt.com/post/2008/09/10/GWT-Incubator-%3A-new-drop-and-new-demonstrations ?  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 14:54): vmassol: let me see  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 14:56): vmassol: we already use the GlassPanel from the Incubator. We'll think about the other widgets when we'll need them  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:57): oh ok didn't know we were using it  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:57): mflorea: btw we need to redo the AllDocs Treeview tab so that we can reorganize spaces and documents by drag and dropping  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:57): mflorea: is there a GWT component that does this?  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 14:58): hmm, I don't know right now, I'll think about it.  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 14:58): ok keep it in your mind and if you see something like this let me know :)  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 14:58): sure  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 15:04): vmassol: I see the Tree tab already uses a special AJAX widget or something like that because it does lazy loading of subtrees. Basically we need a Tree widget that supports drag&drop over his nodes.   \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:05): mflorea: yep  \nmflorea - (10/09/2008 15:09): GWT has a tree widget but it seems it doesn't have support for drag&drop. The same with FastTree from the Incubator. Marcela found this http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dnd-tree/ We'll give it a try. But maybe the JS framework currently used in the Tree tab has support for drag&drop.   \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:21): mflorea: ok thanks  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 15:25): XWiki.lordnaikon was modified by XWiki.lordnaikon (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/lordnaikon  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 15:33): vmassol\\_: shouldn't this be closed http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XTCONFRES-22 ?  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:33): jvdrean: checking  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:34): jvdrean: closed, thanks  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 15:36): AdminGuide.Database Administration was modified by xwiki:XWiki.MartinJecny - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Database+Administration  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 15:36): only 3 projects to release for 1.6M2! (Core,XE and XTCONFRES)  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:36): hehe nice  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:36): that's one advantage of releasing often ;)  \njvdrean - (10/09/2008 15:36): hehe ;)  \nsdumitriu - (10/09/2008 15:38): But it also mean that there wasn't much done  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:43): not much in non Core and XE yes....  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:43): the rendering has progressed quite a lot for example ;)  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:46): but yes not much was done in general on core... (just checked the roadmap in jira)....  \nvmassol\\_ - (10/09/2008 15:48): to qualify: not much on various small issues/bugs  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:14): Plugins.WikiManagerPlugin was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Plugins/WikiManagerPlugin  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:15): Applications.WikiManagerApplicationDownloads was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne (Added object) - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/WikiManagerApplicationDownloads  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:15): Plugins.WikiManagerPluginDownloads was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne (Added object) - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Plugins/WikiManagerPluginDownloads  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:21): Applications.WikiManagerApplicationDownloads was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/WikiManagerApplicationDownloads  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:21): Plugins.WikiManagerPluginDownloads was modified by xwiki:XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Plugins/WikiManagerPluginDownloads  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:25): Main.Download was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Download  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:26): Main.Download was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Download  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:27): Main.ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise16M2 was modified by XWiki.jvdrean (Initial version) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesXWikiEnterprise16M2  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:31): Blog.XWikiEnterpriseManager121Released was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWikiEnterpriseManager121Released  \nxwikibot - (10/09/2008 17:33): Blog.XWikiEnterpriseManager13Released was modified by XWiki.ThomasMortagne - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWikiEnterpriseManager13Released  \n\n"}
