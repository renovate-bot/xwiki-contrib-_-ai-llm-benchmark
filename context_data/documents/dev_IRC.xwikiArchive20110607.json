 \n18:20\u00a0<npm>\u00a0web services.... but mostly for google  \n18:21\u00a0<npm>\u00a0it would be nice, to extend auth services to work w/ xwiki  \n18:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but the idea is so have an XWiki specific API/interface which is obviously based on any existing generic android REST interface  \n18:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we are not going to do a new REST tool for android, just XWiki ;)  \n18:22\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:22\u00a0<npm>\u00a0i was porting an android app using googs services to QML/QtQuick http://code.google.com/p/ytd-meego/wiki/CitizenJournalismWithYoutubeDirectForMeego -- then the elopcalypse happened at nokia and i lost a lot of motivtion...  \n18:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0a \u00a0common use case if to let XWiki developer easily write a mobile version with automatic synchronization with their XWiki application  \n18:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0another general one is to integrate to android all the new social \u00a0features comming to XWiki (friends, twitter-like etc...)  \n18:24\u00a0<npm>\u00a0my one concern is whether that's best expressed as an android app or a chrome/html5 app for a handheld/tablet  \n18:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yea this debate is not going to ends soon  \n18:26\u00a0<npm>\u00a0the former being able to more easily run on more devices, e.g. TVs  \n18:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but having a mobile skin for XWiki is another project  \n18:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0on which we are planning to work too  \n18:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but IMO it's two different use case  \n18:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the android library is not only about UI  \n18:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is a lot of use case in which it's useful without any UI at aall  \n18:27\u00a0<npm>\u00a0makes sense, esp. if you have other android app usecases in which to integrate  \n18:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when we will have a first version of the library I'm sure a lots of use case will emmerge  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0flickering storage test again: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-tests-3.1/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-storage/69/testReport/org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4/JUnit4Provider/org\\_xwiki\\_test\\_storage\\_AllTests/  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: should we ignore it till you fix it?
