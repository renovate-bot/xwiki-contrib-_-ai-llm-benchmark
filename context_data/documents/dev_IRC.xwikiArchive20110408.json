I am a final year student in Model Engineering College,Cochin,India. I have gone through the project ideas page and find the \"Calendar Application\" project very interesting. I have done work in PHP and Javascript before. I have designed 2 websites. I have installed and configured XWiki Enterprise on my system. It would be great if someone could guide me on this project.  \n06:05\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n06:31\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n06:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Not sure there is any guidance to be had.
