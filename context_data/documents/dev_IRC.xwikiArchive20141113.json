 \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0instead of frgzmetning them  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just add a botlet as a wiki page on xwiki.org  \n09:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0tell you what, you get the xwiki bot to do that and then I'll ask him to remove the bot  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you'll get new commands  \n09:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'm not going to spend \\*my\\* time reinventing things which exist now  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what does it do? just remember things? that's very basic  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki also does remember things you put in wiki pages  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0#wastingtime  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah my point  \n09:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's a supybot http://ubottu.com/supydocs/supybot-docs/  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how does that help the xwiki project?  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(there are plenty of bots around there)  \n09:28\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it helps because I don't have to ferrit out links every time someone asks how to install  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then why not do this in xwiki land?  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I already did something similar  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0!search installation  \n09:29\u00a0<forkbot>\u00a0vmassol: There were no matching configuration variables.  \n09:29\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0because it's reinventing supybot!  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grrr  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you even hijacked our bot!  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0here you go  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't have to remember anything  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be very easy to add a new learn command too  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would take 5-10 lines of wiki script  \n09:30\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0you're trying to reinvent everything and using \"don't reinvent everything\" as the argument, this is just bizarre  \n09:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but if you want the bot out of here, I'll ask the guy to remove it  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't invent anything again, I 've used pircbot, the only specicic things I did is the xwiki part  \n09:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0pircbot is not a bot, it's an irc library  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know the guy you're talking about, nobody knows him in ths project, we don't know how many years he's going to maintain his infrz for the xwikiproject, etc  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if that guy ants to help xwiki  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then he should introduce himself  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on the list  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and explain what he's interested in doing  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pircbot is a bot  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just need to start it  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway our bot wraps pircbot  \n09:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I asked him to remove it, I don't want to talk about this anymore because it's just making me angry  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could at least have explained what you wanted to do\u2026  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you just barge in with spam  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no explanation  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using some other tool that does something very very similar to a tool we already use  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that makes me cruious  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*curious  \n09:38\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I don't understand how similar because I don't understand how to do the same thing with bots that are already here  \n09:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0woshilapin: there's some doc here : http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/IRC+Bot+Application  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it lists existing features  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but also how to add new commands  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0( http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/IRC+Bot+Application#HAddinganewBotListener )  \n09:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, but why reinventing the wheel  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we agree :)  \n09:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And there is not such thing like \"alias\" or \"learn\"  \n09:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0in the xwiki bot  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0where do you store the data?  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do you maintain it?  \n09:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0We don't maintain Java  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do you control who sees it?  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how do you control who adds data there?  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0java?  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wtf?  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need an infra  \n09:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I mean if we're don't want to use external components to develop, we should recode Java, Eclipse and all the library  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to run a bot  \n09:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0It's a non sense to ask \"how do you maintain it\"  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're missing the point  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0woshilapin: you say that because you psend 0% of your time helping out maintaining xwiki.org  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you were you'd know it's not free  \n09:43\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, and somebody is doint it for us here  \n09:43\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Anyway, I think you already made your point clear  \n09:43\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0My only surprise here is  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I already emtnioned that if some guy/company is willing to make some infra offer, they should introduce themselves  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least we should know who they are  \n09:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0It would be cool to accept things even if not perfect and learn how to improve later (take over the bot, stores data, involve the guy in the comunity)  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm +1 for that, but explain what you're doing at least  \n09:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Maybe in 2 weeks, nobody use this bot and it will die before we loose 3 weeks to make it work as you tell  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I still don'tknow what's your use case and that bot is doing except giving links)  \n09:46\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0One function is alias  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if you're doing your experiment here instead of in a private channel it means you want everyone to participate  \n09:46\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Other function is telling somebody something when he is not connected to IRC  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, any use case in mind?  \n09:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Remove Skype ?  \n09:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0:-)  \n09:47\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(for asynchroneous messages I mean)  \n09:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm\u2026 this is irc not skype\u2026  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the xwiki projec tis not using skype  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure what you mean...  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah I see  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0being able to send offline messages  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we did an experiment on this here a few years ago  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using jabber servers  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it never really worked, possibily becaue the jabber servers we used had memory issues...  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0other problem is flooding  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you connect back  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you get all the messages you didn't see  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the way we solved this issue so far is by logging everything in this channel  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and making that visible at http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/WebHome  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(using our irc bot)  \n09:51\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes but I don't think it completely solve the problem  \n09:51\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Because if I reconnect, I will not go against the whole archive to see what I missed  \n09:52\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(I say \"me\", maybe people do it?)  \n09:52\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0But yes, it's a partial solution indeed  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I do it from time to tiem  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's not that bad  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's even probably a good thing  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that we loose memory)  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because important things should not be discussed on irc and should go on the list  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you can still point people to past discussions  \n09:53\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, ok but here, it's for personal messages  \n09:54\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Do you use personal messages on IRC in the context of IRC?  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah for personal things it's different I agree  \n09:54\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I know I do a lot but maybe people don't work like that  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't use IRC for that, I find it a very bad tool  \n09:54\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, but you use Skype instead?  \n09:54\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I suppose people contact in private sometimes...  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it just works everywhere)  \n09:55\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0So you have a need for private messages and the asynchroneous functionality is good  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and most people use itknow how to use it\u2026 now ask your mom to use IRC ;)  \n09:56\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Of course but here is for devs I think, not for my mom or yours (or am I missing a point ?)  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the point is that skype is ubiquitous  \n09:57\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes I know but not open (maybe I'm too extremist) :-)  \n09:58\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And by the way, it's not ideal on Linux  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah I don't know about that, I'm lucky to be on mac and it works well  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but I do discuss with lots of people on linux with skyoe and it seems to work)  \n09:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Mac is not open too (I'm getting into a troll here so we should stop right away)  \n09:59\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0:-P  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't care about open/not open personally, all I want is the best tool for the job  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if the best is open then great  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I can help make the best open tool then even better :)  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(hence xwiki)  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I'm not going to fight on all fronts  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I win 10% productivity more with a non open tool and thus get that 10% into xwiki (an open tool) then I'm happy  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm probably a pragmatic\u2026  \n10:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0friday is tomorrow :P  \n10:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0woshilapin: http://lib.ru/DPEOPLE/PARKINSON/parkinson.txt  \n10:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0vmassol: you might find that an interesting book too  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n10:27\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0woshilapin: make sure to use references instead of full URLs when you can in links (this allows to support automatic renames)  \n10:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I was not sure how to do it since it's a different wiki  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wiki:space.page  \n10:43\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, I know that but I used [[documentation>>extension:Extension.IRC Bot Application]] and didn't work  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0would be awesome if we could auto transform external links into internal links automaitcally btw  \n10:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I did a typo or something is completely wrong?
