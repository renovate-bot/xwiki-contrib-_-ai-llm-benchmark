I'm currently getting Tomcat 403 (Access to the specified resource has been forbidden) for /xwiki/tmp/officeviewer/ context paths on 9.1.2 as a user that has access to that required resources. Thanks  \n09:43\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: I don't remember any recent change (I mean not in the past few years)  \n09:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0VincentMassol[m]: hmm, it was definitely working on8.x version and there weren't any changes in tomcat settings (and actually the /xwiki/tmp was treated as cache for some reason, so that must have changed recently)  \n09:48\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0and seems it's same as XWIKI-14176  \n09:59\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:12\u00a0<floflobel>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0(in meeting)  \n11:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:57\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:59\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<Jan\\_\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<Jan\\_\\_>\u00a0Greetings!  \n15:08\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0good day  \n15:09\u00a0<Jan\\_\\_>\u00a0Would someone have the kindness guiding me through the installation process of the LDAP extension?
