 \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just seen your commit)  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok seen the jira now  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which confirms what I thought...)  \n15:07\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes vmassol... my mistake obviously :|  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's a lesson for not having tests\u2026.  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: can you please update the Release notes for 3.2RC1  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n15:08\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, yes, but what should I say? that it's actually available from 3.2 final?  \n15:09\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0in a warning macro?  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes to both  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we need some tests to prove that it works  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(maybe manual for now but automated as soon as the app is in the platform)  \n15:11\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I did some manual testing, obviously... but I rushed with the final changes and did not get to test it all over.  \n15:11\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0anyway, will be more carefull  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in practice we should refuse any commit that odesn't have automated tests  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's degrading our quality level and not following our practices, it's also preventing others devs to touch the code  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since you're too worried about breaking something without tests)  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's also reducing our global TPC score  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not jsut commenting for you eddy, but for all of us)  \n15:13\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0of course  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think we've been very lenient on tests lately  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: you're ready for politics\u2026:) \u00a0\u00a0\" incomplete transfer process\"\u2026. wtf? \u00a0;)  \n15:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, I did call it a bug at the end :)  \n15:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah  \n15:23\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and it was a... transfer process :)  \n15:23\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0anyway :P  \n15:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: need some help understanding why the AS is displayed below instead of to the right on xwiki.org, for ex: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/VincentMassol  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(note: I haven't checked if it's a problem of 3.1.1 but on 3.1 it doesn't do this, nor on 3.2)  \n15:26\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so, about sorin`s request, it should be testable now, if the snapshot build of the component is used instead of the RC1 version.  \n15:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:19\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0vmassol: fixed  \n16:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: thanks!  \n16:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I guess it was xwikiorg issue and not a general one, cool  \n16:32\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0yes ... it was a rule I defined  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n17:00\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: we now have a scm macro to use on xwiki.org  \n17:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Macros/SCM  \n17:54\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so it's hardcoded to use github?  \n17:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the idea is that when we swtich scm we don't have to change the links  \n17:55\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I see  \n17:55\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0ok, will use it  \n17:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: right now yes the only hardcoded part is http://github.com/ basically  \n17:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but the main idea was that you use this and if ever we move xwiki elsewhere you don't have to change the page  \n17:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0just the macro  \n17:56\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yep, makes sense  \n17:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0need to make the first part configurable instead of in the code to be able to publish it in extension.xwiki.org as a generic scm macro  \n17:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sometime...  \n17:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't wait too much or you'll never do it :)  \n18:13\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:17\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:39\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has quit  \n18:41\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:47\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:49\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:54\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now deleted pages appear on irc :)  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0created ones too  \n19:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and now modified pages have a diff link :)  \n19:18\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:21\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:22\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:00\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:30\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:03\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:03\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n23:00\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n23:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:48\u00a0<lpereira>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
