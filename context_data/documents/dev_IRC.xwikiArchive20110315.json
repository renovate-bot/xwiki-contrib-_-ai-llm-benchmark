Is it normal ? IMO it should. Because if someone clicks on the old name, it will get the page that states that the page has been deleted.  \n11:47\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0isn't the AS recording it as a delete (old name) and add (new name)?  \n11:47\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0something to consider is that on the web you never want to rename a page without providing a \"30x page moved\" http header in response to requests for the old page  \n11:48\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0yeah, the auto referrer would be very nice, imo  \n11:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0jstoldt: it's recording only the delete page event  \n11:49\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a030x page moved has nothing to do with activity stream in any case  \n11:49\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0not the created page event. So from AS you can't go to the new page  \n11:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0can't even see it was renamed, because only deleted icon appears.  \n11:50\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i see... well, its been a while since i've actually worked with XWiki now ;)  \n11:50\u00a0<+cjdelisle>\u00a0yes, it was just something that came to mind  \n11:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0IMO it's inconsistent  \n11:50\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0sburjan: you should check if a JIRA exists and report it if not  \n11:50\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0we've talked about it already  \n11:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, I'm gonna look  \n11:51\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0having a \"page renamed\" event  \n11:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0to be honest, i don't like the concept of add new, remove old to boot with...  \n11:51\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0it struck me a little odd all the time i used XWiki  \n11:52\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, Raluca reported it  \n11:53\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0not just that but also not putting the old page to removed pages...  \n11:53\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0even if it's not the same scenario  \n11:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0gonna report it  \n11:57\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0is sergio going to join soonish?  \n11:58\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anybody got a clue?  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jstoldt: he'll be here in about 1-2 hours I'd say  \n12:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, cool. thakns  \n12:03\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0\\*thanks  \n12:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelociter: are you working on fixing the \"enter\" keypress for the search?
