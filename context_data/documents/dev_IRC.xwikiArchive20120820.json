I don't remember ever seeing it as an option  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0been there for years  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome#History  \n10:41\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I'll try deleting those versions and see what happens...  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:42\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0heh I was able to delete one version but not the other  \n10:44\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0had to delete my rollback version before I could delete the one before it  \n11:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is there a way (I think not) to have a subwiki that is viewable by guest but which doesn't take into account users created on the main wiki (ie it treats them as guests)?  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(trying to solve http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKIORG-35 )  \n11:31\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: not sure you should go that way to solve your issue or it will really work, but there maybe some hack possible though LDAP auth without try\\_local or exclusion  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: IMO the real solution is to have a separate instance but the only issue is that it's more costly in term of maintenance  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's still probably the best way  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdyt?  \n11:34\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0is it really an issue to edit the playground with an authenticated user ?  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not the issue  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or do you mean to forbid registration on playground?  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now the issue is that we don't want spam on xwiki.org  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it dosn't work that well though as you can just see above ;)  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a lot of those people registering don't do anything useful with xwiki.org (some do though to comment for ex)  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/lhj0516 looks like a spam user  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's sure that making everyone register on xwiki.org is the simplest  \n11:41\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0what you explains on the way registration should work could only be done with an ldap registration  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok, but anyway I don't think this is the right solution  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the right solution is either:  \n11:42\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but this will not help, since this needs some \"outside\" registration and an ldap server, which does not ease maintenance  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- keep playground in the farm and make everyone register on main wiki  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- move playgrond out of the farm  \n11:43\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0To avoid playground to be an open door on the rest, I see the second as better  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that was my reasoning too  \n11:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0keep xwiki.org reg for people who want to contribute  \n11:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we could do too is to remove playground.xwiki.org and instead have only playground.myxwiki.org,the reason we haven't done it is because we wantes a stable playground  \n11:44\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not sure this is needed  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if playground is out of the farm then playground.xwiki.org is a bit misleading for users who might think it's part of the same farm  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(this is what the guy is saying)  \n11:45\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I agree  \n11:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0btw, yesterday I was looking at xwiki-platform-chat, and on ML, you tell your hopes to see it as an extension but there is a big issue, it needs to add some servlets\u2026 What are the plan about extension that would like to add servlets ?  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they shouldn't  \n11:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no reason to require a servlet  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(btw another answer is servlet 3.0)  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but they shouldn't)  \n11:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure, 3.0 would be a solution, but it is far too early  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since they won't get init code which almost always lead to bugs)  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0inetgration should be done with components, no servletrs  \n11:50\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I am a little bit afraid by the potential load increase due to initialization code while playing with no latency messaging  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if they user servlet it means they'll bring their own config, etc, which isn't a nice integration (a nice integration would use xwiki properties)  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(xwiki-configuration I mean)  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes of course there are some edge cases  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was talking generally speaking  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like for REST integration  \n11:50\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0sure, I fully agree with you  \n11:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is currently bad)  \n11:51\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I am here talking about these edge cases, like supporting BOSH and WebSockets communications  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I'd say they're not extensions till we move to servlet 3.0  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well they are extensions  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not installable extensions with EM  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0type = other  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well they can still be installed with EM but will require some manual changes too  \n11:52\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0would not this one in particular integrate the core ?  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0BOSH/WebSockets?  \n11:53\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0at least a good way to help do so  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure, could be a good idea, would need to see what it means exactly  \n11:54\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0in fact, it depends, but it is mainly introducing statefull connections  \n11:55\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0(imo, BOSH is just a fallback to missing WebSockets)  \n11:57\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0also, looking more wide, having an integrated XMPP server, is even better, since it also ensure all the session, presence, grouping and message synchronizations you need for live collaboration  \n11:58\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so more, that just WebSockets, should not we look at embedding vysper in the core ?  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know this domain well, will need to do some research to reply ;)  \n12:08\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: apart of Fabio initiative, are you aware of anything else do about live collaboration ?  \n12:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope  \n12:26\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: to get a quick idea of all you may do with XMPP, look at \u00a0http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/  \n12:27\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0and this is only standardized discussions, there is nothing that prevent proprietary extension as well  \n12:36\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:57\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: looks cool. Would be a nice GSOC topic ;)  \n14:04\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: this one http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0151.html in particular is really related to what Fabio started  \n14:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/References/UPhotoMeasure is not longer user xwiki\u2026. :(  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder how we should handle these cases  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0should we just remove the entry or keep it and mention it's no longer using xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the screenshot we took at the time is still interesting to show what could be done with xwiki I think  \n14:43\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hey 4.2M3 is at the end of the week\u2026. I hope jvdrean and tmortagne/mflorea can make it! :)  \n15:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:33\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:35\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:35\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n15:54\u00a0<ries>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:05\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0vmassol: regarding the references that no longer use XWiki, it could have a negative effect, since you obviously ask, why they leave ?  \n16:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: I fixed the platform build, there was a \"delete\" button while browsing the JBoss repository  \n16:20\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0There are a few failing attachment tests that I'm trying to fix  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ok great thanks  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: I've sent them a mail asking why they stopped using xwiki, we'll see  \n17:19\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: I don't know what to do with a test  \n17:29\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/blob/master/xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/src/test/it/org/xwiki/test/ui/AttachmentTest.java#L60  \n17:30\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's supposed to add two attachments at a time, using two file inputs  \n17:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: the test looks valid, what's your question?  \n17:36\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But the new attachment upload doesn't have more than one field, it's supposed to be multiple upload directly  \n17:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0There's no more \"Add another file\" button  \n17:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The upload is instant, once you select a file it's uploaded  \n17:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Normally, I'd just put both files in the field  \n17:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But Selenium doesn't support that yet  \n17:38\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Other are asking about uploading multiple files in Selenium  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm we need to decide if that's good or bad. So we don't support multiple uploads any more, we need to decide if we want tha to rnot  \n17:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0We do, just select more files in the dialog  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm is this supoprtedby all browsers?  \n17:39\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Instead of having to click many times on \"add another file\", then \"browse\", just select them in one dialog  \n17:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't recall being able to do that in the past  \n17:39\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's supported by all except IE, where we're using the old interface, with the \"Add\" button  \n17:40\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The HTML5 upload is active only if the browser supports it  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so indeed we need to find a way to support this in selenium. What we could do is keep the test for IE (we have an annotation for that) and write a new test for other browsers and ATM give a link to a feature request in Selenium if it's not supported  \n17:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at minimum we need to ensure we have a test for uploading with 1 file but that's probably the case)  \n17:42\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2239  \n17:43\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:47\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:12\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:19\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0cjd: Registration tests are failing, could you look into it? http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/1589/testReport/  \n19:16\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0cjd: CIA-122 doesn't report commits anymore, any idea why?  \n19:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n20:02\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:52\u00a0<vdox2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:53\u00a0<vdox2>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n23:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
