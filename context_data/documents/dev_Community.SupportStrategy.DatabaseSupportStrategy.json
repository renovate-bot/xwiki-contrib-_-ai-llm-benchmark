Currently tested: . | MySQL has been replaced by MariaDB in all Debian and most of the Linux distributions, and is thus going to be used more and more (especially when building an open source stack) |\n| MySQL | [Latest + LTS version strategy](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SupportStrategy/LatestLTSDefinition/). Currently tested: . | MySQL is one of the most used open source database. |\n| PostgreSQL | [Latest + LTS version strategy](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SupportStrategy/LatestLTSDefinition/). Currently tested: . | PostgreSQL is also one of the most used database (especially when building an open source stack) |\n| Oracle | [Latest + LTS version strategy](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/SupportStrategy/LatestLTSDefinition/). Currently tested: . | Being an enterprise wiki, XWiki also supports Oracle to be \"business\"-friendly |\n\n# Databases that are not supported\n\nThe following databases are not officially supported. XWiki may work with them, completely or partly. We don't constantly test against it, we don't ensure that new features work on them. However whenever someone raises an issue on [JIRA](https://jira.xwiki.org) about them and it's easy to fix (or if someone provides a patch) then we fix it.\n\nNote that we use Hibernate for our persistence and thus if the database you wish to use is supported by Hibernate you should be able to make it work in XWiki. However it may require tuning some Hibernate HBM files\n\n\n\n| Database |\n| --- |\n| H2 |\n| IBM DB2 Database |\n| Microsoft SQL Server |\n| Apache Derby |\n\nYou can [Search the XWiki mail archive](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/MailingLists) to see all discussion threads about the Database you're interested in.\n\n\n"}
