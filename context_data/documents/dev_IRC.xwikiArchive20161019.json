I'm asking because I'd like to do that for the dashboard macro, see http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9583?focusedCommentId=93128&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-93128 ) ?  \n11:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it depends what is inside this macro, when you execute the macro content you don't respect order at the general page level  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes indeed  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the case the of dahsboard gadgets it could be a good thing actually  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to isolate them from the rest of the page)  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and from each other)  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if something need to be isolated it should be executed as such (not with the rest of the document XDOM around it)  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so I could actually be fixing a bug here :)  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now I could also break existing usages but that seems unlikely  \n11:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0dashboard gadget don't seems like the kind of use case that need to look at the rest of the document  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n11:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if they do they should probably macros instead of gadgets  \n12:05\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0, that executes the macro transformation (vs ContentParser which doesn't). Signature will be: XDOM parse(String content, Syntax syntax, MacroTransformationContext macroContext) + the sig with EntityReference. WDYT?  \n12:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: then you should call the method execute and not parse  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and probably ContentExecutor instead of MacroTransformedContentParser  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes good idea  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0although it doesn't indictae that it's the macro that will be executed but that's ok I think  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*macro tx  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ContentExecutor and MacroContentExecutor  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or MacroTransformationContentExecutor)  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes actually since TxContext is generic :)  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually no it's a problem  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll use a generic  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm another point  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wanted to put it in xwiki-platform-rendering-parser with ContentParser...  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess I'll need to create yet another module\u2026  \n13:57\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:12\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:02\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<dvd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:15\u00a0<dvd>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:10\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n18:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:22\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:36\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:02\u00a0<systemd>\u00a0has quit  \n21:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:58\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n22:11\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has quit  \n23:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit\n"}
