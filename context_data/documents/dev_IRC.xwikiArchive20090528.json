I use XWikiXmlRpcClient for the communication with the xwiki server. It is necessary to create another class to make the communication protocol transparent and use that class in the whole project, or can i use \u00a0XWikiXmlRpcClient class?  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:49): Let me check a thing  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 17:50): ok  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:50): Hm...  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:50): We would need a generic API in the core for remote communication  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:50): But until that appears, you can use the client directly  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:50): It's shorter for the moment  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 17:51): ok  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:51): florinciu: Any thoughts on that?  \nflorinciu - (28/05/2009 17:53): I use an interface for the server calls that provides me some isolation from the communitation protocol. It has two implemtatations for XML-RPC and Velocity Services.   \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:54): Did you have the interface from the start?  \nflorinciu - (28/05/2009 17:54): yes  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 17:55): well for me it will be nice if I have an interface that is implemented by the XWikiXmlRpc class and the other communication classes  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:56): Yes, my point exactly  \nflorinciu - (28/05/2009 17:56): the disadvantage is that if she uses an interface then she needs to rewrite the model  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:56): But we don't have it yet  \nflorinciu - (28/05/2009 17:56): i needed that anyway since I was on another platform  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 17:57  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 17:58): maybe I should work for now with this one, in order to have something functional and when the interface is ready to change the client  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:58): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 17:58): And to make that switch easy, make sure you write a lot of tests  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 17:59): ok  \ntrifon joined #xwiki at 18:00  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 18:00  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 18:01): other question is regarding the architecture .. is it ok if I have a singleton with the client and the xwiki structure .. and to access this class from the dialog classes and so on?  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:02): I don't know how OO works with multiple documents, so I can't decide now  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:02): But I guess a singleton is OK  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:02): As long as you don't reference it from a static field, but using a static getter method  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 18:03): ok  \nrrodriguez left at 18:03 ()  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 18:04): and regarding the maven structure ..  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 18:04): what should be the version of the xoo project? 1.0 or 1.0-SNAPSHOT?  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:04): 1.0-SNAPSHOT  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:04): Snapshots change  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:04): A fixed version should always be the same  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:05): 1.0 from two days ago should be the same as 1.0 from next month  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 18:05): I see ..  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:05): Snapshots have a timestamp attached to them, so it's easy to identify each build  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:05): The fixed version gets set during the release  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:06): When doing:  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:06): mvn release:prepare  \nsdumitriu - (28/05/2009 18:06): it will ask you what version are you releasing (maven rulz)  \ncristinas - (28/05/2009 18:06): and about the dependencies ..
