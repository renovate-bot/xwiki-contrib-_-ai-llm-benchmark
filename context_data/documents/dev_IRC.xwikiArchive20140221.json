 \n10:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note: XWikiContext is not considered as Serializable even if it implement Serializable, since it practive well trying to serialize it simply does not work (a pity the Java compiler does not have stringer validation for Serializable)  \n10:18\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0or the solution is to have event listener only on one node?  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: you can check if the event is local or remote, see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Observation+Module+Remote#HCheckremoteevent  \n10:18\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0nice, thanks  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or yes you organize your \u00a0instance to have only one to deal with this  \n10:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0your call  \n11:12\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n11:13\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:13\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:45\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n12:59\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica,msmeria: just created http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XAREADER  \n13:14\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: thanks  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm going to publish http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/Deprecation+Fixing+Day+2  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone needs to update it?
