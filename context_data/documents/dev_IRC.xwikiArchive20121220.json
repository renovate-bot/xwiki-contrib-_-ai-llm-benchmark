Right now each list item explains what it does  \n09:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Denis: that's another topic  \n09:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0not really, why ?  \n09:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I talked with vmassol about remembering the last choice or having a \"apply this action to next/similar conflicts\"  \n09:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0if I compare to APT, which provide similar idea, the keyboard is really faster to the task, but not intuitive for a web page, this is why button seems to me better  \n09:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0do not like the idea much, at least for now, since there are still awkward issue  \n09:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for example, group are not merged properly  \n09:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, but we need to distinguish between merge/conflicts that shouldn't happen (we need to improve the merge), and the use case when the conflict is expected and there are many such expected conflicts and you want to apply the same action to all/part of them  \n09:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you said \"it is really boring to always change from new to current\" --> so you want to apply \"current\" too all, or at least it should be remembered and selected for the next conflict  \n09:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0well, this would be true when we answer the same many times, for now I do not really  \n09:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0even between wikis, the results differ  \n09:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but remembering the last answer should fix the problem of selecting \"current\" again right?  \n09:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0my only issue with buttons is that the button label is limited and you need to think of a good label, and I'm not sure where to display the explanation text (tooltip? not that visible)  \n09:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0maybe, yes, but it may be no seen, not an easy deal  \n09:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the question is \"Which version do you want to use ?\" Current, Merged, New  \n09:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0there may be some explanation in the tips above, to increase the understanding  \n09:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, but I don't it's clear for all users what current/merged/new means  \n09:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the diff provide the real answer IMO  \n09:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0plus the warning that new may overwrite changes, while current may not work with new version  \n09:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0anyway, a good tips will do, in the same form than \"The document http://cartopass.xwiki4.softec.lu/site/XWiki/XWikiPreferences has changes that could be overwritten during the upgrade.\"  \n09:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0rhoo, the expension of the link in my back :(  \n09:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0by the way, I do have cases where neither of these version are good for me  \n09:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0?  \n09:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and selecting class changes, rights changes, contents changes, and object changes individually would be a must !  \n09:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, ofc, it's in the plan, the idea is to be able to create a \"custom\" version by editing the changes inline  \n09:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0for example, a change in XWikiPreferences, on the class, also bring a change of rights that I want to skip  \n09:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, sure, it's in the plan  \n09:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0that would be great of course  \n09:27\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I also got an issue where there is no changes displayed !  \n09:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the next step is to simply exclude some of the changes from the diff, and then to be able to edit the diff  \n09:27\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and 3 versions proposed  \n09:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0maybe there was no diff between the selected versions  \n09:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0merged and new both says no changes  \n09:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(e.g. current and merged, but there were diff between current and new)  \n09:28\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0no diff at all  \n09:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but I suspect there were some hidden change  \n09:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0not noticed by the diff engine  \n09:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0looks like a bug  \n09:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this is not the first time I see it  \n09:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0but never had enough time to found what is change  \n09:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: would be also great to find a way to avoid all the scrolling, keeping the interface more stable  \n09:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0which scrolling?  \n09:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for merge conflict?  \n09:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I need to scroll to see changes, than it scroll back up when I confirm until the next conflict where I need to scroll down again  \n09:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0keeping the conflict choice stable, and the diff scrolling apart would help a lot  \n09:35\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0not sure, I to do this precisely, but it is definitely moving too much now  \n09:36\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0while importing, the whole page stay in a single window up to now, but once the conflict interface is added I need to scroll to read it  \n09:37\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0so, having the conflict interface in a ligthbox would probably help  \n09:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, I don't like having too many scroll bars, and I prefer the natural flow of text on the web, but I understand your point (you're not the first one to complain about this)  \n09:38\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am not a fan of lightbox, why not a tabbed interface ?  \n09:38\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0on tab for the may process, and one for the conflict  \n09:39\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0to avoid the scrolling up/down, you need to split these too in one way or another  \n09:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not sure about the conflict tab  \n09:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0what about auto-scrolling to the conflict?  \n09:40\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the problem would be that the size of the conflict will change your ability to scroll  \n09:41\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0what is really needed is also to have the listbox (or the buttons ;)) at the same places  \n09:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n09:41\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's something Caty complained about  \n09:41\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I would like to reduce my mouse mouvement as much as possible  \n09:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep, that's how Caty put it :)  \n09:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: during the conflict resolution, is there a way I can check both document to understand the diffing issue ?  \n09:44\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0(just got another \"No changes\" with no merge but a new)  \n09:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no, I think you have a link to the current doc, but you don't have access to the new/merged  \n09:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(I have access in the code, because I create the diff between the versions, but the versions are not accessible right now)  \n09:46\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0ok  \n09:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you should write a mail with all these complains/suggestions and we'll discuss it on devs mailing list. What you see if the first version, so there is room for improvements.  \n09:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: sure, I would like to talk with you since I was not aware of the history and no real time search about the plan, I hope you find my reaction useful, I will surely conclude by a mail  \n09:49\u00a0<tdelafosse>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Denis: your feedback is definitely useful! and it matches in some aspects the feedback I got from Caty and others  \n09:55\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: the do the same action for the rest of the changes, would it be limited to a package ? a wiki ? both ? is the plan detailed about that ?  \n10:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Denis: there is not detailed plan, just an idea  \n10:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0re \"apply the same action\"  \n10:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0ok, so to feed your idea, I need to skip any change in the Blog application of some wiki, not all  \n10:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0currently, this is really tedious  \n10:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0of course, keeping my last choice would help in that case  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0hmm, but DW is working only for the main wiki currently (the second stem, main ui)  \n10:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0how do you upgrade the blog in subwikis?  \n10:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0s/stem/step  \n10:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0oh  \n10:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I simply install the distribution on the farm, and it seems to upgrade farm one wiki after the other  \n10:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ah, you used Install on farm  \n10:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0right  \n10:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0is it prohibited ?  \n10:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, normally the main UI is for the main wiki only, and I was supposed to hide the Install on farm button  \n10:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0for the DW  \n10:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the subwikis don't have a \"main\" ui configured  \n10:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the main UI is currently configured for the war  \n10:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0afaik subwikis should be upgraded, at least for now (I haven't tested much on multiwiki environment), from the last step (Extensions)  \n10:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in the last step you should see extensions that were installed on subwikis and that have upgrades available  \n10:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(at least this was the intention)  \n10:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but anyway, you idea makes sense: be able to apply the same action on all conflicts from a space (which usually means an app) and a wiki (or workspace)  \n10:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0actually \"apply this action for the entire extension\" makes more sens (where the extension is xwiki-platform-blog-ui for instance)  \n10:12\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(i.e. for all the conflicts of page from the app xar)  \n10:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: je suis pas encore arriv\u00e9 au step suivant, beaucoup de conflict...  \n10:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok :)  \n10:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: sorry, not yet at the next step  \n10:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0not easy to switch language between chats :)  \n10:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a good exercise ;)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note: I'm currently triggering manually the functional tests for 4.4M1 (since they need to be triggerd the first time)  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I'm not triggering them in the right order there will be false positives  \n10:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: I may have found an weird issue, I am importing a document with the DW that says language[] and gets a diff with a document I only get with language=en, this is in a subwiki which default to fr, and the main wiki default to en\u2026  \n10:32\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0probably due to the fact I import from the main wiki for subwikis  \n10:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:47\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I think \"language []\" means the doc doesn't have the language set, which usually means it has the default language. We need to fix the \"language []\" display, either don't display the language or say \"default language\".  \n10:47\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0sure, but it doesn't get the right one this time  \n10:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and there is probably other weird issue when the wiki is old  \n10:49\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0by the way [] does not really means default, in fact it means no language  \n10:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, for this I need to implement http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8252  \n10:50\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0which is not exactly the same  \n10:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: which mean it's the default language version of the document generally  \n10:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, which happen in no multilingual environment  \n10:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I do not really experience this issue, I have a lot of conflict, but nothing abnormal for the changes I currently apply  \n10:51\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: no, it don't  \n10:52\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: you may have a no language version, and a localisased version of the same document  \n10:53\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: the no language version is not the same as the having a document in the default xwiki language  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: the fact that you can create inconsistency in the DB does not make them normal  \n10:53\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: the no language version has a lot of meaning, the default language can be changed at anytime  \n10:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you as a document without indicating the document you get the document without no language set, so the default one, the one on which objects are associated etc  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: I know the default language can be changed and it's going to create a mess  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/without indicating the document/without indicating the language/  \n10:55\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: do not mix to different things, the implementation and the fact that a document has no language is unrelated  \n10:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the document without language is supposed to be the default document, the root one from which you get the translations. It's not just implementation, that's what you get in the API too.  \n10:56\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: a document that use the localization modules, is not in a specific language, it is all at ones, and these document shoud not have a language associated to them, else it will be missleading  \n10:56\u00a0<sdumitriu2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0so we need such document, since most of the document we provide are of that kind. The question is, how to we upgrade them on a multi-lingual where the main document has a language, and on a mono-lingual wiki where it may exists with a language, and a translation (abnormal, but exists)  \n11:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0EM does not care about mono/multi lingual, a unique document is a reference and a language, what you need to find it in the DB and it will upgrade what matches that  \n11:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0ok, it doesn't  \n11:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and this will not work properly on old wiki where some of our no language document get qualified en  \n11:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i don't understand what you mean either it has a language or it does not  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:02\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you have document with language=\"\" and document with language=\"en\"  \n11:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0different documents then  \n11:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0most of the technical, automatically translated, document we produce should be language=\"\"  \n11:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0now, I only speak about the default mail document, not about any translations  \n11:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0s/mail/main  \n11:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you may have a main document with language=\"en\", and an upgrade containing a main document with language=\"\"  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it's two different documents  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you could also change it's name  \n11:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0it is the main document, not the translation, and therefore the same, and we currently remove the \"en\"  \n11:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and it could happen on a wiki with a default language = \"fr\"  \n11:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0a wiki which will return the \"fr\" document for &language=  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0how can getDocument find a document which doe snot have empty language ?  \n11:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this is weird  \n11:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the main document have a language field, this is the original language  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I know it has a language field  \n11:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0other language are translations  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you don't know this language  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you justr call getDocument without indicating it  \n11:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0you get the one it has  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0whcih is why it's supposed to be empty  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you generate an id to get the document  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't ask for the first one it find  \n11:11\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: http://troll.ws/image/26c47c6d  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's the default language  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not the language  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in your screenshot  \n11:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0that nothing meaningfull  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I tough you were saying it was a different language  \n11:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then we should not display it in the diff UI that's all  \n11:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I said that the default language of the wiki is unrelated to that field  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure but it does not change the fact that a document has a field called default language  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's an information  \n11:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0that field is the original language, not the default one  \n11:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no EM bug here  \n11:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0as I said EM has a bug, I am talking about DW  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: this screenshot iss EM  \n11:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DW just call EM to install a XAR  \n11:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0no, the ui display original document, and translated document  \n11:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: sure, but the goal of DW is the one of EM, or have I missed the goal ?  \n11:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0where do you see the original language ?  \n11:15\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0in the editor ui  \n11:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0on a multilingual wiki of course  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(11:14:44 AM) Denis: no, the ui display original document, and translated document  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what UI are you talking about  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0please don't mix everything  \n11:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what exactly is wrong here ?  \n11:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0as a developer, I fully get the problem, as a user it is a complete mess  \n11:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am on a french wiki (not multi-lingual), I run the DW, it show a diff about an default language=en document, that it want to update, a document I could only see if I use &language=en, a document it want to update to language[]  \n11:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0do you see the mess for the end-user ?  \n11:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: you want EM to skip conflict resolution for a document you can't see in the UI when in mono-lingual mode ?  \n11:21\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: I do not want anything, I am just exposing the situation, I have not yet a clear idea on how to solve that mess we have created over time  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue here is that we have a conflict and it has to be fixed, I understand that you don't want to see a document you don't care because you are never going to use it but it's not some quick bugfix...  \n11:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this was simply not the document I expected to be diffed  \n11:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you see the conflict mostly because of hidden field here  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not really related to translations  \n11:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this is not this document in particular tmortagne  \n11:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this one was the one I was on at the time we talk  \n11:23\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the document I had the issue with was Main.WebHome  \n11:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: if there was no change on the hidden field you would not have seen this conflict  \n11:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0and it was diffed against it english version, while the one used is the french version  \n11:24\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I was even not aware of any english version of that document, but I would probably be interested in upgrading the french one  \n11:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's two different documents, you probably got the french one before or will later  \n11:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0there is no french, the current is no language !  \n11:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0we are upgrading the english to no language  \n11:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the french translation no more exists or have never existed  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course not we are upgrade the no language to no language, the en you see is what was in the \"default language\" field, I don't know why the default language field does not have anything anymore but it's completely different  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looking at XAppResource page in the XAR  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand what the default language has been removed  \n11:28\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: my screenshot seems to be another story !  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n11:29\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n11:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: ok I get that you are talking like a user but keep repeating this instead of trying to understand why it's happening is not going to fix it...  \n11:32\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: http://troll.ws/image/11055072 is worse !  \n11:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so not the user is not supposed to get this all the time  \n11:32\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: that was not my initial point  \n11:32\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0hah nice  \n11:33\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: we used to have at a time \"en\" where \"\" was appropriate, we created translations in mono-lingual wiki at another time, and now we have a mess  \n11:33\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0maybe it's coming from java6 (which we require anyway)  \n11:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: but this has nothing to do with the screenshot you are sending  \n11:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Rhino is in java 6  \n11:34\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0heh so we are guaranteed to have it  \n11:34\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: sorry, my screenshot was misleading with my initial point  \n11:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: jvelo reported an issue about that  \n11:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, I eval'd \u00a0\u00a0print('hello world') \u00a0and it came out in the server log  \n11:38\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:38\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0cjd: but for the moment we cannot batch \"loadDocument\" can we ?  \n11:38\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: btw, I still have to investigate since I got empty diff as well  \n11:38\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0so you'd still load all documents individually  \n11:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0not with the current technology, we'd have to do some hacking in XHS (or rewrite it)  \n11:39\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: empty diff also happen in the normal ui  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: would be nice to report empty diff but it's possible the standard diff UI does not show something that was checked by EM  \n11:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but the back end is not the problem IMO, at the back end, being fast is just a matter of sitting down and writing the code, the problem is bad API  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: you mean in history view ?  \n11:39\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0one good thing with javascript IMO is sharing templates on the backend and on the frontend  \n11:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0indeed  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you say \"normal UI\"  \n11:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0we could actually have a single unified API which is accessable to the back end and the front end  \n11:40\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, I also got that before there, I though it was simply true, but I doubt now  \n11:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that would be pretty cool  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: if it was in older version it's possible it was because of hidden field  \n11:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I added it recently to standard diff UI  \n11:41\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and it would prevent any bad synchronous api from growing because it would be miserably slow if it was XMLHttpRequest backed.  \n11:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it was forgotten when hidden field was introduced  \n11:41\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: let me some time, I have some samples I need to compare  \n11:41\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: but I should get rid of all that conflict before :)  \n11:42\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:42\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Oh the other exciting thing is that unlike Velocity, Rhino generates bytecode so we can trick the jvm into caching native code for our hot pages.  \n12:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: is there a way to access non-public Maven with EM ?  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: yep, you have an auth example in last xwiki.properties  \n12:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0oh, should be new, I never seen it, but I do not merge properly  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep it's new  \n12:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-tools/xwiki-platform-tool-configuration-resources/src/main/resources/xwiki.properties.vm#L441  \n12:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: great !  \n12:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it passes it to httpclient, I think it supports only BASIC right now  \n12:05\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: should work with nexus no ?  \n12:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: not tested much but I guess yes  \n12:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I just did a quick test with an apache  \n12:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: brrr, git an issue while resolving some very last conflicts :(  \n12:08\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Failed to retrieve extension data.Server not responding  \n12:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0during the import ?  \n12:09\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yes, I was asking for keeping current  \n12:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't understand how that's possible since you already downloaded the XAR, you are importing it  \n12:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0could you passe the log around it  \n12:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0the only logs, are about lucene having an issue with an attachement, nothing else :(  \n12:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I mean what do you have before \"Failed to retrieve extension data.Server not responding\", nothing ?  \n12:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0even the info log  \n12:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0want to see what it was doing  \n12:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I think you were talking about a server side error in the extension log  \n12:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0?  \n12:12\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0http://troll.ws/image/91579e8b  \n12:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0nothing on the server side  \n12:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0is it ok when you refresh the page ?  \n12:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the message suggests that XWiki was not responding  \n12:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you should try to reload the page  \n12:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0seems it have broken the XWikiServerPage  \n12:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am screwed  \n12:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha right could be because of that  \n12:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you applied the new version indtead of keeping the one with your own domain ?  \n12:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0I am not sure, I may have  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are not that screwed, can you access XWiki with ip, or a domain starting with \"xwiki\" or \"www\" ?  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that should get you to the main wiki to fix the wiki descriptor  \n12:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or you can access a subwiki and fix the page with a script  \n12:18\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0no luck for ip or www, get the same issue  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Denis: you can't access the wiki ?  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0with IP I can't see how it's possible  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's possible you get the same issue in the DW if you don't fix the page first  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess it's generating an absolute URL or something  \n12:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: it cannot get me to the main wiki, it simply says wiki does not exists  \n12:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0with IP ?  \n12:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0yes  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you disable the fallback on main wiki in xwiki.cfg ?  \n12:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0disabled  \n12:22\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0xwiki.virtual.autowww=0 :(  \n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so indeed it's a bit more complex  \n12:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you can write a script in a subwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0to set the right value in the field \"server\" of \"XWiki.XWikiServerClass\" object in page \"XWiki.XWikiserverXwiki\" page  \n12:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:35\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0tmortagne: great idea the script, I am back on track !  \n13:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: I am not sure we need to provide the diff immediately, this could speedup thinks, no ?  \n13:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Denis: wdym by \"not immediately\"?  \n13:02\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0mflorea: not before the user ask for it  \n13:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't think computing the diff takes very long  \n13:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep I really doubt the diff takes any time  \n13:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0what takes so long when a conflict arise then ?  \n13:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not supposed to take long  \n13:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't have conflict on all the pages  \n13:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0loading the pages without any conflict takes some time I guess  \n13:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has someone committed something in commons?

 \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because we don't have any selenium dep on commons  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAIK  \n13:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we don't, it's just in dep management  \n13:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me try locally  \n13:18\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0builds fine here, hmmm  \n13:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0is it ok to forward infra mail to devs?

I don't think it's a flicker. I reverted the selenium upgrade locally and the test still fails in the console so it must be caused by a previous change.

SO they are not available for snapshots ?  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can reproduce all the time on the agent6  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which I've taken offline)  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0passes locally with maven  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I'll continue investigating on agent6  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but would be easier locally  \n15:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0hmm, strange, maven 3.0.4?  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you rerproduce all the time locally marius?  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0testing with maven  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if so it might be easier for you to attach to the test and dbeug  \n15:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, it fails all the time locally  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mvn -Dmaven.surefire.debug=\"-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt\\_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE\" test  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then attach in your IDE  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same for me, fail with maven  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looking at it  \n15:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I tried to debug but I'm not that familiar with the logging code, I'm not sure where is the code that filters messages based on level.  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll let thomas look at it then  \n15:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since he's the most familiar  \n15:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0thanks  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0putting back agent6 online  \n15:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: yes, seems to work, but I got this in the UI \"Vous avez oubli\u00e9 votre nom dutilisateur{1} ou votre {2}mot de passe{3} ?\" instead of the correct message.

This is more of a hint of how to do it. Normally, the user should use advanced search and install Workspace API on the entire farm, because the 'Workspace Component' extension page is not augmented with extension information and thus it is not displayed on EM  \n16:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I thought it was simpler for a user to do it this way for now  \n16:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: you could either make Workspace Component installable or add a page for Worskspaces - API, would be simpler for users  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: you can now edit your references at http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/References/WebHome and fill the Developed by field :)  \n16:49\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: will have a look of how that works when I get some time  \n16:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8328 :(  \n16:57\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:13\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: I will update right now, just noticed the display is not correct when no value are set in the General Information \u00a0box.  \n17:23\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelo: is there an easy way to render a field containing wiki syntax in the livetable?

 \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess we could have 2 fields but it's a bit cumbersome  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one field for the label and one field for the url  \n17:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0developedByName, developedByURL  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sheet: [[developedByName>>developedByURL]]  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in the LT just use developedByName  \n17:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we can't force using a wiki user ?  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0an org is not really a user  \n17:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it also makes it hard to create new ref for users  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we have a XWiki Dev Team user for extensions.xwiki.org for example  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it could also be a developer name and URL separated  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a more complex one would be to let user put syntax but it means discarding PR like we do with comments and use the rendering script service to parse and rendering the field content  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a bit of a pain in Velocity  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sorry I have to go  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:34\u00a0<sdumitriu2>\u00a0is now known as <sdumitriu1>  \n19:11\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<tdedelafosse>\u00a0has quit  \n19:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:12\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:28\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:34\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:53\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:08\u00a0<mrvanes>\u00a0has quit  \n21:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:29\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n22:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:29\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0sburjan`: is the DW has been tested on migrations ?
