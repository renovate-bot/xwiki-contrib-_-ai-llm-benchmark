Only one issue closed. I'm currently working on integrating the tree in the wysiwyg editor  \n09:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0XWIKI-5484 and XWIKI-3796 in the roadmap list  \n09:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0then the plan is to use the new tree for the DBTreeList properties, but for 6.4.1 most probably  \n09:40\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that is XWIKI-8760, XWIKI-11398 and XWIKI-5852  \n09:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0integrating the tree in the DW (report step can be done as part of the DW work planned for 7.0)  \n09:42\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that is XWIKI-10204  \n09:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the remaining 2, XWIKI-11046 and XWIKI-11550, are for 6.4.1  \n09:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: 6.4 final is Monday  \n09:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I know  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what do you want to do for 6.4 final?  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe all should go in 6.4.1?  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm also worried about that delay this will globally generate for your work on the 7.0 roadmap  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do we need to delay 6.4 final and introduce a 6.4RC2?  \n09:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0as I said, I'm currently work on integrating the tree in the wysiwyg editor, this can get into 6.4 final. the rest in 6.4.1  \n09:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no, I think we should stick with 6.4 final and then 6.4.1  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but 6.4 should not have any changes normally since RC1 is already released...  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0will you be ready for Monday?  \n09:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I know the rule, but when did we ever do this?...  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we did a lot in the past  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we very rarely committed stuff after RC in the past  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then at some point we started accepting it a bit more  \n09:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's not what I recall  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case it's not something to do at all  \n09:53\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has quit  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and introducing a new RC is usually preferable unless the stuff committed is really limited and safe  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the real question is whether you'll be ready for Monday  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since we can have a 6.4.1 realtively quickly after we could accept the risk)  \n09:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I might be ready with the wysiwyg integration, but the rest will be left for 6.4.1  \n10:00\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just checked, we've never had any final release without any issue, we've had 2 final with only 1 issue though\u2026 but indeed majority varies between 10-40  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a lot for 6.x, less for 5.x, 4.x, 3.x, quite a lot for 2.x  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n10:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has quit  \n10:37\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:43\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:43\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n10:43\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:45\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n10:50\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has quit  \n10:52\u00a0<Bugendolf>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:53\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n11:54\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:57\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n12:22\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:23\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n12:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:37\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:44\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:10\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:29\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n13:30\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:36\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n13:46\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:43\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:21\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:23\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:32\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n16:34\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:44\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:57\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:58\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:00\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:20\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:35\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:55\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:55\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<Zephyr1139>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:18\u00a0<Zephyr1139>\u00a0!help  \n20:40\u00a0<Zephyr1139>\u00a0Is it possible to deny access to specific redmine pages?
