In any case, we shouldn't use XML validator with JSON  \n10:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we need a JSON \"validator\"  \n10:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it seems getusersandgroups.vm is generating JSON from the start (13 Feb 2008) so I don't understand how we ended up using the XML validator  \n10:37\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, I think the fix for XWIKI-13284 could be simplified a little, thus meeting the quality standards, but I am afraid to touch the code as I cannot reproduce the issue locally. I guess I will only decrease the expected coverage, as it already happened on the master  \n10:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm looking at the escaping tests  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"how we ended up using the XML validator\" we use validator on all vm automatically except those that are explicitly excluded, I guess we just did not noticed before that the validation was failing and forgot to exclude it  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just need to add it in XE test pom  \n10:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we already have stuff in there excluded because \"generates JSON\"  \n10:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0-2% ClemensR, starting to be a lot ;) lol  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(from 80% to 78%)  \n10:50\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0Hi devs, I just replied on the dev ML, where a user was confused by the \"Adminitrater Parent\" option on a terminal page, and wants to manage right on the page. Obviously, this is counter intuitive to have to find the edit Rights option, and also this not an option you get as a simple user. Is there any plan on evolving that soon ?  \n10:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0actually the code looks redundant and looks like it could be fixed easily back in the 80% regime, but as I cannot reproduce the original issue ... :-/  \n10:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:58\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0this edit right being accessible to advanced user only looks even inconsistent with the page administration, which allow editing right of the page, even for simple user  \n11:00\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0another, quite confusing situation is the administer parent option, since it provide page right edition on the WebPreference page, if I get it well  \n11:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: no, this is different, it's about explicit tests  \n11:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-enterprise/blob/master/xwiki-enterprise-test/xwiki-enterprise-test-escaping/src/test/it/org/xwiki/test/escaping/UsersAndGroupsTest.java  \n11:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0e.g. testGetUsersAndGroups  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it indeed does not make any sense if that document template always been JSON  \n11:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n11:06\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0oh, no it is on the webhome parent, but it is not obvious, but more consistent indeed, curious to check if no webhome exists  \n11:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm going to replace the XML validator with a JSON parser just to verify that the JSON is valid  \n11:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0only for these tests ofc  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0look like the goal was not really to validate XML on it, XML validation is just a bonus you get in those tests...  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ideally we should skip validation based on the mime type of the response (and later add support for JSON validation)  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that way we would not have to explicitely excelude stuff like we do  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0as a bonus it also check that we put the right content type in the response  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: \"Is there any plan on evolving that soon ?\". short answer: no  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no = I don't know anyone working on that  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if a proposal and PR materializes though then it could happen I guess  \n11:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now the workaround is to read the doc  \n11:13\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0well, ok, but this is definitely a mess, not understandable from a user POV, I just checked the last case, setting right on administer parent could even create that parent !  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n11:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not like it's not known  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now it's even more important to fix the fully broken stuff re NS  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0FTR I've made a roadmap proposal on the list this morning  \n11:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you're interested to participate to something for XWiki 8.2 please reply to it with what you could work on Denis!  \n11:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"fix the fully broken stuff re NS\" and even for that, there's nobody assigned  \n11:17\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0there is no mention in your mail, isn't it ?  \n11:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of what?  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the mail only talks about stuff agreed with xwiki sas devs  \n11:19\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0polishing/fixing NS issues  \n11:20\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0sorry, I though it was part of the roadmap discussed, and a priority, but that we were lacking jira issues  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh no we have plenty of jira issues ;)  \n11:25\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0so it just means that we have no plan to work on this during 8.2 ?  \n11:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0tmortagne: about MOCCACAL-102 I guess will release the workaround, maybe even today, or did you get any feedback so far?  \n11:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ClemensR: sorry, did not had the time to test but from what I understood it's look better, lets say I trust you :)  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0important things is not less forget the all day thing  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: it means there's nobody from the xwiki sas devs assigned to work on NS stuff indeed. Except for BFD ofc  \n11:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, I do not really trust me on this, but I guess it is worth a try anyway ;)  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n11:29\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0vmassol: BFD are for low hanging fruit, so not really adapted  \n12:35\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n12:49\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea, ClemensR: escape test on unsupported content type (anything but XML right now) don't fail anymore (but log a warning)  \n13:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0cool  \n13:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like we have 5 test in this case  \n13:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0need to do the same kind of thing for xwiki-enterprise-test-webstandards probably  \n13:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(ideally refactor all this mess to have a common framework for those two)  \n13:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I was working on the same thing.. :(  \n13:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: you talked about supported JSON  \n13:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can still add your JSON related work in the if I added  \n13:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I just skip anything that was not XML  \n13:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in AbstractEscapingTest#getUnderEscapingErrors  \n13:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:24\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:25\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n15:26\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: done, renamed \"Rendering\" into \"Syntaxes\"  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Denis: now we have till the end of 8.2 to find a way to display active syntaxes instead of disabled ones...  \n16:07\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0Hi everyone, Please help me! :)  \n16:07\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0I have tried to build the android-authenticator app in the jenkins ci.  \n16:07\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0But there are some errors in the build process.

And the sdk tools, like adb and fastboot, are also compiled for 32bit system.  \n17:01\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0Installing ia32-libs should be the most direct and common way to develop and build android apps.  \n17:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0fitz: I googled too (a bit) and came to the same conclusion  \n17:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0but the stackoverflow link you gave was suggesting that the ia32-libs solution is not working anymore and that the lib32z1 and libstdc++6:i386 packages should be installed instead  \n17:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0anyway, I`ve relayed the request and all 3 packages are now installed on the 1-1 agent  \n17:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0let`s try to trigger a build on that agent to see if it works now  \n17:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I`ll do it  \n17:03\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0:) thanks a lot.  \n17:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0back, thanks Enygma`for taking care of it  \n17:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0fitz: unfortunately the build agents are very busy right now and it could take a while for the #6 build of the authenticator job to get scheduled and run  \n17:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0fitz: so apparently we have installed just lib32z1 for now on the 1-1 agent. If that does not fix it, we can try the others, but one at a time to avoid installing unneded things  \n17:13\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0Ok, many thanks for helping me, Enygma` ! \u00a0I'll look at the #6 build later. Thank you very much. :)  \n17:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n17:14\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:15\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:22\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0Well, I have another problem. It's my first time to use JIRA. I don't know how to close my issue?  \n17:27\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/ANDAUTH-1  \n17:27\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0it seems that I do not have this permission. But I should be able to mark the issue resolved.  \n17:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fitz: you probably don't have the right to close the issue, let me check  \n17:27\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0yes there is no such resolved option to select?  \n17:28\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0I just can change the status to In Progress, and I have tried JIRA smart commit but it didn't work.  \n17:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0should be ok  \n17:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you are now the leader of the project  \n17:30\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0that's ok! thank you so much, my mentor! :)  \n17:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I get something weird with 7.4 as parent pom in an extension, my groupid is \"org.xwiki.contrib.oidc\" and I end up with \"You cannot use a group id starting with [org.xwiki] since that's reserved for the XWiki Core Committers\"  \n17:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I hope we don't really just check if the groupid starts with \"org.xwiki\"...  \n17:43\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep that's it, the group id can only be exactly \"org.xwiki.contrib\" or not start with \"org.xwiki\" at all, not very nice  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: looks like a bug  \n17:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0created XCOMMONS-979  \n17:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm not really sure this test is really that useful  \n18:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0basically it's just about preventing project that have xwiki-commons as parent to use something like \"org.xwiki.<unknownmodule>\", I don't think it really worth the trouble  \n18:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol ?  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would probably to just get rid of it  \n18:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/probably/propose/  \n18:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: WDYT ?  \n18:09\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or then we modify checkNonCoreArtifactId() to check that the groupid starts with \"org.xwiki.contrib\" which will get the same result than what was intended  \n18:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no not exactly since this one is about artifact id but add the method just near this one that check for \"org.xwiki.contrib\"  \n18:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0removing the check for now since it's doing more harm than good, we can always introduce a new one later  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back, reading  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"I would probably to just get rid of it\" I don't understand why. We don't want contrib projects to use that  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a reserved namespace  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's very importnat for me  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i'm -1 to remove the check tmortagne  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically the check's intent is:  \n18:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- allow org.xwiki.contrib.\\*  \n18:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then as I said it's really not the right way to check than, just need to check if the groupid start with \"org.xwiki.contrib\" inside isXWikiCoreCommitterExtension else  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- as an exception, allow some modules that were moved from commons/rendering/platform/enterprise as an interim solution  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm just commenting on \"removing the check for now\"  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that one would be a real regression ;)  \n18:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0less than the current situation  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the current situation is not a regression  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since there was no check before  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes it's not good  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0of course it is because it's impossible to upgrade de depending of existing extensions  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the right solution is to to allow org.xwiki.contrib.\\*  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/depending/dependency/  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can skip the check if need be so it's impossible  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*not  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but again the solution is not to remove the check  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's to fix the bug  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can do it if you don't want to do it, but not now  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the meantime you can skip the check in your pom as a workaround  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw we might want to introduce a way to make it easy to skip just this check  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and not all enforcer checks)  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm this might already be possible with the enforcer acutally  \n18:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0using the proper maven execution id combined with a skip config  \n18:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: looks like there is a bug in org.xwiki.tool.enforcer.ValidateDependencyVersion too, it's complaining that I don't use ${project.version} for xwiki-platform-oldcore  \n18:55\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:( I really need to add unit tests. I did this in a hurry\u2026.  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no you're talking about an old stuff here  \n18:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nop  \n18:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a07.4  \n18:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless it's different in more recent versions of 7.4.x  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ValidateDependencyVersion dates back to 4.5  \n18:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0introduced in ValidateDependencyVersion yes  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean I introuced a regression when I refactored it?  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when I refactored for \"Add POM validation rules\")  \n18:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no in that case I think it's something else  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:59\u00a0<Aranjedeath>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like this check does not look at current groupid and is fully based on stuff configured in the pom and in this specific case I used platform as parent for this extension  \n19:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it should probably check if current groupid is the same than dependency groupid  \n19:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway it's easy to fix on my side  \n19:02\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n19:13\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n19:37\u00a0<moep>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:44\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0has quit  \n19:46\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:00\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:13\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:22\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:56\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:22\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:33\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n22:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:59\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
