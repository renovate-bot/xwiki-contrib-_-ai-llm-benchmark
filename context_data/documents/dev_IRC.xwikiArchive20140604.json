 \n17:04\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0ok nervermind, I found it  \n17:10\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I'm probably going to make the ldap sync module, but what to do if new configurable things will have to be added?

 \n18:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0not stupid ... there are a lot of options where preformance can go  \n18:30\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0I know that if I have a lot of changes on pages the activity stream takes a while  \n18:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0first step is to replace \"/view/\" by \"/get/\" and see if the problem remains  \n18:31\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Where should I place that and what does it indicate  \n18:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0then you see if it is the content on the page or some panels etc ...  \n18:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, in the URL  \n18:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the /xwiki/bin/view/... \u00a0-> /xwiki/bin/get/...  \n18:32\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0ahh ok  \n18:34\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0and if the perfomance is different I know that to draw a panel etc. is the problem?  \n18:35\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0if the speed is the same I can check somehow the MySQL Database?  \n18:45\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, if speed is the same, is is the actual content in the page, and not some decoration .... but it could be that either the mySQL DB is slow or XWiki does something complicated server side  \n18:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0but anyway, from there you can edit the page and remove elements to see what part makes the page slow \u00a0... and from what I have heard the activity stream is a good guess to start with  \n18:47\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:48\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0ok, I will play around  \n18:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes activity stream is pretty slow  \n18:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(it can end up doing tons of database request when there is lots of changes)  \n18:53\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0so the only way is to limit the activity stream or make the database fast?  \n18:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really sure how to make the activity stream fact actually  \n18:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/fact/fast/  \n18:55\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0yes - fast  \n18:55\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0I think is now time for me to go home and don't wast your time :)  \n18:58\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0have a good evening  \n18:58\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0bye  \n18:58\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:14\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:14\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:30\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n20:30\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:20\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Is it possible to completely replace user management in xwiki? I wanted to make xwiki to ldap sync, but there may always be situation where xwiki is out of sync.  \n21:22\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Like xwiki may immediately change a ldap directory when user changes. But it cannot detect ldap changes and use them to change users in xwiki unless the user logs in.  \n21:23\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0No problem except syncing groups. If I would like to be able to sync membership of groups to ldap it is okay, but if this is changed ldap side...  \n21:25\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I believe the task is complicated to get it right, at least in the case of distributing it as an extension.  \n21:28\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0For example: syncing group members may or may not work. What if someone would like to use xwiki to manage groups like create and delete them? doable but incompatible with ldap authentication that is given group to ldap map, unless tou would always need to update the map.  \n21:28\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Actually group names don't map directly to ldap logically.  \n21:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n22:00\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:09\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n22:16\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Why, when I log out of xwiki, I get a page looking as I was still logged in?  \n22:20\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:26\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n22:26\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:33\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0?  \n22:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:12\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n23:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n23:30\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:34\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n23:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:42\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:42\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n23:43\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
