That's not how CSS works  \nsdumitriu - (09:40): If you want to target one table, use a specific selector  \nsdumitriu - (09:40): Add an ID to the table  \nStulle - (09:40): well, that's what mflorea suggested yesterday  \nStulle - (09:40): and it's actually documented in the syntax guide  \nStulle - (09:40): see XWIKI-5618  \nStulle - (09:41): last example in mflorea's first comment  \nsdumitriu - (09:41): evalica: Should we add the silk companion icons to XWiki?  \nmflorea - (09:42): Stulle: you can use (% id=\"special\" %) and then use #special in you skin extension.

If you want to target just a single table then you can use (% id=\"someUniqueId\" %) instead of (% class=\"alignBottom\" %) and then in your skin extension you write something like #someUniqueId td {vertical-align:bottom} . Of course, this will affect all the cells in the table. If you want to target only one cell, then you have too see what's different between the example from the issue description (which works  \nStulle - (09:50): okay, i get what he meant now but how can this relate to your comment yesterday? does it mean there are two ways, the one you suggested and the one from sdumitriu or is you one not capable of achieving the aim under certain circumstances or what?  \nmflorea - (09:52): me and sdumitriu suggested the same thing: to use a skin extension. Whether you use a class name, i.e. (% class=\"someClassName\" %) or an identifier, i.e. (% id=\"someUniqueIdentifier\" %) it's just a small detail.  \nStulle - (09:53): ah, okay, that clears it up for me  \nmflorea - (09:53): the only difference is that the class name can be used on multiple tables, while the id is just for one table  \nmflorea - (09:53): but the effect is the same  \nStulle - (09:53): i see  \nStulle - (09:54): will try if the id way works for me when the class= way does not  \nmflorea - (09:55): I doubt it, since it doesn't really matter in your case if you use id or class name  \nStulle - (09:55): okay, i'll trust you there, then ;)  \nkwoot joined #xwiki at 09:55  \nkwoot - (09:55): Hello, just want to say congrats on the gartner report.

 \nsdumitriu - (22:19): Checking  \nsdumitriu - (22:25): The cssparser bug seems to be solved: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1931613&group\\_id=82996&atid=567969  \nvmassol - (22:26): sdumitriu: ok so we need to wait for a release and then remove the hack?  \nsdumitriu - (22:27): It's not a hack, it's an improvement with the current code  \nsdumitriu - (22:27): Since we're specifying CSS21 where the default was CSS20  \nvmassol - (22:29): it looks like a hack because you're exposing something internal  \nvmassol - (22:30): the com.whatever package  \nvmassol - (22:30): (don't recall its name)  \nvmassol - (22:31): maybe it's not internal and meant to be exposed, it just looks less nice than not exposing it  \nvmassol - (22:31): but then I haven't followed the discussion and I have never used css4j  \nvmassol - (22:32): so I'm probably talking rubbish :)  \nsdumitriu - (22:33): Yes, it's true, but the constructor itself was from a custom package  \nsdumitriu - (22:34): Ideally we should use the ParserFactory from org.w3c.css.sac.helpers  \nsdumitriu - (22:34): http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/SAC/doc/org/w3c/css/sac/helpers/ParserFactory.html#makeParser\\_\\_  \nsdumitriu - (22:35): But batik-css doesn't register itself as an implementation (batik bug), and cssparser doesn't accept third party DocumentHandlers (fixed bug in cssparser trunk)  \ncjdelisle - (22:37): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1848154/dependency-injection-by-type-using-generics-how-does-it-work <-- this would look very nice in the ECM.  \nvmassol - (22:45): cjdelisle: looks interesting  \nvmassol - (22:45): reading  \nvmassol - (22:45): I thought it was not possible to do  \nvmassol - (22:47): nice  \nvmassol - (22:47): cjdelisle: if you want to refactor the ECM to support it go ahead  \ncjdelisle - (22:48): i didn't think it was possible either, I am thinking about using a provider for the binary object support and I got to thinking \"how does provider work anyway?\"  \ncjdelisle - (22:49): {{groovy}}println(doc.getClass().getDeclaredField(\"defaultEntityReferenceSerializer\").getGenericType());{{/groovy}}  \ncjdelisle - (22:49): indeed it works.  \nlucaa - (22:52): sdumitriu: when is the AnnotationUpdateEvent fired?  \nlucaa - (22:52): by whom I mean?  \nsdumitriu - (22:53): For the ActivityStream?  \nsdumitriu - (22:53): Inside com.xpn.xwiki.XWiki#onEvent  \nlucaa - (22:53): yes, for what I need to make it not be fired anymore  \nsdumitriu - (22:53): Only in a 2.6 trunk  \nlucaa - (22:53): I need to stop saving objects, I was wondering if I can stop the event from being fired  \nlucaa - (22:54): it would be nicer  \nsdumitriu - (22:54): But there's also the document updated event  \nsdumitriu - (22:54): Which gets triggered in XWiki#saveDocument  \nlucaa - (22:55): ah yes...  \nlucaa - (22:55): that's gonna stay no matter what  \nlucaa - (22:55): the pb is that annotations objects might update, but for the user it doesn't make sense  \nlucaa - (22:55): so it would be nicer if we could not fire the event  \nlucaa - (22:56): the annotation update event  \nsdumitriu - (22:57): Yes, that's not real user activity  \nsdumitriu - (22:57): It's something that the platform does  \nsdumitriu - (22:58): rrodriguez: Ping  \nrrodriguez - (22:59): sdumitriu: Pong!  \nrrodriguez - (22:59): hi!  \nlucaa - (22:59): yes, any idea how to fix that fast sdumitriu?  \nlucaa - (22:59): my quick and dirty is to leave it be triggered and hope for the best  \nsdumitriu - (23:04): Hi rrodriguez  \nrrodriguez - (23:05): Hi sdumitriu, may I help?  \nsdumitriu - (23:05): Do you still have graffle installed?  \nrrodriguez - (23:06): yeap  \nsdumitriu - (23:06): I'd like to update the image from http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration#HCustomizingthePDFexportLook26Feel but I can't edit that file, since Graffle is only for Mac  \nsdumitriu - (23:06): Do you have some time to do it now?  \nsdumitriu - (23:06): lucaa: I really believe that updating annotations on a prenotifier is the way to go  \nrrodriguez - (23:07): It will be nice to update it here. In fact, I'm struggling to understand the current state of the art of the new Rendering architecture  \nrrodriguez - (23:07): I've seen Jira Issue 5509 closed  \nvmassol - (23:07): XWIKI-5509  \nsdumitriu - (23:08): lucaa: Hm, actually no, this still means that if an annotation is updated automatically, it will appear as a user activity  \nrrodriguez - (23:08): I can do it now if you tell me what to do  \nsdumitriu - (23:08): rrodriguez: K, let me see  \nrrodriguez - (23:08): K  \nlucaa - (23:08): sdumitriu:yes, I was just about to ask that  \nlucaa - (23:08): the only advantage is that it will save the document only once  \nlucaa - (23:09): because i can update the annotation objects, and not save the document, leave it for the save I was just prenotified for  \nsdumitriu - (23:09): rrodriguez: The first green box, \"pdf.vm calls ExportAction\" actually it's the other way around: \"ExportAction renders pdf.vm\"  \nlucaa - (23:09): I can do a few extra checks in the annotations maintainer and update annotations only when it's really like really needed  \nlucaa - (23:10): but even those are not all relevant for users  \nrrodriguez - (23:10): give me some minutes to regain access to this chart...  \nsdumitriu - (23:10): rrodriguez: It's attached to the document  \nsdumitriu - (23:10): lucaa: A clear bug is that the annotation date is changed  \nlucaa - (23:10): and they would take time, the extra checks  \nlucaa - (23:11): yes, that's a bug  \nrrodriguez - (23:11): yeap, I do remember to have uploaded it, just trying to remember what does it mean  \nlucaa - (23:11): well, what I will do now, is filter only the annotations that have something changed, and save only those  \nlucaa - (23:11): ftm I am updating and saving all  \nlucaa - (23:11): because thye update is a bit fuzzy  \nlucaa - (23:12): (see the org.xwiki.annotation.maintainer.AbstractAnnotationMaintainer for details about why is it fuzzy)  \nrrodriguez - (23:14): sdumitriu: done  \nsdumitriu - (23:14): K, next, Radeox is no longer relevant  \nsdumitriu - (23:15): So the \"rendered by Radeox\" should just become \"include the rendered content\"  \nsdumitriu - (23:15): If that's too long and breaks the layout, just use \"render the content\"  \nrrodriguez - (23:16): done  \nsdumitriu - (23:16): In the pink boxes, I'd put XWiki.PDFClass#style (# instead of the second .)  \njvelociter - (23:17): scheduler job selenium tests are failing on trunk  \njvelociter - (23:17): looks like a real failure  \njvelociter - (23:17): (does not work on my build either)  \njvelociter - (23:17): http://hudson.xwiki.org/view/Functional%20Tests/job/xwiki-product-enterprise-tests/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-selenium/114/testReport/org.xwiki.test.selenium/SchedulerTest/testJobActions/  \nsdumitriu - (23:18): rrodriguez: I'd move XWiki.PDFClass#xhtmlxsl and XWiki.PDFClass#fopxsl between the packed file and their respective processor (Xalan, FOP)  \nsdumitriu - (23:19): rrodriguez: I'd add a new XHTML node between \"rendered content\" and \"clean with JTidy\"  \nsdumitriu - (23:19): So, the first XHMLT should be called \"Initial XHTML\"  \nsdumitriu - (23:20): The second one, after JTidy, shoul be called \"Cleaded XHTML\"  \nsdumitriu - (23:20): The third one, after css4j, should be called \"Styled XHTML\"  \nrrodriguez - (23:20): let me process these five last entries; I don't remember what this stuff means  \nsdumitriu - (23:21): K  \nsdumitriu - (23:21): One more note and I'm done  \nrrodriguez - (23:21): K  \nrrodriguez - (23:21): Too much time working with genes kills the neuron! :-)  \nsdumitriu - (23:21): In the explanatory note, \"style + pdf.css\" should be reversed, \"pdf.css + style\"  \nlucaa - (23:22): sdumitriu: is there any way I can fire the annotation update events muself?  \nlucaa - (23:22): myself  \nsdumitriu - (23:22): lucaa: Sure  \nlucaa - (23:22): in the annotation module that is  \nrrodriguez - (23:23): sdumitriu: I don't remember why I bolded style  \nsdumitriu - (23:23): That would be much better actually  \nlucaa - (23:23): ok, I will do that  \nlucaa - (23:23): because otherwise there is no way to implement http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XAANNOTATIONS-35  \nlucaa - (23:23): as described there  \nrrodriguez - (23:23): sdumitriu: Must I keep \\*\\*style\\*\\* bolded?  \nsdumitriu - (23:23): rrodriguez: No, \"much better\" was for lucaa  \nrrodriguez - (23:24): K  \nlucaa - (23:24): yey yey, I get much better, I get much better, na na nana na  \nlucaa - (23:24): :)  \nlucaa - (23:24): (sorry it's late), don't take it personally rrodriguez  \nrrodriguez - (23:25): :-)  \nlpereira left at 23:25 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa - (23:26): sdumitriu: \u00a0cool so I will remove the part dedicated to AnnotationCode.AnnotationClass events in the onEvent and i will fire from the annotation io module  \nsdumitriu - (23:26): Yep  \nsdumitriu - (23:27): Hoping that nobody really updates annotations from the object editor  \nlucaa - (23:28): well, if they do, then it's an object update  \nlucaa - (23:29): and handled like any other object update  \nsdumitriu - (23:29): Yes  \nlucaa - (23:32): sdumitriu: how about the date? should it update?  \nlucaa - (23:32): or it stays always to the creation date?  \nlucaa - (23:32): I hesitate a bit, because it doesn't make sense to declare an annotation as from the update date  \nlucaa - (23:33): so I could leave it to the creation date  \nlucaa - (23:33): as in never update annotation date  \nrrodriguez - (23:42): sdumitriu: could you check it, please, http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/AdminGuide/Configuration/XWikiExport201010272340.png  \nlucaa - (23:46): sdumitriu: but, even if I launch the annotation events myself, there still is an issue, the document save  \nlucaa - (23:46): is there a param I can pass to the document save to bypass the notification?  \nrrodriguez - (23:46): sdumitriu: I would modify \"Incoming Exporto to PDF....\"; I would write simply \"Export to PDF or Export to RTF request\" A request is always an \"incoming\" call. Do you agree?  \njvelociter - (23:47): could it be the AS patch that broke the scheduler ?  \njvelociter - (23:48): sounds like it in terms of timing  \njvelociter - (23:48): the XE buid from Oct 26, 2010 8:35:52 AM introduced many failures  \nsdumitriu - (23:53): rrodriguez: I'm back  \nrrodriguez - (23:54): K!  \nsdumitriu - (23:54): +1 for removing \"incoming\"  \nsdumitriu - (23:55): The rest of the changes are OK  \nsdumitriu - (23:55): What I said was to move the XWiki.PDFClass#xhtmlxsl node between xhtml.xsl and Apache Xalan  \nrrodriguez - (23:55): K! I'll update it now  \nrrodriguez - (23:56): let me see  \nsdumitriu - (23:56): and XWiki.PDFClass#fopxsl between fop.xsl and Apache FOP  \nsdumitriu - (23:57): Hm, also replace \"include the rendered content\" with \"include the rendered document content\"  \nrrodriguez - (23:57): K  \nsdumitriu - (23:57): And then it should be perfect  \nrrodriguez - (23:58): give me some minutes, I've to put out a fire!  \nsdumitriu - (23:59): Sur  \nsdumitriu - (23:59): e  \n\n"}
