Still waiting for someone to review / integrate the changes  \n11:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, I just checked, and I have at most minor issues (some hardwired css colors). Additionally this is a \"display only\", so you cannot move stuff around, as I first thought  \n11:56\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ClemensR: would be great if you could make the comments on the PR. the problem is that I don't think the contributor will have time to make the changes.  \n11:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is likely to be somewhat inefficient if there are many issues, but I guess that is ok-if you have too many issues for the page to load, you might have another problem :)  \n11:58\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0actually I see no problem with merging this from a technical side, I guess getting rid of the \"hard wired\" CSS colors would be quite hard (one need to write a separate \"status color management page\" or add a \"color\" attribute to the status objects ...  \n12:00\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0if you think it's ok - you should merge it. It's a nice functionality to integrate - even if there will be small problems with it  \n12:01\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes I think it is good enough for a merge. as I understand it is ok for you too, then I am going to merge it  \n12:01\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0ClemensR: thanks  \n12:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:19\u00a0<Azitrex>\u00a0has quit  \n13:29\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n15:15\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:47\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n15:47\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n15:48\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:12\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has quit  \n16:32\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:49\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n16:50\u00a0<RamonaConoro>\u00a0has quit  \n16:56\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:57\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:00\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n17:05\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n17:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:44\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n17:49\u00a0<julien>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:49\u00a0<julien>\u00a0bonjour \u00e0 tous  \n17:49\u00a0<julien>\u00a0is now known as <Guest94090>  \n17:50\u00a0<Guest94090>\u00a0j'ai un probleme avec xwiki 6.4  \n18:04\u00a0<Guest94090>\u00a0pourrais-je avoir un peu d'aide svp ?  \n18:07\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:13\u00a0<Guest94090>\u00a0Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.xwiki.search.solr.internal.XWikiDismaxQParserPlugin  \n18:13\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n19:13\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:15\u00a0<Guest94090>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:54\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:14\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:17\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:39\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:40\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:40\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0is now known as <momomomomo>  \n20:40\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n20:43\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan>  \n20:50\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:59\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:01\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:11\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:24\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has quit  \n21:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:01\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n22:04\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0is now known as <sburjan>  \n22:07\u00a0<momomomomo\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n22:45\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:48\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:57\u00a0<vrachieru>\u00a0has quit\n"}
