I have the impression that the table headings were generated inside a thead element but now I see that they are inside tbody. This fixes one of my issues XWIKI-4533 but I'm interested in what made you change the renderer.  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea1: hmm I don't know but I remember Thomas modified it at some point  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to support headers as columns and as lines I think  \n09:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but not sure it's related to what you mention)  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0getXHTMLWikiPrinter().printXMLStartElement(\"th\", parametersWithScope);  \n09:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in beginTableHeadCell()  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i don't see any tbody  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in XHTMLChainingRenderer)  \n09:55\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0hmm, I double checked and the thead is generated by the editor. So, when you insert the table from wiki syntax and switch to WYSIWYG the row with TH cells is inside TBODY, but if you insert a table from the WYSIWYG editor, the row with TH cells is inside THEAD element  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I doubt that the tbody is coming from the rendering  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless it's the cleaner  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(which is outside the rendering)  \n09:57\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0indeed, the WYSIWYG editor input is: <table><tr><th scope=\"col\">Foo</th><th scope=\"col\">Bar</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr></table>  \n09:57\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0the TBODY is added by the browser when building the DOM tree  \n10:00\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I should change the WYSIWYG editor to generate the same thing when inserting a table from the editor  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we could change the renderer too if the browser's version is more correct  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we need to decide which version we want  \n10:01\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0well, I looked at the DTD and tr inside table is valid  \n10:01\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0<!ELEMENT table \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(caption?, (col\\*|colgroup\\*), thead?, tfoot?, (tbody+|tr+))>  \n10:01\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0so the rendering generates valid XHTML  \n10:01\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:04\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n10:05\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n10:05\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:06\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n10:06\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:07\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:10\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n10:19\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:01\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0hi devs, in XWiki 2.4, while using action 'get' and 'outputSyntax=plain', we have an issue that breaks our JSON due to removal of XWiki syntax in the rendered content.
