I think there's an open jira for this from Anca  \n10:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the use case?  \n10:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can think of http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13402 but it's not strictly related to this  \n10:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0the use case: I want forbidden subdirectory creation  \n10:28\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0\"I\" is my boss :-)  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not a use case  \n10:29\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0or simply limit subdirectoy deeph  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the use case? (ie what's the rationale)  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's just the consequence  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why is your boss not saying this for this filesystem for example?  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/this/his  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he's probably on windows and employees can create subdirectories no?  \n10:30\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0we use a space like an encyclopedy and he wxant all page in ths space without sublevel  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so it's only for a specific space  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not for the whole wiki  \n10:31\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes :-)  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well easy  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just create terminal pages  \n10:31\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0thinking (I didn't chack acl)  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0encyclopedia pages should be created as terminal  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so they cannot have children  \n10:31\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0wow is it so simple?  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and offer a form to create new encyclopedia pages  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that it's set to terminal by default when users create those pages  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not perfect  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it's a workaround for your needs  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't know if it's good enough, you tell me :)  \n10:33\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ok thxs it is a way  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case it won't hurt to create a jira issue improvement, it's just not there now and I don't know when someone will have time to work on this  \n10:34\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Then there aren't a deeph nested parameter?  \n10:34\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Ok I could  \n10:34\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:35\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0because I'm thinking if users creating too much sub level , it will be a mess after year (maybe)  \n10:36\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0(like filesytem on some Samba shared)  \n10:36\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0on some Samba network share pardon  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Then there aren't a deeph nested parameter?\" no there isn't  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't see why it would be more a mess than being flat....  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0having 100000 docs in the same space or in various spaces is the same mess IMO :)  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(actually more messy in a flat structure I think)  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a wiki needs gardening anyway  \n10:43\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0for sure :-D  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(like any collaboration system)  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if you want a limit on number of spaces you should also want a limit on number of documents in a given space IMO. But I'm not sure it's a good idea  \n10:44\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0but il is better to avoid mess problem instead fix it by gardenner  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless there are other reasons that we haven't listed yet for limiting the hierarchy size  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: so you don't agree that a flat structure is as messy?  \n10:45\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0... depending of use case  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let me say one thing  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the original goal of a wiki is to be messy  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order to provide serendipity  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now XWiki has a solution for this  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) allows some part of the wiki to be \"messy\" (ie free structure)  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) allow other part to be controlled with structure apps  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*structured  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if you want order in the encyclopedia part you need to build a small app for that  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then you'll control the organizational structure  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since it's the app that creates the pages and decides where to put them and it also control the content since it provides a structure)  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the beauty of XWiki :)  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can have both  \n10:48\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0yes I agree about wiki spirit , but the shame, everyone didn't have write access (on intranet) \u00a0big boss decision :-/  \n10:50\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Ok I understand than limiting depth of nested page would be a regression :-)  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Pbas: btw are you on XWiki 7.4+ ?  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or still on 6.x)  \n10:51\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0nope 7.0.1 and I must upgrade it to 8.2.1  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n10:52\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0It will be second upgrade since 6.x version  \n10:53\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0ty to show me the light of serendipity (I didn't know this word) ;-)  \n11:17\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's my favorite word :)  \n11:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:33\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0:-D  \n11:51\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:53\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n12:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:14\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:48\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:22\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n14:41\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n15:33\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:24\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n17:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:15\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<evalica1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:57\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:01\u00a0<gene>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<gene>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n19:07\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:08\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n19:09\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:10\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n20:29\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n20:29\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:37\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:51\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:53\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:14\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n21:16\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:19\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:22\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n22:02\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n22:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:52\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit\n"}
