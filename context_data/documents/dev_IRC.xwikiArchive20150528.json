 \n14:40\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0well now it's 4 minutes, and still initializing at 0%  \n14:40\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0happens every time i restart tomcat  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you mean it take 4 minutes before you get the initialization progress even starting ?  \n14:41\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0it takes 2 mins for the progress to start  \n14:41\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0then it gets stuck another 2-3 on 0%, and then it goes to connection timed out  \n14:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then nothing to do with the database  \n14:42\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0then i do refresh in the browser, and boum it loads instantly  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you won't have any progress anyway in that version  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's been broken  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you just see it once the init is finished  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-12113  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you see the progress it means XWiki instance is initialized, then it start loading the first page  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0initialize XWiki is not something instant, but you are not supposed to restart Tomcat all the time either  \n14:45\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0i know it's not instant  \n14:45\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0but nothing is happening in htop either  \n14:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a few minutes for the whole init and first page load sounds expected to me  \n14:46\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0on a fresh install?

 \n14:47\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0this is 6 vcores, 8 GB RAM, and so on  \n14:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0many thing, the init is loading a lot of document, reading lot of things on the filesystem, Solr has to populate the index the first time  \n14:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should let it run a bit and then try to see how restarts goes  \n14:49\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0i'll start from scratch, i have used 6.X before, and i never saw so long loading times  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I agree that 5 minutes is a lot  \n14:49\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0especially since the init results in an error, not a successful load  \n14:49\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0even if it takes 10 mins or so  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you get an error you obviously have an issue anyway  \n14:50\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0connection timed out  \n14:50\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0is the error  \n14:50\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0and when i reload the page, then it's there  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0except for really profiling what is happening exactly I don't have much idea of what can be so slow in your case  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I never use pgsql but I don't see what XWiki would be a lot slower with it than mysql  \n14:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/what/why/  \n14:52\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0http://pastie.org/private/bsdhtydhezxfmqrpreuzig  \n14:52\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0this is my setup instructions  \n14:52\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0there's nothing strange in there or?

 \n16:02\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0at this point i'm tempted...  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have 2 options:  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- use tomcat 7  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- use the WAR install  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we recommend tomcat7 ATM I'd suggest you continue with deb but with tomcat7  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that even possible or is the version of tomcat fixed?

 \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no idea  \n16:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex1: as far as I can see TCP6 means TCP on IPV6, does not have anything to do with the port  \n16:50\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0so tomcat shouldn't bind on ipv4 on port 8080 ?  \n16:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0depends of your system and tomcat setup I guess  \n16:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWiki does not setup Tomcat it just register itself as servlet  \n16:51\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0out of the box Debina 8  \n16:51\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0just tell me which distro to use  \n16:51\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0lol  \n16:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0never used Debian 8 myself so I can't really tell you how it's supposed to be by default  \n16:56\u00a0<Trefex1>\u00a0so what distro you do most tests on?
