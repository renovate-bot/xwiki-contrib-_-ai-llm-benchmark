I wrote a draft on dynamic custom mapping.

We haven't defined a \"length of stay\" yet though ATM ...  \nvmassol - (10:30): evalica: you're only thinking about the result, not about the cost  \nvmassol - (10:30): of course it would be great  \nvmassol - (10:31): and of course it would be great that the xwiki doc be perfect  \nvmassol - (10:31): and so on  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:31): Tutorials may be a special case because they don't usually change much after they are written.  \nvmassol - (10:31): you need to associate the cost otherwise it's only wishful thinking  \nvmassol - (10:31): CalebJamesDeLisl: they do and they should, we have already a few we can't even maintain in engmish  \nvmassol - (10:31): enligsh  \nvmassol - (10:31): and they need to be rewritten  \nvmassol - (10:32): guys I need to move and reconnect in 1 mn  \nvmassol left at 10:32 (Quit: Leaving.  \nSvenDowideit\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:34  \nSvenDowideit left at 10:34 (Ping timeout: 248 seconds  \nSvenDowideit\\_ is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 10:36  \nSvenDowideit\\_ joined #xwiki at 10:37  \nvmassol - (10:37): back  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:38): Maybe the problem is there is an implication that information must meet high standard which many would be contributors don't feel they can reach.  \nvmassol - (10:38): yes  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:39): I remember wishing I could suggest changes rather than making them thus asserting their correctness.  \nvmassol - (10:39): it's always the szme  \nvmassol - (10:39): you have to decide between:  \nvmassol - (10:39): - good for users  \nvmassol - (10:39): or  \nvmassol - (10:39): - good for contributors  \nSvenDowi- joined #xwiki at 10:39  \nvmassol - (10:39): so far I've never seen a system that has both qualities  \ntmortagne - (10:40): annotations could be used by contributor not sage enough to modify the page  \nvmassol - (10:40): with little money invested of course  \nSvenDowideit left at 10:40 (Ping timeout: 248 seconds  \nSvenDowi- is now known as SvenDowideit ([[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  \nsdumitriu - (10:40): Translations work when the original is stable  \ntmortagne - (10:40): s/sage/safe/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:40): xwiki.org is never really stable.  \nvmassol - (10:40): tmortagne: yes but annotations is like comments, it's not modifying the doc.

 \nvmassol - (10:58): it's like a patch  \nvmassol - (10:59): (kind of)  \nvmassol - (10:59): but yes I agree  \nSvenDowideit\\_ left at 10:59 (Ping timeout: 246 seconds  \nvmassol - (10:59): thatr's why I was pushing for contribution data on the home page  \nvmassol - (10:59): to make good contributors known  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (10:59): I need my patch committed so I don't have to apply it to each version. Docs are different.  \nSvenDowideit joined #xwiki at 10:59  \nvmassol - (11:00): CalebJamesDeLisl: why do you document in the first place then?  \nvmassol - (11:00): you document because you want to give back something, help others  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:00): Because (in my case) there was absolutely no documentation and I wanted to share what I learned.  \nvmassol - (11:00): you help them more if your doc is in the official doc  \nvmassol - (11:00): so that's the incentive  \nvmassol - (11:01): better visibility  \nvmassol - (11:01): but we definitely need to list all doc contributors and authors on a page  \nvmassol - (11:01): and make them be known  \nvmassol - (11:01): like authors in a book  \nvmassol - (11:02): it's just not very easy to do  \nvmassol - (11:02): (manual process right now)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:02): I don't think it's as much of a ego thing so visibility isn't much of an incentive. My feeling is if it exists, those who need it will find it.  \nlucaa left at 11:02 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (11:02): CalebJamesDeLisl: then why not put the doc in your own blog for ex?  \nvmassol - (11:03): (for those who have a blog)  \nvmassol - (11:03): it'll get less visibility for sure, but findable through google  \nxenon75 joined #xwiki at 11:03  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:03): (My case) I have none. I think it's important to make it easy to contribute so others don't do just that.  \nvmassol - (11:03): personally I don't see why I would spend time writing a doc  \nvmassol - (11:03): if I don't want it to be visible  \nvmassol - (11:04): so I'll choose the best place so that it's visible to all  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:04): To make sure I remember how dynamic custom mapping works ;)  \nvmassol - (11:04): ok so it's for you only  \nvmassol - (11:05): (as number 1 incentive)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:05): And I wanted to share it with the other people who are dealing with hibernateStore on that level.  \nvmassol - (11:05): number 2 incentive  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:06): But they will have no problem finding it because that's about all you get googling xwiki dynamic custom mapping.  \nvmassol - (11:06): yes with google we could almost have no doc on any given site and just return search results for each topic  \nvmassol - (11:06): (thus aggregating the world)  \nvmassol - (11:07): there's a bit too much noise though  \nvmassol - (11:07): and that's the pb with your doc  \nvmassol - (11:07): it's not integrated in the main doc  \nvmassol - (11:07): meaning it's out of context  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:07): Also for an author to push their doc means the author must think the doc is very valuable.  \nvmassol - (11:08): the hard part in writing docs is not writing the content  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:08): Some people think their work is the best thing since sliced bread, others feel that someone else needs to validate it.  \nvmassol - (11:08): it's about integrating it in an existing flow  \nvmassol - (11:08): so that it makes sense in that flow  \nvmassol - (11:08): coherent  \nvmassol - (11:08): it's like patches  \nvmassol - (11:08): people who send patches do 1% of the work  \nvmassol - (11:09): there's 99% left in general  \nvmassol - (11:09): review, fix bugs, write tests, write docs, redesign, etc  \nvmassol - (11:09): it's the same for docs  \nvmassol - (11:09): it's easy to write something out of context  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:09): I think that is going to be our job, it's hard for us to expect that of (documentation) contributors.  \nvmassol - (11:09): but to make it good quality, integrated, easy to read, etc is hard  \nvmassol - (11:09): and takes time  \nvmassol - (11:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: yes  \nvmassol - (11:10): I personally spend several hours per week on xwiki.org  \nvmassol - (11:11): if we want good docs there we all need to do this I believe  \nvmassol - (11:11): we = committers  \nvmassol - (11:11): and power users  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:11): I am in favor of the idea that the author presents their work and then somebody else moves it into the main area, thus validating the contributor's work.  \nvmassol - (11:11): luckily silviar has been helping a lot recently on this too  \nvmassol - (11:12): CalebJamesDeLisl: I don't quite agree  \nvmassol - (11:12): \u00a0but almost  \nvmassol - (11:12): :)  \nvmassol - (11:12): present their work yes  \nvmassol - (11:12): then a discussion about a how to intergate it ensues  \nvmassol - (11:12): and then the author moves it as discussed  \nvmassol - (11:12): then committers can review the final work again and fine tune little details  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:13): I (for example) would rather offer something than push it.  \nvmassol - (11:15): of course you would!  \nvmassol - (11:15): offloading work to others is always easier  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:15): When I write something I don't think that it's worthy of inclusion in the main docs so I put it in drafts.  \nvmassol - (11:15): and you leave it for someone else to do that hard work  \nvmassol - (11:15): with that thinking we would only have disjointed docs on xwiki;org  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:16): I suppose I should then pick up the slack by getting others' work included.  \nvmassol - (11:16): like a wiki implemented using google docs ;)  \nvmassol - (11:16): all topics one below another  \nvmassol - (11:16): with no context joining them  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:17): Also I tend to avoid xwiki.org for fear of stepping on toes.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 11:17  \nvmassol - (11:17): yes that's a fear that always exists when something has a \"finished\" look  \nvmassol - (11:17): (which is why I was mentioned the \"good for users\" vs \"good for contributors\")  \nvmassol - (11:17): \\*mentionning  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:18): Interesting. Reminds me of a piece of artwork which is intentionally left unfinished to call the viewer to action.  \nvmassol - (11:18): yep good analogy  \nvmassol - (11:19): I've been thinking about this for years  \nvmassol - (11:19): in all my past projects  \nvmassol - (11:19): I even blogged about it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:19): There must be an algorithm :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:21): I think we can start by having a formal method for getting drafts moved into the main docs.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:22): Some authors think their docs are valuable and will push to get them on the front page. Others need a second opinion to say their docs are valuable before trying to put them in the main section.  \nvmassol - (11:24): re the formal method +1  \nvmassol - (11:24): it can be added to http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/ at the top  \nvmassol - (11:24): you could send a mail on the dev list to agree on it and then add it there wdyt?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:25): The author sends the mail?  \nvmassol - (11:25): in the contributing section we should also explain it a bit more about the structure of the xwiki.org site I believe  \nvmassol - (11:25): yes the author could send the mail  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 11:26  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:26): That would be one way. I think some authors need someone else to validate their work.  \nanamarias - (11:26): hi  \nanamarias - (11:27): What is the xwiki behavior in the following case:  \nanamarias - (11:27): You have a document (doc1) with a button, which when you click it modifies the content of another document (doc2).  \nanamarias - (11:27): When happens if doc2 is currently being edited by another user?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:27): If the button posts to the save action, the document is modified anyway.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:28): Then when the other user saves it's reverted.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:28): (AFAIK)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:29): Locks only work if one explicitly checks to see if the document is locked.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:29): $doc.getLocked() I think.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:30): Behavior is same for Document.save() locks are ignored.  \nanamarias - (11:30): I didn't know about doc.getLocked, sounds useful  \nlucaa - (11:30): and when a user has started editing it, it should be locked. So when doc1 wants to save doc2, you can check for locks first to see if noone is currently editing it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:31): getLocked() and getLockingUser() is another one if I remember correctly...  \nanamarias - (11:31): lucaa: and display a warning or smth when clicking the button on doc1 ?  \nlucaa - (11:32): well, this is another issue. Yes you can display a warning  \nanamarias - (11:32): because I didn't see anywhere implemented this kind of behavior in xwiki  \nlucaa - (11:32): well, yes you did  \nlucaa - (11:32): when you edit concurently a page with someone  \nlucaa - (11:32): like X has opened a page in edit mode, Y wants to open it too in edit mode  \nlucaa - (11:32): you get a message  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 11:32  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:33): Yes I think one of the edit templates does the $doc.getLocked() check.  \nlucaa - (11:33): saying that document is locked by X and if you want you can \"force the lock\"  \nanamarias - (11:33): oh that one yes, I was referring more to custom features build on xwiki  \nlucaa - (11:34): anamarias: well they should all be careful about these situations  \nlucaa - (11:34): (which makes me think, I should really make a test on annotations :) )  \nlucaa - (11:35): however, to check if the save is overriding the whole document or only the part modified  \nlucaa - (11:35): namely, if Y saves and closes and then X saves and closes  \nlucaa - (11:36): the modifications of Y would be lost, because X has overridden them with his own version that he was editing  \nlucaa - (11:37): to check if this save (Ys save) affects the objects in the document or only the document content that X and Y have submitted to the save form  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:37): It would be cool to do a svn style check.... \u00a0\"Your copy is old because you never svn up!\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:38): Then their would be merging to avoid losing their data.  \nanamarias - (11:38): lucaa: thanks  \nlucaa - (11:38): CalebJamesDeLisl: yes, it would be very nice to get rid of this lock system and implement a merge based algo  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:39): Api2.0 :)  \nanamarias - (11:40): what if need the HTML content rendered from a small piece of WIKI syntax, and I need to insert it into a page (with AJAX) ?  \nanamarias - (11:40): make a call to a document which uses $xwiki.renderText(java.lang.String text, Document doc)  \nanamarias - (11:41): ?  \nanamarias - (11:41): and then return the resulted HTML ?  \nlucaa - (11:41): yes, something like that  \nlucaa - (11:41): or you build a template  \nlucaa - (11:41): add it in your skin  \nanamarias - (11:41): what kind of template?  \nlucaa - (11:42): and do:  \nlucaa - (11:42): xwiki/bin/get/MySpace/MyPage?xpage=mytemplate  \nlucaa - (11:42): a template like view.vm, or edit.vm or all those in skin  \nanamarias - (11:42): my text is usually a macro call  \nanamarias - (11:43): text='{{somemacro param1=paramvalue1.../}}'  \nlucaa - (11:43): ah, sorry misunderstood  \nlucaa - (11:43): you need to pass this as a parameter  \nlucaa - (11:43): the text  \nlucaa - (11:44): well, both versions work because you can pass parameters to code in templates too, it's going to be $request.text as well  \nlucaa - (11:44): but skin templates are a bit harder to install  \nanamarias - (11:44): right  \nlucaa - (11:44): because you need people to either override their XWiki.DefaultSkin with your skin, or merge it manually.  \nlucaa - (11:45): well, yes, page that calls the renderText is good enough imo  \nlucaa - (11:45): to check the REST api maybe it has something for you  \nanamarias - (11:45): where is that?  \nlucaa - (11:45): jas, to find the doc  \nlucaa - (11:46): here you go http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI  \nanamarias - (11:46): hmm nice!  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:47): If you are in javascript there is the preview action which is very cool.  \nlucaa - (11:47): also, you can check the code if you want after reading the documentation, is in http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-rest/  \nanamarias - (11:47): CalebJamesDeLisl: in JS, yes. What kind of preview are you referring to?  \nlucaa - (11:47): yes, preview should do the job  \nlucaa - (11:48): the preview action (such as view, edit, inline, etc)  \nlucaa - (11:48): when you edit a doc and then say \"preview\" to see how it would look  \nlucaa - (11:48): that's an xwiki action  \nanamarias - (11:48): doesn't it send you to a new url ?  \nlucaa - (11:48): yes, but you would just request that URL  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:48): You just post to the preview action on any page which you have access to and it responds with the output.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:48): http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extensions/ProgrammingRightTestGreasemonkeyExtension  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:49): That greasemonkey script posts a PR check to the user's user page in preview mode.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:49): I chose the user page because we know the user has edit access on it.  \nanamarias - (11:49): ok, I see what you mean, however I need smth moro dynamic (no url change, just ajax)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:50): if you post to /preview/XWiki/Me?xpage=plain then you just get the rendered syntax.  \nlucaa - (11:51): but you wouldn't be changing the url of the current page, you just post to that URL and get the result, the same way you'd send the ajax call to the script that uses renderText to render and return result  \nlucaa - (11:52): because that's what the preview action does, renders the text you send in the context of the current page, which is exactly what you'd plan to reimplement in the script you want to write  \nlucaa left at 11:53 (Quit: Leaving.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:53): The user needs to have edit access on the page which the script is previewing though.  \nlucaa joined #xwiki at 11:53  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): tmortagne: is this correct behavior?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): a{{html}}{{/html}}\\n=b=  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): outputs  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): <p>a<br/></p><h1 id=\"Hb\"><span>b</span></h1>  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): and  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): a{{html}}{{/html}}a\\n=b=  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): outputs  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): <p>aa</p><h1 id=\"Hb\"><span>b</span></h1>  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:57): That <br/> looks out of place, I wanted to verify it with you.  \ntmortagne - (11:59): CalebJamesDeLisl: it's a bug, i created a jira issue, let me find it  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (12:00): You don't have to bother.
