My translation bundle, from where I want to overwrite the key is probably loaded before so it doesn't have any effect.  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I was thinking to \"force\" loading my translation bundle on demand, but it is also loaded on wiki, so it doesn't work (the location manager probably detects that the bundle is already loaded and doesn't do nothing).  \n10:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0my last resort is to define a separate bundle that contains only the key I want to overwrite and load this on demand in the places where the key is used  \n10:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0TranslationBundle API have the concept of priority but all wiki based bundle provide the same priority, need to add a priority field in TranslationDocumentClass  \n11:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\"it doesn't work\" not sure what you means here  \n11:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you change from wiki to on demand and it's not taken into account ?  \n11:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea:  \n11:02\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no, I can't change from wiki to ondemand because I have keys that are used in many places (including AJAX requests). That's why I said that in the end I'll have to use a separate bundle that is loaded on demand and which has only the keys that I want to overwrite  \n11:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0fortunately, in my case the key I want to overwrite is used in a single place  \n11:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so I can load on demand there this separate bundle  \n11:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0just so that it overwrites the default key  \n11:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne:  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so you tried to use it both at wiki level and on demande, the reason it did not worked is because the bundled are stored in a set in the context  \n11:05\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep, I thought so  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0plus another issue for this use case any way is that it's a SortedSet  \n11:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sorted based on priority  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually it's not an issue  \n11:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0how does it decide the priority? we can't specify a priority for a document translation bundle, at least not from the wiki page  \n11:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(10:58:47 AM) tmortagne: TranslationBundle API have the concept of priority but all wiki based bundle provide the same priority, need to add a priority field in TranslationDocumentClass  \n11:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that would be nice  \n11:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and would fit my use case  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes, mostly forgot about it  \n11:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0plus it's pretty easy to do  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you want to look at it it's in AbstractDocumentTranslationBundle  \n11:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now it does setPriority(DEFAULTPRIORITY\\_WIKI); but ideally it should look at the document first  \n11:09\u00a0<ImRG>\u00a0has quit  \n11:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, on my side I need it for procedure flavor, which is still depending on 8.4 so I can't use the latest version yet  \n11:10\u00a0<ImRG>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0creating a jira issue for it, looks like I forgot  \n11:14\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:18\u00a0<ImRG>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:31\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:32\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:32\u00a0<Enygma`2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: document translation bundles loaded on demand don't seem to have priority over those loaded on wiki. My workaround (loading a separate bundle on demand to overwrite a key) doesn't work.  \n11:36\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:37\u00a0<Enygma`2>\u00a0has quit  \n11:39\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: yes all wiki resource have the same priority, I tough you would gest last added bundled with same priori first but does not seems to be the case DefaultTranslationBundleContext should probably make sure of that  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now it just use a SortedSet  \n11:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok  \n11:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like SortedSet give priority to first things added  \n11:40\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n11:43\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n11:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:36\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:36\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n13:20\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:13\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:19\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:20\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:23\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:23\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:27\u00a0<Enygma`1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:00\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:22\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:39\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0hey guys  \n15:40\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0long time no see  \n15:41\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0Im on xwiki entreprise 8.2.1, is it a fast / good way to update to the 8.4.4 ?  \n15:45\u00a0<woshilap1n>\u00a0has quit  \n15:45\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n15:45\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:48\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:38\u00a0<claakmann>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:42\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:42\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:43\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n17:01\u00a0<claakmann>\u00a0hi guys...
