Re the new LinkType I'd prefer not to allow for null but instead have the default for documents be the short form (ie without the doc prefix). wdyt? Otherwise there are lots of place where you have to write: if linkType == null || linkType == LinkType.DOCUMENT which isn't nice at all and very risky  \ntmortagne - (11:51): vmassol: problem is that the fact that DOCUMENT is the default a a XWiki thing, in a basic rendering it will be an URL by default  \ntmortagne - (11:51): which for me make it wrong to decide the default in the parser  \nvmassol - (11:51): that's not a pb, we test for wikimodel == null  \nsdumitriu - (11:52): sburjan: http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/com/xpn/xwiki/products/xwiki-enterprise-installer-generic/2.5-milestone-1/xwiki-enterprise-installer-generic-2.5-milestone-1-standard.jar is ready, too  \nvmassol - (11:52): we do'nt decide default in the parser  \nvmassol - (11:52): parser just says that type is DOCUMENT  \nvmassol - (11:52): it's in the renderer that we decide a default  \ntmortagne - (11:53): \"we do'nt decide default in the parser\" <> \"parser just says that type is DOCUMENT\"  \ntmortagne - (11:53): theses are the opposite  \nvmassol - (11:54): we use defaults in lots of places in the syntax  \nvmassol - (11:54): so it makes sense to have a default to me  \nsburjan` - (11:57): sdumitriu: thanks  \ncjdelisle - (11:58): has anyone tried threaded building in maven3?  \nsdumitriu - (12:00): Not me  \nsdumitriu - (12:01): sburjan: .zip seems to work fine  \nsburjan` - (12:01): sdumitriu : yes.. i started testing it.

If the key is always unique (from an identity standpoint) then the synchronized block does nothing.  \ncjdelisle - (16:19): key1.equals(key2) && key1 != key2  \ncjdelisle - (16:20): Cache works fine, just the synchronized statement does nothing.  \ntmortagne - (16:20): don't we maintains some kind of key cache  \ntmortagne - (16:20): ?  \ntmortagne - (16:20): i think i remember something like that  \ncjdelisle - (16:20): line 180: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0String key = getKey(doc, context);  \ncjdelisle - (16:20): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0synchronized (key) {  \ntmortagne - (16:20): sure but i'm talking about getKey  \ncjdelisle - (16:21): Same which I used in the test groovy script I wrote.  \ntmortagne - (16:21): i just checked and getKey just create a new key each time indeed  \ntmortagne - (16:21): then yes the synchronize do absolutely nothing  \ncjdelisle - (16:22): The question I have is do we fis the synchronized statement or remove it and assume it doesn't matter since it has never been a noticeable problem?  \ntmortagne - (16:24): well it should be a problem actually, it's weird we never notice it  \ncjdelisle - (16:25): What do you expect to happen when the bug shows itself?  \ntmortagne - (16:25): you could get concurrent access issue when someone save the document and another get it  \ntmortagne - (16:25): i guess the same key is used to synchronize in save  \ntmortagne - (16:26): s/key/kind of key/  \ntmortagne - (16:26): actually no  \ntmortagne - (16:26): we would not have this  \ntmortagne - (16:26): because the cache is threadsafe  \ncjdelisle - (16:27): I was just going to check that.  \ncjdelisle - (16:27): So what do you think about removing the synchronized blocks?  \ntmortagne - (16:27): so it would just be a matter of someone manipulating a XWikiDocument that is not in the cache anymore because another one overwritted it because they loaded it at the same time  \ntmortagne - (16:27): so it should not be very noticable even is not very clean  \ncjdelisle - (16:28): \"someone manipulating a XWikiDocument that is not in the cache anymore\"?  \ntmortagne - (16:28): s/is not/if not/  \ntmortagne - (16:28): two use load a documents almost at the same time  \ntmortagne - (16:29): the first one will get a XwikiDocument imediatly ovewritten in the cache by the second one  \ntmortagne - (16:29): so his XWikiDocument instance is not in the cache anymore  \ncjdelisle - (16:29): The cache clones everything on load IIRC.  \ncjdelisle - (16:29): I called getDocument a bunch of times and checked identity, always different.  \ntmortagne - (16:30): not in loadXWikiDoc AFAICS  \ntmortagne - (16:30): maybe XWiki#getDocument does that  \ncjdelisle - (16:31): I did that because I was concerned about cache corruption. EG: load admin document, change password, log in real quick.  \ntmortagne - (16:31): and AFAIK it's not supposed to be cloned anyway  \ntmortagne - (16:32): did what ?  \ntmortagne - (16:32): loadXWikiDoc is not cloning anything  \ncjdelisle - (16:32): tested to see if the cache always returns the same document (identity)  \ntmortagne - (16:33): well it supposed to  \ncjdelisle - (16:33): hmm. indeed it does as of this test.  \ntmortagne - (16:33): i don't know how you tested but the cache does not clone for sure for what i can see in the code  \ntmortagne - (16:34): (and for what i know)  \ncjdelisle - (16:34): nope it's getDocument. My mistake.  \ncjdelisle - (16:35): it's api.XWiki#getDocument to be exact.  \ntmortagne - (16:35): even getDocument does not seems to clone  \ntmortagne - (16:35): return getStore().loadXWikiDoc(doc, context);  \ncjdelisle - (16:35): created a new api.Document each time  \ntmortagne - (16:36): Document yes  \ntmortagne - (16:36): that's normal  \ntmortagne - (16:36): but i was talking about XWikiDocument  \ncjdelisle - (16:36): So we must comb api.Document to make sure \\_every\\_ possible change causes it to clone, otherwise cache poising is possible.  \nkwoot left at 16:37 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \ncjdelisle - (16:38): \"the first one will get a XwikiDocument imediatly ovewritten in the cache\" so this means you getDocument and while you're holding it, the document is updated --> race condition.  \ntmortagne - (16:39): yes that's what i said  \ncjdelisle - (16:40): IMO this is no different from 2 people editing a document at the same time and the answer for now is to lock the document until it's saved.  \ntmortagne - (16:40): but it does not change much for the user  \ntmortagne - (16:40): the last that save win  \ntmortagne - (16:40): as usual  \ntmortagne - (16:40): yep  \ncjdelisle - (16:41): So we can safely drop all of those synchronized statements then.  \ntmortagne - (16:41): we can safely drop all of them because they don't do anything anyway ;)  \ntmortagne - (16:41): the only thing i'm not sure is how thread safe hibernate is  \ntmortagne - (16:41): but i guess it's ok  \nsilviar left at 16:41 (Quit: Leaving.  \ncjdelisle - (16:42): What is the concern? I can't visualize a hibernate level bug.  \ncjdelisle - (16:42): 2 transactions update the same document --> crash?  \ntmortagne - (16:43): no that is probably the last one wins, but you could get mixed documents maybe  \ntmortagne - (16:43): with some modification of one and some of another  \ntmortagne - (16:43): since we don't save all that at one  \ntmortagne - (16:44): there is the document, the object, the attachements, etc.  \ntmortagne - (16:44): same for loading a document while it's saved  \ncjdelisle - (16:44): The attachments are now inside of the document transaction :D  \ncjdelisle - (16:45): Actually IIRC, the objects are as well.  \ntmortagne - (16:45): it's different requests  \ntmortagne - (16:45): and mysql does not care about transaction  \ncjdelisle - (16:45): If you have 2 transactions and you end up with a mix, it's the database to blame.  \ncjdelisle - (16:46): If some db software (mysql) has threading problems, that's not our fault IMO.  \ntmortagne - (16:47): sure but we use mysql 99% of the time :)  \ncjdelisle - (16:48): Yea. I think the postgres problem is that on save you have to specify the 'schema' explicitly.  \ncjdelisle - (16:49): Do you know anything about the synchronized block in SaveDocument?  \ncjdelisle - (16:50): err SaveAction  \ntmortagne - (16:50): nop  \ncjdelisle - (16:50): It \"works\" but is unnecessary (AFAIK) because the next thing is the document is cloned.  \ncjdelisle - (16:53): r9204, yours. Looks like it's nolonger needed because the clone was added in r10418  \ntmortagne - (16:54): ok  \ncjdelisle - (16:55): I'll leave that one since we are on M2 now.  \nlucaa1 left at 16:59 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \nvenkatesh joined #xwiki at 17:01  \nlpereira left at 17:02 (Quit: Leaving.  \narkub left at 17:03 (Quit: Leaving  \narkub joined #xwiki at 17:08  \nlucaa1 joined #xwiki at 17:09  \nevalica1 left at 17:32 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \ncjdelisle - (18:10): darn \u00a0XWIKI-1538 is closed.
