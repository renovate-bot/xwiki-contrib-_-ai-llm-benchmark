However, seams like attachments are not exported with versions (history).  \n10:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0helge: how do you see that ?  \n10:17\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:20\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: click on the small version number next to the attachment. Original page shows a list of all versions of the attachment. Imported page shows only the latest version.  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0helge: would be great if you could create a jira issue with step to reproduce it  \n10:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*steps  \n10:32\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tmortagne: ok. sorry for being lazy. Another thing playing around with XE6M2  \n10:33\u00a0<helge>\u00a0after creating a subwiki I can not create anotherone. click on Add -> Wiki gets me a \"page does not exist\"  \n10:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you doing it from main wiki or subwiki (calling Add -> Wiki) ?  \n10:35\u00a0<helge>\u00a0tried both. no difference.  \n10:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds like a bug, it's in 6M2 right ?  \n10:35\u00a0<helge>\u00a0sorry, there was actually a difference. doing it from main wiki brings up a \"internal error\" message.  \n10:35\u00a0<helge>\u00a0yes, 6M2  \n10:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0a jira issue with your database/appserver etc would be nice again then  \n10:37\u00a0<helge>\u00a0shure. hopefully tonight. :) regards.  \n10:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(BTW if you test 6M2 on purpose it's great but note that this is a beta version)  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n10:40\u00a0<helge>\u00a0of course, no complains.
