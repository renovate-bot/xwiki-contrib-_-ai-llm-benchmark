After deserializing the object, the previous empty object withing is null, and thus I get a NPE. Any idea what is the strategy here ?  \n16:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0is the contained object also serializable?  \n16:24\u00a0<alokdrocks>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:25\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:25\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0ye, the serialization is successful. Even the deserialization is successful. But the object within the big object is now null.  \n16:26\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0it's like it doesn't been instantiated  \n16:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0but both objects implement Serializable, correct?  \n16:26\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes, all of them (that are involved in serialization process)  \n16:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm, that's supposed to work  \n16:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0idk read up on serialization, see if you can find code to examine the object in serialized state and good luck.  \n16:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0:)  \n16:29\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0it's a little bit odd.. because I get NPE when printing on screeh the things I need. and if the object is obtained directly (without serialization) it works. If I get the object from deserializing it, it doesn't  \n16:37\u00a0<kasun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:41\u00a0<kasunbg>\u00a0has quit  \n17:09\u00a0<alokdrocks>\u00a0has quit  \n17:11\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n17:27\u00a0<Chami2>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<drake01>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:03\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0oh, fyi I fixed the problem with maven getting bad data from github, it was Todd's problem but I found a workaround.  \n18:15\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle: ahh thats great  \n18:15\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0:)  \n18:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I also proved the first step is possible, I can generate groovy classes and persist them so user generated objects can be converted to groovy classes, compiled, optimized and stored.  \n18:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0just a fyi, go do something fun, it's Saturday!  \n18:19\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle: its 10pm over here i just came back from and its kind of new year seson here  \n18:20\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0\\*just came back from small trip  \n18:21\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0cool  \n18:21\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle:btw xwiki only got 3 slots right  \n18:21\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0:(  \n18:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I heard something like that.  \n18:23\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0thats very bad news  \n18:24\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0for me at least  \n18:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yea, can't know until the end.
