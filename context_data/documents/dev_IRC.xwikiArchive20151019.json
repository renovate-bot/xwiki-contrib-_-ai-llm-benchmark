So first you display the tree without the root parameter. You see what nodes there are in the tree. You choose a node. Depending on the entity type of that node and its reference you will compute the id that needs to be used to the root parameter  \n10:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if the node you selected is a document then the id needs to start with document:  \n10:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if the node is a space then space:  \n10:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if the node is a wiki, then wiki:  \n10:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in your case the tree displays nested documents, no spaces, so the root is a (nested) document  \n10:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so you must use an id like document: with the root parameter  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you keep saying \"in your case\"?  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0because the tree can displays nested documents, nested spaces, parent-child, etc. depending on the parameters that you pass  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in my wiki I have wikis, spaces and documents  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you have wikis and nested documents  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in 7.2+  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0which I believe you're using  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from a refererence POV I have wikis, spaces and documents  \n10:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0that's another thngs  \n10:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the tree displays nested documents with your current params  \n10:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so you need a document reference  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even when I use showSpaces=true?  \n10:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0obviously no, if you use showSpaces=true then the tree will show space nodes and thus you will have to use a space reference  \n10:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0showSpaces=true -> nested spaces  \n10:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0showSpaces=false -> nested documents  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok this didn't work either as I mentioned above  \n10:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0paste again the macro call  \n10:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the current version  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(note this is not what I want but I wanted to verify it works and see the result for my curiosity)  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0{{documentTree showTranslations=\"false\" showAttachments=\"false\" compact=\"true\" showSpaces=\"true\" root=\"space:$openToSpace\" showSpaces=\"true\" /}}  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(removed one showSpaces)  \n10:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0let me try  \n10:31\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why did you say that what I wrote is false at \"E.g.: wiki:xwiki,space:xwiki:Main, document:xwiki:Main.WebHome.

We would have to add also \"if you use a wiki then you must also specify showWikis=false\" and \"if you use a document then you must also specify showSpaces=false\". I think this is implied.  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the fact is that it fails completely if you don't do that and it's not specified anywhere  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can make the sentence generic  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think there's a design problem  \n10:50\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0IMO you first decide what kind of tree you want to display (nested documents, nested spaces, cross wiki, parent-child, etc.) and then if you want to choose a root, but you choose it after you see what types of nodes the tree has  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should be called documentTreeMacro but entityTreeMacro since it can display various entities  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we could have a documentTreeMacro for documents  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't agree that you have to use the macro before deciding how to pass parameters  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's so non logical  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nobody would ever do that  \n10:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I said \"you first decide what kind of tree you want to display\"  \n10:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0if you want nested documents, then why would you pass a space referece?  \n10:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very simple  \n10:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0or, if you want nested space then why would you pass a document reference  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because I want to display all documents under a given space  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0or, if you don't want wikis, why would you pass a wiki referecne  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it doesn't work like that  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes and that's the problem  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0see the showRoot parameter  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's impossible to understand how ti works  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it works different from any other existing macros  \n10:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the root needs to be \"suppoted\" by the current params  \n10:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the logic I mean)  \n10:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0\"to display all documents under a given space\" <--- what space  \n10:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we have nested documetns  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n10:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the user sees nested documents  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ND are \\*\\*only\\*\\* at the level of UI  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at the level of macros and API we have NS  \n10:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not ND  \n10:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the tree is about the UI  \n10:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0as a user I find it very confusing to use a macro where the params are not correlated with what I see on the UI  \n10:58\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I can see the user complaining \"the documentation says I need to specify a space but I don't see any space on the UI\"  \n10:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it more correct now?  \n10:59\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, looks good  \n11:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so back to my use case, I want to display siblings of the currnet doc.
