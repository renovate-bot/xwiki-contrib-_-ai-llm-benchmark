We get a few sites signed like https://www.foafssl.org and all requests get bounced off of those sites.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:02): Advantage: It's easy for the sysops and the users.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:02): Disadvantage: After login, the connection drops back down to plain old http.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:03): (This is implemented now.)  \nbblfish - (17:04): yes, then long term, we find a solution so you don't need foafssl.org  \nbblfish - (17:05): (we know you don't in fact need it) it's just to find a solution to make it really easy not to need foafssl.org :-)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:06): 2. Everybody gets a signed key for their website. Dnssec will make this easier but we still have to jump through hoops for semi redundant encryption which uses a broken model (you can get any key with enough money).  \nbblfish - (17:07): ( ah sorry, you had not finsihed. For example https://openid4.me/simpleLogin.php does not use foafssl.org - you need a webid before trying it )  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:07): Note: dnssec will improve the \"any key with enough money\" problem but AFAIK we still have to trust some guy with a \"key to the internet\".  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:09): bblfish: Do you know if the Kaminsky bug is actually fixed with dnssec assuming a root key were to leak out?  \nbblfish - (17:09): yes, though I can imagine with time that guy being in the UN, or them finding a way to have N <10 top guys  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:10): Nah \u00a0it'll be George W Bush who holds the key.  \nheadache - (17:10): ahahahahaa  \nbblfish - (17:10): Interesting, I don't know what happens in that case.  \nbblfish - (17:10): It is also possible to make hardware that contains the key in wrote only mode  \nbblfish - (17:10): or even write once, never see again  \nbblfish - (17:11): s/wrote/write/  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:11): (Human nature means the worst people try to get the positions of highest trust.)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:12): Someone needs the key to delegate the root zones, add zones etc. It should be as secure as old dns even if the keys are leaked.  \nbblfish - (17:12): there is a long wikipedia article on it  \nbblfish - (17:12): I think it's hierarchical  \nbblfish - (17:12): They had a problem with the first version I think due to the issue you mention  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:13): Even with fancy keys, the routers should know that .org is not hosted out of a laptop in a coffee shop.  \nbblfish - (17:15): :D  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:15): Anyway foafssl... \u00a0\u00a0Option 2 is already implemented, that's how foafssl.org works.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:15): Option 3 is the clients download an addon and validate the servers using foaf.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:16): (Not implemented)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:16): But it's relatively easy to do.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:17): I like 3 a lot because it provides 2 levels of trust (You can't middleman because you don't have the client key and you can't middleman because you don't have the server key.)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:18): Another feature which is sadly missing from Firefox is storing of good keys.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:19): If I go to bank.com today, and I go to bank.com tomorrow and suddenly the key is different and is signed by some obscure CA nobody knows about, I want to know.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:19): Currently you would get no notice about such an event.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:19): The key is signed by a CA which is installed in Firefox, it \\_must\\_ be good.  \nheadache - (17:22): do you study these things a lot? :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:22): I sit and think about it.  \nheadache - (17:23): I'm in the first phase \"I sit\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:23): Back in the day I used to read textfiles from sites which would use ssl but didn't bother to get their keys signed.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:23): Nobody cared about security, they used ssl just to be cool.  \nnpm joined #xwiki at 17:24  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:24): The browser would always say \"this site isn't trusted\" and I always clicked ok and wasn't bothered anymore for the day.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:25): With the advent of Firefox3 they put this cop in your way who says \"You shal not pass!\"  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:26): If you're on firefox, you can see him here https://svn.xwiki.org  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:27): I suspect the CA lobby, after all what CA would like the idea of self signed keys?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:32): So short story is CA don't really protect us, they make website owners pay money and they make it a pain to look at websites which use https and don't pay them.  \nxenon751 joined #xwiki at 17:36  \nxenon75 left at 17:36 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nheadache - (17:44): On tuesday I'll have an interview with Andreas Prlic BioJava's project lead http://biojava.org/wiki/Google\\_Summer\\_of\\_Code  \nheadache - (17:44): some advices are welcome :)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (17:50): I'm not the one to ask, bioinformatics concerns me for the reason foaf concerns you :)  \nheadache - (17:53): CalebJamesDeLisl, bioinformatics is not my field but someone tell me that it's not a big deal  \nheadache - (17:53): general advices about interview  \nxenon75 joined #xwiki at 18:08  \nxenon751 left at 18:08 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:09): Ask lots of questions.
