 \n11:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0updating the 9.3 release note  \n11:39\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0tmortagne: done for XWIKI-14217  \n11:48\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0gdelhumeau: so i figured out what was wrong with it, apparently the code was checking if the elements were present in the page when adding the steps  \n11:48\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0and on the edit page not all the elements of the steps were present and it caused some steps to be skipped over when creating the tour object  \n11:49\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0the thing is, the code cant make those assumptions because if we have multipage it will not always be the case  \n11:52\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0back  \n11:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n11:52\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: to summarize it's not possible to use plugins during a migration and your migrator use AS plugin when in subwikis  \n11:53\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0hmm  \n11:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0ah indeed  \n11:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because of the configuration  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ye  \n11:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0because the migrator itself does not use the plugin  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n11:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's because of plugin.getActivityStreamPreference  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no Preferences actually not xwiki.cfg  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which is an issue since at that point you don't have access to wiki level Preferences  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the database is not ready  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess it was just optimization to avoid searching the database when not needed  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so the fix is probably to do as if the store was always local  \n11:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like I'm the next RM  \n12:14\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0tmortagne: you're right  \n12:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so shouldExecute() must return true always  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. remove shouldExecute  \n12:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0indeed :)  \n12:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you want to me to do it?  \n12:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sure  \n12:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I prefer you take the responsability ;)  \n12:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I see :)  \n12:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0well, at worse, it just find some empty tables  \n12:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's my understanding too  \n12:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so I don't see any cause of error :/  \n12:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so it's https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14225 ?  \n12:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n12:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0XWIKI-14227  \n12:29\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0is there any way i can get the document action from javascript in xwiki?  \n12:29\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0pbondoerffer: don't know how to do it but it's in the page metadata probably  \n12:29\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0we surely have a js api for it though  \n12:30\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0i looked in the docs but couldnt find it  \n12:30\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0for example I see in xwiki.jhs  \n12:30\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0for example I see in xwiki.jd  \n12:30\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0for example I see in xwiki.js  \n12:30\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0:)  \n12:30\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0XWiki.contextaction == \"view\"  \n12:30\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0in: if (XWiki.docsyntax != \"xwiki/1.0\" && XWiki.contextaction == \"view\" && XWiki.hasEdit && XWiki.widgets.ModalPopup) {  \n12:30\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0so seems that the XWiki js object has it  \n12:31\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0(lunch time, bbiab)  \n13:06\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0mflorea gdelhumeau: the change introduced here https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-tour/commit/32b4ca207a37110c95f16eaa27256c757eda70a0 breaks multipages, because not all the elements of all steps will always be present in all the pages  \n13:07\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0to fix this, id have to remove the if clause, but it would be a regression?  \n13:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I see. Now, there are two problems:  \n13:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(1) if you check the step presence before the tour starts then you don't support multipage tours  \n13:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(2) if you check the step presence when the user clicks Next, then you don't know how many steps there are in the tour (you can't show \"Step 2 of 5\" for instance)  \n13:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0we can't have both. But we need to be aware that multipage tours have this downside: you can't know in advance how many steps will actually be present  \n13:13\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0well the issue is that this if condition completely breaks a multipage tour because bootstrap tour expects all steps to always be there  \n13:13\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0so the moment you remove one from the tour object, its lost and doesnt know what to do and just doesnt show anything  \n13:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0now, this can happen on single page tours also, if you have dynamic steps. Imagine that some content is added on page when you click a button, without reloading the page. And you want to have a tour step for that content. Thus you can't check the step presence before the tour starts  \n13:14\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0that too  \n13:15\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so I agree we need to \\*move\\* the if. We need to keep it thou, but in a different place. We need to keep it because an use case may be to show additional steps for a particular group of users (for admins for instance)  \n13:16\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0what we could do is add dummy steps that dont have any actual contents. perhaps bootstrap tour will have its internal count?  \n13:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so the if should be done when you click Next. i.e. ideally, when the user clicks Next we need to find the next steps that is available, i.e. the next steps that has the target DOM element available  \n13:17\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0oh alright, that makes more sense actually. i think its doable with the api too, because it has hooks for onNext  \n13:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0s/next steps/next step  \n13:17\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0okay i know what to do now  \n13:17\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0thanks!  \n13:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yw  \n13:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0with this we basically skip steps whose target DOM element is missing  \n13:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but the skip happens when the Next button is clicked  \n13:37\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0creating 8.4.6 versions in jira...  \n13:38\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0done  \n13:56\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0has quit  \n14:02\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n14:02\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:11\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:30\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0has quit  \n15:04\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_5>\u00a0has quit  \n15:35\u00a0<faichelbaum>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:14\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:15\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:23\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:37\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has quit  \n16:40\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:41\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:47\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:47\u00a0<sorinello>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:59\u00a0<ClmentAubin[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<aloisdg[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<KrzysztofPachno[>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<SotoX3[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<bele[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<evalica[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<TheBigfoot[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<LudovicDubost[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<jeremycahill[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n16:59\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:08\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:08\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0I'm sure they're working on it as we speak  \n17:08\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0FYI the irc bridge is out for the moment because matrix just got K-lined  \n17:09\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0aaand we're back  \n17:09\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:09\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0indeed we don't see your message on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/xwikiArchive20170425  \n17:09\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0hmm  \n17:09\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ah yes )  \n17:09\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0ah yes :)  \n17:10\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0seeing myself on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/xwikiArchive20170425 !  \n17:10\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a09 minutes of downtime, whatever, matrix is a good project and I support them  \n17:10\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0@cjd: you're not logged there though  \n17:10\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0forget that  \n17:10\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0just misread  \n17:10\u00a0<cjd[m]>\u00a0I am in #cryptpad in my oldschool IRC client  \n17:11\u00a0<VincentMassol[m]>\u00a0some ordering issue of messages  \n17:12\u00a0<amacsween[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:13\u00a0<evalica[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:21\u00a0<ClmentAubin[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<pbondoer[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<TheBigfoot[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<M-cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<SotoX3[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<KrzysztofPachno[>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<free4murad[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:35\u00a0<aloisdg[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:44\u00a0<pbondoerffer[m]>\u00a0mflorea gdelhumeau: could you review my pull-request?
