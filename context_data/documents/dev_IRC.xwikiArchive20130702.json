If I'm going to use the \"locales\" Solr filter behind the scenes, then the user will get a \"Locale\" facet when searching for all languages, thus there will be an inconsistency with the \"Language\" from the advanced options. I could display the face name as \"Language\" but I'm not what's best.  \n15:06\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne, vmassol: wdyt?  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0we need to choose one that's for sure  \n15:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0Locale is more technical than Language  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but that's a question for native English speaker if it's OK to call language \"fr\\_FR\"  \n15:08\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but using Language when in fact it's a locale is not that good either  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from Java point of view language is just the \"fr\" part  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I agree Locale that you don't see Locale a lot in UIs  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/agree Locale/agree/  \n15:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0another thing is that I get the list of languages to display in the Language filter from XWikiPreferences, and in the administration the list is called \"Supported Languages\"  \n15:09\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I guess I'll display Language for now, and use locale behind the schenes  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0all old stuff are called languages basically  \n15:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n15:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now I don't know if there is any alternative in \"basic user vocabulary\"  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Locale is too tech  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Language is much better from a user pov  \n15:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0true  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0If you need to represent fr\\_FR it should be 2 fields for a user: Country and Language  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not easy to represent as the name of a list of choices  \n15:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'm not going that far right now. I was just wondering about the \"Language\" advanced filter  \n15:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n15:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0and the \"Locale\" facet name  \n15:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0display name  \n15:18\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:20\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0guys, re SOLR indexing speed, HSQLDB should be the fastest, right ?  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not so sure  \n15:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's all in memory but that does not mean it has to be the best just because of that  \n15:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0because I am still experiencing slowness ... 10 minutes for 5000 entries. but msmeria is not able to reproduce, so this one is clearly a problem with my computer  \n15:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it's much faster than before. but still slow on my machine :)  \n15:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: did you tried to change the configuration ?  \n15:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0puttin larger number is faster, yes  \n15:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0but it defeats the purpose if the default values don't work for me  \n15:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0my idea is to test with the out of the box config  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: this is just configuration, it can't work perfectly for everyone  \n15:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am investigating further. gonna try with an jetty +hsqldb XE  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you have a lot of memory you use a bigger batch, if you don't have a lot of memory you use a smaller one etc  \n15:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am angry because I can't narrow down the issue  \n15:33\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no such thing as perfect default here  \n15:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I have an 8 GB RAM + QUad Core CPU  \n15:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0it shouldn't be slow at all  \n15:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless you drive is slow because you have other things using it  \n15:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0keep in mind that only one thing can use a drive at once, you have have the most powerful computer that it would still be slow if you have several things writing at the same time on your disk  \n15:36\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, this is why I am blaiming my HDD> I have mysql + postgres running as daemons, but those shouldn't use HDD unless I use the db  \n15:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: I don't think you really have to worry for 10 minutes  \n15:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0on msmeria laptop finishes in 1 minute, and he has even a lower config than me  \n15:38\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0\\*msmeria's  \n16:38\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n16:48\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:52\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:32\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n17:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:41\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n17:59\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:00\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n18:21\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n18:22\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:30\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:32\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:44\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:49\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0guys, I may have screwed up.
