 \n16:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes you don't need more  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0another possibility is to use the one provided by your linux distro repositories  \n16:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0on Debian based distribution it's libmysql-java package  \n16:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and the jar end up in /usr/share/java/mysql.jar  \n16:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but if you are on Debian (or Ubuntu) you should probably use XWiki Debian packages  \n16:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0makes things much easier  \n16:47\u00a0<Guest91715>\u00a0I'm ubuntu  \n16:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can look at http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationViaAPT for more details about Debian packages  \n16:48\u00a0<Guest91715>\u00a0I'm using puppet to install this  \n16:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n16:48\u00a0<Guest91715>\u00a0when I tried it on the same server it worked in a flash  \n16:49\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0tmortagne http://imgur.com/ejT0zAe  \n16:49\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/ezuB7aE3  \n16:49\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0perms are 755  \n16:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0boubou: what is import is what runs Tomcat, try \"ps aux | grep tomcat\"  \n16:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the issue is not related to the version of Java then you will need to produce more information than \"it doesnt look to work\"  \n16:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/produce/provide/  \n16:50\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0ps aux | grep tomcat  \n16:50\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0root \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02208 \u00a00.0 \u00a00.0 112636 \u00a0\u00a0984 pts/0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0S+ \u00a0\u00a010:50 \u00a0\u00a00:00 grep --color=auto tomcat  \n16:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you get with \"java --version\"  \n16:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0?
