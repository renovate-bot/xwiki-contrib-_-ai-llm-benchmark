If possible can anyone assist with an issue with xwiki 5.2.1 enterprise. In IE9 trying to start the wysiwyg editor on a section results in browser not responding.  \n11:51\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0im trying to find similar issues in jira but so far without luck. Additionally I tried turning on javascript notification errors, but that doesn't help. The browser still hangs and no notifications are shown.  \n11:53\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0the problem does not occur in Chrome (using v36)  \n11:55\u00a0<martin77\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:55\u00a0<martin77\\_>\u00a0closed my browser accidentally  \n11:56\u00a0<martin77\\_>\u00a0if anyone replied please repeat  \n11:57\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0has quit  \n11:57\u00a0<martin77\\_>\u00a0is now known as <martin77>  \n11:59\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n12:05\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0martin77: there is this issue http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10661 not sure if it's similar  \n12:07\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0martin77: please tell me if it's the same issue. You are testing with Colibri skin on a 5.2.1?  \n12:09\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0can you help me determine the skin  \n12:09\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0if thats what you're asking  \n12:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0does it look like this http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Colibri+Skin or like this http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Flamingo+Skin ? :)  \n12:10\u00a0<rihbyne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0anyway \u2026 it's surely on Colibri since Flamingo didn't existed in 5.2.1 - sorry  \n12:13\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0yes it looks closely to colibri  \n12:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0martin77: it might be the issue I linked you. It's marked as a blocker, but it's listed as Flamingo only issue. Blocker issues are fixed in high priority, so it might get fixed in 6.2.x. The only problem is the community position regarding supporting IE9 (since it's an older browser). We are still discussing it. So not sure how to help you, except waiting for the fix (if indeed is the same problem described there).  \n12:17\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0i see, just to let you guys know that because of technical reasons with IE11 and it using a database to store cookies, we're currently unable to move to IE11 in production  \n12:18\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0so we're sort of caught in between :\\  \n12:19\u00a0<martin77>\u00a0and upgrading might be ok, but I'd rather sell my manager that we can confirm this problem to be fixed in the 6.x version  \n12:21\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n12:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0martin77: did you reported the IE11 issue with the database?
