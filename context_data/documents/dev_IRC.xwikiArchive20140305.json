Where or what is the \"navigation treeview\" ?  \n12:02\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0and / or ... is it easy to integrate a \"treeview\" of pages, and a link like \"add sub page\". My users will need that.  \n12:02\u00a0<Yam`>\u00a0I created an application with structuredinputs to reference projects (client, description, who worked on it, what technologies used...) and I want to sort these with arrays such as an array project/dev, an array project/techno etc. Is there something to do that in xwiki ?  \n12:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Emenems: link please?  \n12:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(must be outdated we used to have a Navigation panel)  \n12:05\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0vmassol, http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/GettingStarted/XWikiEnterpriseBasicConcepts  \n12:05\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0vmassol, ok , if it's outdated, so i will dig into integration of a treeview :)  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are some options already  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should search on extensions.xwiki.org  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have a look at:  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0!search Menu Application  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(come on bot, don't fail on me!)  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0check the first link  \n12:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(Menu Application)  \n12:10\u00a0<sbaloul2>\u00a0but you have to be logged  \n12:11\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0oh  \n12:11\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a01. nice bot :-)  \n12:11\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:12\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a02. vmassol ok, i see. interesting, but i was thinking about a tree of user created pages. More like the idea from sbaloul2 , but in a side panel.  \n12:12\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a03. i found some \"Document Tree Plugin\"  \n12:12\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0I just need to understand that :)  \n12:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Yam`: most applications get a livetable of all entries of the application \"autmatically created\" \u00a0with them, does you have one, too ?  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Emenems: the initial implementation we had was called Navigation Panel  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually it's still bundled in XE  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not active by default  \n12:14\u00a0<Yam`>\u00a0ClemensR, I don't know, what are the applications \"automatically created\"?  \n12:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we stopped putting it on by default because it doesn't scale with the # of pages  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to scale you need something that loads page names dynamically when you expand a node  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like our treeview on AllDocs page  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case this is something we need to work on to provide a nice default navigation panel by default  \n12:15\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Yam`: \u00a0via AppWithMinutes, I mean, thats pretty automatically for me :)  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're missing this and everyone seem to want on  \n12:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*one  \n12:17\u00a0<Yam`>\u00a0ClemensR, I can add columns to a table but it's linear, there isn't the possibility to mix the column from all rows  \n12:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I just meant as the starting point  \n12:18\u00a0<Yam`>\u00a0Another question before that, how can I setup a database list ?  \n12:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I understood you wanted to have one table for every department, or so  \n12:20\u00a0<Yam`>\u00a0brb in ~10 minutes  \n12:22\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0vmassol, i have around 20 wikis up and running for 20 projects with students/people working in companies/people working in administration/etc. All communities NEED a Navigation Panel, otherwise they are literally LOST in a wiki. That's why i'm digging, because i would like to migrate all 20 (or more) to a new platform :-)  \n12:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I had some navigation panel lying around for a similar purpose, but it ended as a mess with 400 lines of code, and it still does not scale well  \n12:24\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0vmassol, ClemensR as a quick start, you said that \"navigation panel\" is still bundled, so i can at least try it in a new install ? what would be the \"limit\" of pages in your opinion ?  \n12:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes it is there, you can find it in the panel wizard  \n12:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0limit: about 500 maybe, for me  \n12:25\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0(i'm sorry, i'm like facing an emergency, i should set up a wiki for a demonstration before tomorrow :p )  \n12:26\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0ClemensR, great. It's enough for me. I can dig that later.  \n12:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it is in the Wiki Admin, look for \"Look &Feel\" > Panel Wizard  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Emenems: I'm not sure a generic nav panel is good  \n12:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0in the panel wizard open the \"Navigation\" section and drag and drop the \"Navigation\" panel to the left (or right) panel row  \n12:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0for a demo it is hopefully sufficient  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but a panel wheere you put the most important links is a good thing  \n12:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that's the Menu Application  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(used as a panel)  \n12:28\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0vmassol, but the menu app is static, right ?  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's why it's good  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0generic never leads to good nav  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would require AI for that :)  \n12:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for nav we already have the Index page  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/nav/generic nav  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the goto page feature  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ctrlg)  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ctrl+g  \n12:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and search suggest)  \n12:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and space index  \n12:31\u00a0<sbaloul2>\u00a0There is a panel to display all documents of current space, maybe that helps too  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/SpaceIndex+Macro can be used in a panel easily too but it won't scale to a large # of docs in a space  \n12:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it has a defalut count of 100)  \n12:32\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0hum.. do you suggest to use \"space\" to \"classify\" ? like i could end with 20 ormore spaces...  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh yes spaces are a good way to categorize  \n12:33\u00a0<Yam`>\u00a0back  \n12:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if the projects are completely different with different people, subwikis are the altrernative  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Emenems: what you'd like is http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/AllDocs?view=tree in a panel right?  \n12:33\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0Well .. yes, there WILL be a lot of instances of wikis  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Emenems: http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/AllDocs?view=tree  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Emenems: it obeys the parent relationship between pages  \n12:34\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0vmassol, ah yes, the view=tree but in a panel (if i understand, this is the name of the right column)  \n12:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Enemens: imo 20 is not much, but of course your mileage might vary  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Emenems: panels can be on left, right or both :)  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(but yes it's what you display in the side columns)  \n12:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0out Denis here had this tree view in a panel, but it permanently run out of space and into the content  \n12:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0s/out/our/  \n12:36\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0yeah ok  \n12:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0some \"small css problem\" that we have not figured out how to fix after a few hours of debugging  \n12:38\u00a0<Emenems>\u00a0Ok guys, I think i need a sandwich and some thinking about that.
