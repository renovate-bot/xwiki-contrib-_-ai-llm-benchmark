I'm curious to know what you think about it though  \n12:26\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hi vmassol \u00a0quite ok, but busy. \u00a0\u00a0how are you?  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fine, busy as always but that's good :)  \n12:27\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, should catch up with reading mailing list ... I am somewhat filtering by bug reports currently ;)  \n12:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0first reading: I am somewhat worried that xwiki-enterprise (the default distro) \u00a0either will have dependencies into xwiki-contrib, or it will be nearly empty ...  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no dep on xwiki-contrib  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0compared to XE the blog app will be removed by default  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should also check the thread about the demo flavor  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also note that this proposal is for xwiki github org, we can definitely have flavors in contrib if we wish  \n12:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(hence the demo flavor I'm proposing for example)  \n12:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you should also check the mail I've just sent about a list of extensions to move out of platform  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the general idea is:  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki core dev team focuses on core  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0leaving it to the community (xwiki-contrib) to create vertical apps and flavors  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0community AND colpanies  \n12:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*companies  \n12:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, yes, \u00a0it might confuse users that download a \"plain\" \u00a0xwiki, and find no \"vertical\" apps. Maybe the vanilla distro needs a hint on the welcome page to e.x.o ;)  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no such thing  \n12:35\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0just as an idea  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as downloaidng a plain wiki  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the first screen asks the user to choose the flavor  \n12:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(after they install xwiki)  \n12:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, but there is http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Download \u00a0where 90% of first time users will get xwiki from  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not a flavor  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the xwiki runtile  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0runtile  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0grr  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*runtime  \n12:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, I should really read the mails first ...  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and enterprise will go away  \n12:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just platform will remain  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically transforming the old hardcoded concept of enteprrise into flavors  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0providing 2 to start with: a base one, and a demo one, and waiting for the community to create a lot more  \n12:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I know that XWiki SAS is working on a XCS one for example too  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the base one, whatever name we choose for it, will be very similar to XE, it'll not have the blog app yb default)  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree with you about getting started with a base one  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why the idea is also to get the Tour app in platform  \n12:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0then the distribution wizard will indirectly have the \"dependencies\" by referencing to the flavours then  \n12:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and offer tours for new users  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the DW has runtime deps on e.x.o yes  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as it has now)  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we could point to e.x.o in the tour to explain to users that they can install extensions  \n12:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(+ explain the UI ofc)  \n12:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I am not sure if the DW currently proposed the most recent version of an extension, or the most recent compatible with platform ... will have to check that  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(lunch time, bb in 30mn)  \n12:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ok, bonne appetite  \n12:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thx  \n12:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0aside of that less apps inside core/platform certainly makes sense, even if some fall by the wayside then due to lack of maintenance ...  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, the main idea is to increase contributions to them  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since being in contrib makes them more easy to update for contributors  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in addition the platform is becoming too large for just the few xwiki core devs to handle  \n12:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(back to lunch)  \n13:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n13:14\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0back ClemensR  \n13:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I commented above btw, if you missed it ;))  \n13:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, I have seen it. I got distracted while figuring there is a multi-language blog variant ...  \n13:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n13:44\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:13\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:15\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:18\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n14:26\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw WDYT about filtering the \"Updated Watchlist\" messages from xwiki.org?  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in the irxbot)  \n16:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n16:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0can these watchlist updates be distinguished from other updates reliably? (Not that someone writes a spambot for XWiki which uses \"Updated WatchList\" as change comment for every edit :D )  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it can be distringuished by the comment + the fact that the change is in the XWiki space  \n17:36\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n17:38\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, that is probably pragmatic enough, no bot is likely to spam the XWiki space ...  \n17:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0except for creating user profile of course, e.g. http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/NissanIndonesia  \n17:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:25\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:28\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:32\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n19:43\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:44\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n21:43\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n22:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:44\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:51\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n23:52\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
