I have also started integrating it into actuall XWiki Source code.  \ndward - (23/06/2008 19:15): Great!  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:15): David : probably will come up with some version by the end of this week  \ndward - (23/06/2008 19:15): I look forward to it.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:16): As informed earlier I am using RemoteSearchable class in lucene to acheive this.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:18): Each machine (slaves) makes its index available to the master machine on some port.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:19): And Master Node searches all those remote indexes parallelly   \ndward - (23/06/2008 19:19): Sounds good.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:20): all configuration related should be set in xwiki.cfg -- right ?? like which port to run on, whether the particular machine is slave or master, such info..  \ndward - (23/06/2008 19:21): Yes.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:21): ok  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:24): Right now I planning a design to intergate remote search to the existing xwiki lucene plugin. Once the desinging is done, it should be the matter of days to integrate in into XWiki, since most of the background has been done.  \ndward - (23/06/2008 19:25): Okay.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:26): I will mail the design to you and dev list tomorrow, hope I will get some feedback :)  \ndward - (23/06/2008 19:26): I'll watch for it.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:26): ok   \ndward - (23/06/2008 19:28): You might want to update http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/DistributedXWikiSearchEngine as well.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:31): yeah I will  \ndward - (23/06/2008 19:31): Thanks.  \nSaiKrishna - (23/06/2008 19:31): :)  \nsdumitriu - (23/06/2008 20:46): news  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:46): Last 5 pages modified:  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:46): \u00a0\u00a0\\* IRC.xwikiArchive20080623 - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/xwikiArchive20080623, by XWiki.XWikiGuest  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:46): \u00a0\u00a0\\* FAQ.SpaceAdmins - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/SpaceAdmins, by XWiki.MikhaelSantos  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:46): \u00a0\u00a0\\* XWiki.scottmcg - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/scottmcg, by XWiki.scottmcg (Created user)  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:46): \u00a0\u00a0\\* AdminGuide.Authentication - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication, by xwiki:XWiki.JasperSiepkes  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:46): \u00a0\u00a0\\* AdminGuide.InstallationJBoss - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationJBoss, by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Added comment)  \nsdumitriu - (23/06/2008 20:47): news  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:47): Last 5 pages modified:  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:47): \u00a0\u00a0\\* IRC.xwikiArchive20080623 - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/xwikiArchive20080623, by XWiki.XWikiGuest  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:47): \u00a0\u00a0\\* FAQ.SpaceAdmins - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/SpaceAdmins, by XWiki.MikhaelSantos  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:47): \u00a0\u00a0\\* XWiki.scottmcg - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/scottmcg, by XWiki.scottmcg (Created user)  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:47): \u00a0\u00a0\\* AdminGuide.Authentication - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication, by xwiki:XWiki.JasperSiepkes  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 20:47): \u00a0\u00a0\\* AdminGuide.InstallationJBoss - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationJBoss, by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Added comment)  \nsdumitriu - (23/06/2008 21:31): news  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 21:31): Last 5 pages modified:  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 21:31): \u00a0\u00a0\\* IRC.xwikiArchive20080623 - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/IRC/xwikiArchive20080623, by XWiki.XWikiGuest  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 21:31): \u00a0\u00a0\\* FAQ.SpaceAdmins - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/SpaceAdmins, by XWiki.MikhaelSantos  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 21:31): \u00a0\u00a0\\* XWiki.scottmcg - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/scottmcg, by XWiki.scottmcg (Created user)  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 21:31): \u00a0\u00a0\\* AdminGuide.Authentication - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Authentication, by xwiki:XWiki.JasperSiepkes  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 21:31): \u00a0\u00a0\\* AdminGuide.InstallationJBoss - http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationJBoss, by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Added comment)  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 23:07): Main.ReleaseNotesWatch10RC1 was modified by XWiki.lucaa - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ReleaseNotesWatch10RC1  \nxwikibot - (23/06/2008 23:58): Applications.WatchApplication was modified by xwiki:XWiki.lucaa - http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Applications/WatchApplication  \n\n"}
