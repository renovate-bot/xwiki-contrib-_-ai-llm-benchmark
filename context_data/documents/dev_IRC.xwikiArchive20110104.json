It can change and it seems to be different for LibreOffice so the best is to use an API but I couldn't find that API  \n13:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ah, ok, let me do it  \n13:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0true enough. i was just trying to suggest a dirty hack which would allow to change it at least for OO.o installations... and if you figure out what it is for LibO, also for that one. still only very dirty hacking...  \n13:18\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0only other way i could imagine would be to provide a patch for OOo/LibO and hope they adapt it, given there really is no API at this time  \n13:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu1: seems like xpage=attachments isn't correct. For ex: http://myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Jeromewentzel?xpage=attachments  \n13:20\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0That's right  \n13:20\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0It should be viewer=attachments  \n13:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok...  \n13:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0jstoldt: maybe there is an API hidden somewhere. I'll asked them on the forum  \n13:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0okay, i just joined #documentfoundation and asked them about the dir and where the information got moved  \n13:22\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0will also inquire about the API  \n13:23\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0just asked both questions. let's see if we get reply  \n13:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0let me join the channel too  \n13:29\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:30\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:49\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:54\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0guys, I have some trouble with tests  \n13:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the moment I add xwiki-core as a dep to my macro, my tests fail with this error:  \n13:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0http://pastebin.com/HEqXHi5q  \n13:56\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0do you know what might cause it?  \n14:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: what is your test trying to do when you get this issue ?  \n14:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0wait, I will debug and let you know  \n14:05\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it's the dashboard test  \n14:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0the one and only  \n14:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: do I have a easy way to reproduce this ?  \n14:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0https://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-rendering/xwiki-rendering-macros/xwiki-rendering-macro-dashboard/src/test/java/org/xwiki/rendering/RenderingTests.java  \n14:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I think just adding the xwiki-core as a dep to the project  \n14:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0e.g. the dashboard  \n14:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0dashboard macro  \n14:06\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and then try to run it  \n14:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n14:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0will do  \n14:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0last time i had this issue was because I was playing with classloader but it's pretty specific to extension manager  \n14:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa: xwiki-core depends on dashboard macro already  \n14:12\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0mmh...  \n14:12\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I see  \n14:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maybe that's what makes maven classloader a bit lost  \n14:13\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but xwiki-core doesn't really depend on dashboard, it just needs to drag it in the distribution...  \n14:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure, xwiki-core is not the best example of clean maven project  \n14:14\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can move dashboard dependency from xwiki-core to web if you need to depends on core  \n14:14\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0lemme try that, and see what happens  \n14:15\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it's gonna be odd because all other macros are in the core  \n14:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sure but that's not the only solution, you could introduce a new component module for what needs to manipulate xwiki-core directly and use it in your macro like we usually do  \n14:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0that's what I do  \n14:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but I get the same issue  \n14:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I got it when I put the dep directly  \n14:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and then I put my code that manipulates core in another module and made macro depend on that module  \n14:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0and it does the same  \n14:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you need a api module and an implementation module otherwise it's useless  \n14:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0macro depends on api module to not transitively depends on xwiki-core  \n14:20\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ah right  \n14:20\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0but then it's a tiny little bit of overkill  \n14:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0depends of your use case  \n14:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I need skin extensions  \n14:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's just a matter of does this new module would make some sense for others  \n14:22\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0it surely makes a lot of sense for other situations as well  \n14:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0mmh. wait I have an idea...  \n14:23\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0ah no it's not gonna work :(  \n14:24\u00a0<venkatna>\u00a0has quit  \n14:24\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0so, I still think it's a bit of overkill to have 2 different modules for skinx wrapper, but we could actually implement the skinx API in the core itself  \n14:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n14:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0like we do for other things  \n14:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or the plugin  \n14:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since that's where this is really  \n14:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes, I was thinking about the plugin actually  \n14:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I still need sergiu  \n14:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sergiu's agreement for that  \n14:27\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sdumitriu1: ?  \n14:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it basically the same thing than starting to convert skinx from plugin to component concept  \n14:29\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0yes, I had written this wrapper already, for this very purpose, to provide components interface for the skinx  \n14:30\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0I sent it to sergiu and I am waiting for some response...  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice textual format: http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/  \n14:31\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n14:33\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0indeed, vmassol  \n14:36\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0is there something like #foreach($page in $xwiki.spaces.spacename) ?  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Menso: yes in ^xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0is now known as <sdumitriu>  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0public List<String> getSpaceDocsName(String SpaceName) throws XWikiException  \n14:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so $xwiki.getSpaceDocsName($space)  \n14:43\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n14:43\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0I'm using this now:  \n14:43\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0#foreach($page in $xwiki.getSpaceDocsName(GemAppTest))  \n14:43\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0\u00a0\\* [[$page]]  \n14:43\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0#end  \n14:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"GemAppTest\"  \n14:44\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0check  \n14:54\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:01\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0tmortagne, guys, I just sent a vote on the list for the implementation of skinx component API, as we've discussed on this channel with tmortagne  \n15:17\u00a0<+lucaa>\u00a0sdumitriu: please answer  \n15:18\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0K  \n15:31\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n15:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:45\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n16:09\u00a0<sabageru>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0Mmm, I can't seem to find the code anywhere anymore, how do I use velocity again to check if a page is being viewed or editted?  \n16:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0#if ($context.action == 'view')  \n16:12\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0I will ask this again, is there a particular reason for which setParameter is not in the Block interface but in the AbstractBlock implementation?  \n16:12\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0( vmassol, tmortagne )  \n16:12\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0thanks sdu  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa1: getParameter too apparently  \n16:14\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0yes, both parameters APIs  \n16:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0everything related to parameters  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can't think of a good reason  \n16:16\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd say it's an error  \n16:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0probably  \n16:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well or rather we didn't have a use case for it yet  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0+1 to make it part of the Block interface from me  \n16:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0both, if we had use case we would have seen it ;)  \n16:18\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0I think this is the third time I ask :D  \n16:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0lucaa1: don't remember that  \n16:19\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0so, I open an issue, does anybody else than me want to fix it  \n16:19\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0maybe I always picked christmas or some other holidays to ask about this  \n16:19\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0:)  \n16:19\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0because once was somewhere last week  \n16:20\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0no, it was a 24 dec  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nice timing  \n16:20\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0When I do something like this: [[Software Producten.$doc.display(\"OpenDir\\_SoftProd\")]] to make a link to a page it displays the pagename if \"OpenDir\\_SoftProd\" is empty  \n16:20\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0which is a bad day to ask that, I agree  \n16:20\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Menso: don't use display it generates HTML  \n16:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$doc.getValue(\"...\")  \n16:22\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0anyone else handling the Block thing, or I should do it?  \n16:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa1: go ahead  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I have too many local changes in the rendering module to handle it right now)  \n16:23\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0vmassol: issue remains  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Menso: you should test what you get  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0print it  \n16:23\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0vmassol: ok  \n16:26\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0getParameters, getParameter, setParameters, setParameter, right?  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n16:26\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0vmassol: the problem seems to be when I put it in a link  \n16:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa1: make sure you refactor the javadoc too  \n16:27\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0for example, see https://wiki.noiv.nl/xwiki/bin/view/GemAppTest/Haarlem  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to use {inheritdoc} and @see  \n16:27\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0yes, I'll handle that  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and change the @since tags  \n16:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n16:27\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0is there any xwiki.org documentation i need to update also? :P  \n16:27\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0I need to change since tags? for what? for the interface?  \n16:27\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0getValue and Display below 'Functies:' use $doc.display and $doc.getValue and both show nothing correctly, below that I put [[Space.$doc.getValue(\"somevalue\")]] and it shows the title of the page in the link instead of being empty  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0lucaa1: you're lucky this time, no, althoug there are always stuff to improve on xwiki.org ;)  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@since for the interface  \n16:28\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0hmm... that's how since works?  \n16:28\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0we change it when we change a function?  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n16:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're creating new apis  \n16:28\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0yes, yes  \n16:29\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0but we change @since tag when I do that?  \n16:29\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0what does since mean?  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can leave existing @since in AbstractBlock  \n16:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/can/should/  \n16:31\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0wait, we have since tags for each function  \n16:31\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0that's the since tag you mean, right? not the class since tag  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes method  \n16:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\* @since 1.7M2 for setParameters  \n16:32\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0yes, I will leave that in the impl  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0brb  \n16:37\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:42\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:42\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0sdumitriu, Pong  \n16:43\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Ping?  \n16:43\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0anyone any idea on my earlier question regarding links to empty values?  \n16:47\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0Menso: you make a link to  \n16:47\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0MySpace.$doc.display(\"something\")  \n16:47\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0so when $doc.display(\"something\") is empty, your link goes to  \n16:47\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0MySpace.  \n16:47\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0which means, resolved as a reference, the current page  \n16:47\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0what is the result that you expect?  \n16:50\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0That makes sense, I was hoping it would not show any link  \n16:50\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0now I need to check all the values if empty and if not display and otherwise not I suppose? :)  \n16:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You do write [[  \n16:50\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You get a link when you do that  \n16:51\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0yes, but I don't understand why it shows the page title of the current page  \n16:51\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0I think even [[]] displays a link, to current page as well  \n16:51\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0instead of showing nothing  \n16:51\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0Menso: you cannot have a link with an empty label  \n16:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The wiki syntax doesn't know XWiki internals, so it can't decide on its own \"ok, this is not a proper link, let's just forget this and go home\"  \n16:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You link to a document  \n16:51\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0because that's not a link anymore  \n16:51\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The document is always valid  \n16:51\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0there are some defaults  \n16:52\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0right, I was expecting it to be translated into <a href=\"foo\"></a>  \n16:52\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0You can't have a \"not a document\" document  \n16:52\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0Menso: that does not make sense  \n16:52\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0actually you might be able to force it if you put the label explicitely  \n16:52\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0because a link with only a reference and no label will have an automatically generated label, which is the name of the page it links to  \n16:52\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0so  \n16:53\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0lucaa1: see https://wiki.noiv.nl/xwiki/bin/view/GemAppTest/Haarlem everywhere it says 'Haarlem' now I want it to be empty since the value is null and only become a link if the value is not null  \n16:54\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0MySpace.  \n16:54\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0reference is resolved as a ref to current page, because that's how resolver works  \n16:54\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0and then the link label generator will generate the current page name as the label of that link  \n16:54\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0Menso: that's not correct: if you don't want links, there should be no links. having <a href=\"foo\"></a> when in fact you don't want a link is against the principles of HTML  \n16:54\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0which should also be \\_semantic\\_ not only visual  \n16:55\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0the information is in the markup as well, not only in what the user can read  \n16:55\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0so, if you don't want links when the value is empty, you'll have to do an if  \n16:55\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0#if(myValueIsNotEmpty)  \n16:55\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0\u00a0[[ ... ]]  \n16:55\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0#end  \n16:55\u00a0<Menso>\u00a022 times :D  \n16:56\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0I'll see if I can maybe make a function in velocity to do it  \n16:56\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0yes, you can write a velocity macro  \n17:03\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0am trimis vot numai ca am vb cu tmortagne pe lista despre asta  \n17:04\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0si vbisem si cu sergiu, si ma gandeam ca na, sa zica acolo toata lumea parerea pentru posteritate  \n17:04\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0insa...  \n17:04\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0cu tmortagne pe IRC, nu pe lista  \n17:04\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0sorry guys very wrong chat  \n17:04\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0:)  \n17:05\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0(it was bound to happen)  \n17:05\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0sooner or later :)  \n17:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0lol, i was actually wondering just now X-D  \n17:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0anyway, good bye  \n17:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0have a nice day  \n17:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n17:14\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:18\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n17:18\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0is now known as <npm>  \n17:19\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n17:25\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0using a velocimacro creates <span> stuff in html output which seems to have a rather disruptive effect on my table  \n17:33\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0e.g. code in the page:  \n17:33\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0|=CMS|$doc.getValue(\"CMS\\_Status\")|#createLink(\"Xwiki\" \"SoftProd\")|#createLink($doc.getValue(\"CMS\\_Supplier\") \"Supplier\")|$doc.getValue(\"CMS\\_Desc\")  \n17:34\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0output in HTML:  \n17:34\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0<tr><th scope=\"row\">CMS</th><td>ge&#239;mplementeerd</td><td><span class=\"wikicreatelink\"><a href=\"view-source:https://wiki.noiv.nl/xwiki/bin/create/Software%20Producten/Xwiki?parent=xwiki%3AGemAppTest.Haarlem\"><span class=\"wikigeneratedlinkcontent\">Xwiki</span></a></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"wikicreatelink\"><a href=\"view-source:https://wiki.noiv.nl/xwiki/bin/create/Leveranciers/Pietje%20Puk%20webdesign?parent=xwiki%3AGemAppTest.Haarlem\"><span class=\"  \n17:35\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0what's the problematic span?

 \n17:53\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0are we sure we want such a page on .org ?  \n17:53\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0sburjan`: there's a mail about it on the users list  \n17:53\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0I think we sorta agreed :)  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: I see value for the community to know strenghts and weaknesses of xwiki vs other solutions  \n17:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't you think so?  \n17:55\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0fixed typo  \n17:56\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: I agree to that, it's just that IMO competitors is a little harsh as a word to use.  \n17:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes we could replace with another word  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XWiki Alternatives, etc  \n17:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can propose one  \n17:58\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0yes, Alternative is the best I can think of. Competitors leaves the impression we want to crush those products and we see them as a threat. This is how I interpret it  \n18:02\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0It might turn potential xwiki customers to your competitors or 'alternatives'  \n18:03\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0yes, also true  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes but we shouldn't be afraid of this  \n18:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on the contrary  \n18:04\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0well this depends on personal perception how safe to we feel on the market  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if we're bad in a domain, hiding it is not going to help, instead we'll just need to improve on that domain, and making it visible will help us address it  \n18:05\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0I think it's very important to explain the difference.. the application I'm making for NOiV now I could never have made in Confluence for example  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes good explanation is key  \n18:06\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0But if you're not interested in that, Confluence might look a lot easier to use and people might move to that instead  \n18:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we want xwiki to be easier to use than confluence so we also need to know what we're lacking in this domain if that's the case  \n18:07\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0I've got XWiki and Confluence both deployed at customers, I think the big difference is in quality control atm  \n18:08\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0Menso: what do you mean ?  \n18:09\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0With new XWiki releases there's often also some new bugs in the system  \n18:09\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0A lot of the time those are quickly fixed in a new version but for the customer that means they need to upgrade to this new version again, etc  \n18:10\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I understand  \n18:10\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0With confluence, we never have this, you turn it on and can walk out the door  \n18:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Menso: one thing we're working on is to ease upgrades so at least this will mitigate the issue  \n18:11\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0Then again, with confluence, we can't build applications or customize it for customers, etc :)  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that it's much easier for confliuence  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since you can't modify base pages  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there's no merge to be done  \n18:11\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0vmassol: true, confluence upgrade is extract to /usr/local/confluence<version/, turn off old one, turn on new one, done  \n18:12\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0ah well, it's hard to compare, they are two different tools for different purposes I suppose  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n18:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also confluence is mostly for dev teams (even though it can be used by non dev teams)  \n18:17\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: I'm proposing \"Other Alternatives to XWiki\" instead of competitors or rivals  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: you could propose it to gregory  \n18:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or propose it on that page  \n18:18\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0or, proposing to G  \n18:20\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0sorry for missing the Thread on userlist and opening the discussion again  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or on the list indeed  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0best place  \n18:22\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0problem is that I got until 5 minutes ago the userlist on Digest mode... so I don't see the votes. I only see the mail Gregory send and the one you replied. No +1  \n18:24\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0but I will talk to G  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: ping  \n18:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we'll need to talk about how you'd like to handle transformations in the wysiwyg editor  \n18:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(knowing that a transformation can modify any block, and add blocks too)  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so for example you might need to have a changeset id to know that several modifications come from the same transformation  \n18:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, same as with macros. I need to detect them and make the output readonly  \n18:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well you also need to offer the ability to change the original text  \n18:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0you mean edit a transformation that isn't a macro?  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example imagine you have emoticon support  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0by using a drop down list of emoticons  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when the user clicks on an emoticon image it outputs for ex : )  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is transformed  \n18:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but the user needs to be able to edit it to change the emoticon  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(to : ( for ex)  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0macros or not macro, we need a generic support for all transformations I think  \n18:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and special handling for well-known transformations  \n18:31\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the difference is that macros have parameters  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with the changes I' m mkaing all tx are the same  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the origianl blocks are output and the HTML renderer will use the xml serialized to serailize them  \n18:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in this case you needs to make the macro markers usable for all transformations  \n18:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in a generic way  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are no longer macro markers  \n18:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0how do you mark a transformation in the HTML?  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I think we still need a transformation id  \n18:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the changeset id I was referring to  \n18:33\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0vmassol: confluence mostly for dev teams? I have succes with it mostly with companies without any technical people whatsoever :-)  \n18:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: you find it the same way that current macro markers  \n18:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but in a more generic format  \n18:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: (07:33:06 PM) vmassol: there are no longer macro markers  \n18:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that doe snot mean there is not marker  \n18:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that means the markers are more generic  \n18:34\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0what do you mean by \"changeset id\"?  \n18:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0instead of macro information you find transformation informations  \n18:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this changeset id is just an idea I've had (not discussed with tmortagne yet)  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I think you might need it  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0imagine a tx that replaces some blocks in some location and adds some others in other places in the XDOM  \n18:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0but why not using xml comments, just make the macro syntax more general  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll get markers for each change  \n18:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you need to know that it's part of the same tx  \n18:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sure, but that can be part of the marker syntax  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/need/might need/  \n18:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: that's the plan  \n18:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes the changeset id is going to be output in the marker syntax  \n18:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0again you will have a transformation marker  \n18:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i dn't know about this changeset id  \n18:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: for now what i see is that you will get a block marker instead of a macroblock marker basically  \n18:37\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0just a different syntax from which you can unserialize a Block  \n18:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so, as long as I can detect the transformation by looking at the HTML and I have the transformation source in the HTML then I can add generic support in the wysiwyg editor  \n18:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0like now you unserailize a macro block basically  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: it's more complex  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0again imagine a tx that does 2 things  \n18:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0replace some blocks + adds some other at the end of the doc  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you double click on the added blocks  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to find the original content  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is split  \n18:39\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: not really  \n18:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unless we repeat it for each marker  \n18:40\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it depends of the transformation  \n18:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: a transformation must have an \"insertion point\" i.e. the place where its source appears in the wiki syntax. This \"insertion point\" can be marked in the HTML and the rest of the \"sub\"-transformation markers must refer to this place using an id as you suggested  \n18:41\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the important part is that the WYSIWYG can know what content is generated  \n18:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then there is kind of transformations like macro it know how to handler is a specific way  \n18:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but for some other it will just be readonly content  \n18:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's a case by case basis i think  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: well the user should always be able to change the original content  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when you click on \"sub\" marker (as mflorea calls them) you still need to be able to find the original content to edit  \n18:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you can't do that in a generic way  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or each marker repeats the whole original content  \n18:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0every transformations are differents  \n18:44\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0sure, I'll find the marker for the insertion point and take the source from it  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: for me it's just about having a changeset id  \n18:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could use it this way in XDOM: block.startChangeset(String id), endChangeset(id)  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then when you add, replace, etc it saves the \"history\" with the changeset id  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when we output XHTML the id is used in the markers  \n18:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(haven't thought it through yet though still need some thinking)  \n18:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i don't see how the WYSIWYF is supposed to do with your id  \n18:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/how/what/  \n18:46\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex,show all parts modified by the same tx in the same color, allow to edit the same original text when you click on any marker with the same changeset it  \n18:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0when the editor find a transformation marker it can use the id to lookup the \"insertion point\" and take the source of the transformation. Basically the id is useful only for editing the transformation  \n18:48\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0well, yes, for styling too  \n18:51\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0guys, I have to go  \n18:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: yep me too, let's continue tomorrow  \n18:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:59\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: email sent to users  \n18:59\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0reply  \n19:18\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0is there an easy way to 'clone' properties from a class, in case a user wants to set two different values to it?  \n19:19\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0for example property cms\\_product should be 'joomla' and cms\\_status 'phased out' while another cms\\_product should be 'xwiki' and cms\\_status be 'implemented'  \n19:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:26\u00a0<Menso>\u00a0I could use multiple select to solve issue of selecting multiple options but then the status would be unclear for each of the selected options  \n19:45\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:55\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0guys, I want to commit XE-787  \n19:55\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0should I commit it on 2.7 as well?  \n19:57\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0+1  \n19:59\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0sdumitriu: could you vote on the userlist regarding : [xwiki-users] [request] Comparing XWiki to other solutions  \n19:59\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's not a vote  \n20:00\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0but I proposed something on that thread ...  \n20:00\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0didn't wanted to start a new thread  \n20:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0K  \n20:03\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n20:04\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0ah wait  \n20:04\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0it's not XE  \n20:04\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0it's XAADMINISTRATIO  \n20:04\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0N  \n20:10\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0what's the diff between XE/Administration and XAADMINISTRATION ?  \n20:11\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0I have no clue... I would say the the XE/Administration is a left over  \n20:11\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0from the time XAADMINISTRATION was not a standalone app, but part of the XE  \n20:12\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0but now it's part of XE, right ?  \n20:12\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0no, it's an independent application, which is bundled in XE  \n20:12\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0but for example, on a clean platform (the installed war) with no pages, you can decide to install only the administration application  \n20:13\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0this was my next question. But I guess installing Admin App doesnt install the actual appz, right ?  \n20:13\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0what appz?  \n20:13\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0the sources are here: https://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/xwiki-applications/trunk/administration/ it has its own release cycle, etc  \n20:13\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0example : invitation, Import/Export, OpenOffice Server, etc  \n20:14\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0Import/Export is part of the administration application  \n20:14\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0openoffice server is not an application, is just a configuration section  \n20:14\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0which I don't remember if it comes by def with admin app or not  \n20:15\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0no, it seems it's not  \n20:16\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0so XE is pretty complex as a XAR. a lot of bundled stuff within it  \n20:16\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0yes, there are very little things which are \"pure XE\" if you wanna call it like that.
