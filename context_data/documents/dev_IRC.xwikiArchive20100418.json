It's intriguing, it removes some of the bad ideas like using reflection to violate OOP but it also blocks the finally clause which makes it hard to implement.  \ngvallarelli joined #xwiki at 10:46  \ngvallarelli - (10:46): Hi  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 11:19  \njvelo left at 11:42 (Quit: Ex-Chat  \nvmassol left at 12:37 (Quit: Leaving.  \nnickless joined #xwiki at 13:39  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (14:43): Here's a wild idea.
