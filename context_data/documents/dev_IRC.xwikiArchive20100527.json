Only the last revisions in the package gets imported  \njvelociter - (18:15): while in branch 2.3, the test pass (= all revisions gets imported)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:17): Let me look when it started. I can't remember fooling around in the versioning store.  \njvelociter - (18:18): I've started debugging and the diffs between 2.3 and 2.4 I see would be in that area (versionning store).  \njvelociter - (18:18): there is http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-4265  \njvelociter - (18:18): and http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-5098 too (which is not in versionning store, but could be linked as well)  \nevalica left at 18:18 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (18:19): Ahh, yes getPreviousVersion.  \njvelociter - (18:19): I don't have time to investigate further tonight, got to go in 10 min.
