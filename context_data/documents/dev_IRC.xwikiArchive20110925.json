None is exactly right  \n21:17\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0The core of the interface is getType, getEntityReference, isDeleted, but there's also addDataToLuceneDocument which invalidates the \"reference\" name  \n21:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry sdumitriu watching a movie with wife right now\u2026 it's the ads right now but the movie will start again shortly\u2026 ;)  \n21:46\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0No problem  \n22:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok bed time here\u2026. just rebuilt XE and tried calling a few pages. I find the wiki very slow compared to before. Hope it's just an impression.  \n23:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:16\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
