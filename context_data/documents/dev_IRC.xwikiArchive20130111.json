Would you know? Maybe it would be good to have manuel test it (that would make it learn about developing apps too). I also think we should mention that there's now another way of doing it with AWM and link to the FAQ app on e.x.o, wdyt?  \n08:54\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm diff seems broken in 4.3  \n08:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/Notifications?viewer=changes&rev1=25.3&rev2=26.5  \n08:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and all he did was https://www.evernote.com/shard/s119/sh/f5a5368d-06d8-4ad2-b9ef-37817dc8a2b5/a9107f62f8d3aff3ed46d1b636f82646  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I\"ve tried to reproduce locally but I cannot, so I guess it may have been fixed  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne/mflorea: any idea? (since I think you worked on the diff since 4.3)  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the first version where we refactored the history is broken (missing jar in the WAR) not sure which version it was  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n09:07\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I haven't worked on the UI since 4.3. tmortagne did some fixes though since then  \n09:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0fixes on the \"backend\"  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep but I don't remember fixing a totaly broken history :)  \n09:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess the first version of the new history is older than 4.3 so it's probably something else  \n09:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe there is a bug still existing specific to something on xwiki.org  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just created this one too: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-326  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which is different  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you are sure there is not all theses changes between 25.3 and 26.5 ?  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's improvement, not bug)  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is several version between them  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yep I hecked  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not just one change given the versions  \n09:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: you get the same on github..I don't understand what you expect  \n09:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0re XCOMMONS-326  \n09:11\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0changes are grouped  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: something like we had before  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now it's unusuble  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I had to spend mmore than 30 seconds looking at it 5 times  \n09:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: are you talking about UI or algo in XCOMMONS-326 ?  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to see what was changed  \n09:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not very clear  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: just answering mflorea now  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: indeed I put the wrong versions in my link above  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah i know why  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you don't show minor edits  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then you see 25.3 and then 26.5  \n09:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it takes last minor of each major version it seems  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep apparently  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's ok  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only problem is just the one I reported  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the line diff grnaularity  \n09:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so in your example you want to highligh the end of each line basicaly ?  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or closer  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I remember trying some framework on google code  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you could adjust the precision  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it shouldn't be at char level ofc  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but word level is probably better  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://neil.fraser.name/software/diff\\_match\\_patch/svn/trunk/demos/demo\\_diff.html  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: wasn't the UI supposed to add a char level diff to the base line level diff ?  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that's hte one I played with)  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0try efficiency cleanup, 4  \n09:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe it was just the first version  \n09:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, it does that, but only when there 1/1 line change. When you replace N line with M lines you cannot do this  \n09:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0efficiency cleanup 1 would be too much for ex  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we need different diff views  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0with a button for the user to switch  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we need side by side diff  \n09:19\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: in this case there is the same number of lines on this specific modification, we could maybe still reuse char level diff in this case just to highligh with a different color or something  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as ide do)  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0side by side as ide do would be awesome and probably the best for users, but harder to do  \n09:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: N=M doesn't mean that each line from N matches the correponding lines from M  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0semantic cleanup sounds really the best in the link I gave  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it adapts automaitcally  \n09:20\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0what vmassol has is a very specific use case  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to make something the most readable  \n09:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: try the semantinc cleanup and change the content to see the result  \n09:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: sure but I'm talking about when inside the line based diff do a diff when you have the same ids and number of lines in the diff element  \n09:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not that specific  \n09:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: the diff tells me just that 4 lines have been replaced with 4 lines. There's nothing to tell me that each line from - matches the lines from +  \n09:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: but it's enough IMO, if you have the same number of line you could highligh with a different color the difference line by line  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm not talking about changing anything to the -/+ display  \n09:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I could yes  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that's what Eclipse does for example  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying to find something that's tehnically not too hard and improve a bit the display  \n09:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: I can do what the same as for 1/1 change, but it's not going to be semantically correct always  \n09:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw the watchlist does a nice job  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for the diff)  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's readable in there  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://www.evernote.com/shard/s119/sh/f5a5368d-06d8-4ad2-b9ef-37817dc8a2b5/a9107f62f8d3aff3ed46d1b636f82646  \n09:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's the old history diff AFAIK  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, from a user POV it's strange to see different diff algos  \n09:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ie a char based diff  \n09:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0well we need to update the watchlist with new diff that's all  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I look at watchlist diffs every day and they're pretty good  \n09:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not exactly a choice  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well I hope we improve the diff first  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since otherwise it's going to be impossible to read  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you have 50 change to read every day  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you want it to be clear  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and fast  \n09:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the same diff cn't be both unreadable (which is why we have the new one) and perfect...  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(don't understand this sentence :))  \n09:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0again the watchlist use the old diff  \n09:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which was unusable acording to everyone in the old history  \n09:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0old diff is ok when you have very few changes  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0link=?  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0link?  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because the new one is a lot more unreadable for me  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and i don't ermember any discussion about the readability of the diff and the choice  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I rememebr a tech choice only  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw just seen that we still have a lof of open translations issues in 4.x: http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/TestReports/TranslationsReport43  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: the jira issues are wrong it seems  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(check the first 3)  \n09:55\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Functional%20Tests/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/org.xwiki.enterprise$xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/1929/testReport/junit/org.xwiki.test.ui.administration/UserProfileTest/testChangePasswordWithoutEnteringPasswords/  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"org.openqa.selenium.ElementNotVisibleException: Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I\"m going to work on fixing jenkins email sending today  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now when a build passes but tests fail, no emails ar sent!  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*are  \n10:01\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0it's old.
