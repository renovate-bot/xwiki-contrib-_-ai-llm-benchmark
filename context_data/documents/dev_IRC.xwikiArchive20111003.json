Is it causing any?  \n11:55\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it is not the case to create a new product since the main wiki is the same standard XE/XEM  \n11:56\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it's only the generated application artefacts (workspaces/subwikis) that are altered  \n11:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0first of all, platform shouldn't know there is an enterprise package. then, CI builds platform and enterprise continuously because platform triggers enterprise and not enterprise triggers platform  \n11:56\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0s/not/now  \n11:58\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0a build on enterprise triggers a build on platform?  \n11:58\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0didn`t we change that with the new layout?  \n11:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: yes it's a cyclic dependency, how are we going to release platform if it depends on XE \u00a0?  \n11:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0with your changes, yes  \n11:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the type of the project does not matter  \n12:04\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so the problem is that you can not just build from start to finish either the platform or the enterprise, because they have some interlinked modules that would require partial build of both.  \n12:06\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes  \n12:06\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0technical or no it does not make any sense that platform depends on something that is by definition unknown at platform level...  \n12:08\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but then how does the enterprise and platform builds succeed on jenkins?  \n12:10\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: I see it as platform deppending on an artefact that's supposed to be on the repository, much like any other dependency. In this case, it's an artefact produced by enterprise.  \n12:10\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0now, if this causes cycles, then I agree that it's not good.  \n12:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it succeeded because XE xar was already built  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: even if it didn't cause cycles it's not good, platform should never depend on XE  \n12:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: I don't understand how you can see as something normal that platform depends on things that are produced by XE  \n12:12\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so tmortagne, on a clean repository, it would not succeed, right?  \n12:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes it would not  \n12:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0when you build platform it's not going to find XE stuff  \n12:12\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes, you are right.  \n12:13\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I looked at it as artefacts, but should have looked at it as full releases.  \n12:14\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so the problem is the workspace-template module  \n12:14\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0which generates a modified XE xar  \n12:14\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and the workspaces-ui module which uses that modified XE xar to attach it to the Install page.  \n12:15\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0we could unlink the workspaces-ui and workspaces-template modules by not attaching it automatically, and leaving the user to do it  \n12:15\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but then the workspace-template module would still have to be outside platform`s build  \n12:15\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: as I said in github something that needs XE xar looks like a distribution to me and not a platform module  \n12:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0XE is just one distribution among others  \n12:16\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since it's in platform workspaces should work with anything  \n12:16\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0an alternative could be a rewrite... I could put the extra pages and make the extra changes that I was doing by using velocity instead of a maven artefact  \n12:17\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0at workspace creation time  \n12:17\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it's not elegant, but maven`s happy  \n12:17\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and it can take a regular XE xar as template instead  \n12:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0or you can do that at XE level  \n12:18\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes, the alternative is to add the workspace-template module as part of XE (if this is what you mean)... but isn't this a bit weird?  \n12:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0since XE and workspaces are not exactly related  \n12:19\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0if this is considered acceptable, then it might be the quickest solution.  \n12:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0XE depends on workspaces so it knows about it  \n12:21\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I see...  \n12:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0what is this xar used for ?  \n12:21\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0template for the created workspaces (subwikis)  \n12:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0then should be done at XEM level actually probably  \n12:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0especially sicne XEm already have this xar...  \n12:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's not very nice to have the XE xar in several pages  \n12:22\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, this xar is diferent from XEM`s xar by the fact that it has some extra pages or some minor modifications.  \n12:23\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0if I would go for the other alternative (the rewrite) then probably I could reuse XEM`s xar  \n12:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you need to depend on the XE XAR?  \n12:23\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0a subwiki template xar is basically a regular XE xar + modifications  \n12:23\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0thus I depend on the regular XE xar (with the maven approach)  \n12:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: the only goal of XE xar in XEM is to provide a default template  \n12:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the fact that you added some page stil make it a duplicate  \n12:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so replace the one currently on by yours if you prefer  \n12:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but there should be only one IMO  \n12:24\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, the goal of the template in workspaces is to be the only template used automatically when creating a workspace  \n12:24\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so the user does not choose (like in XEM) which template to use or what to import  \n12:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: btw is workspaces included in XE ?  \n12:28\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0no, it is just included in the platform. It is not bundled with XE  \n12:28\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0it is to be installed as an extension by the user, per request  \n12:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok so XE does not depends on it then  \n12:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0so it should really not be done at XE level  \n12:28\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I guess it shouldn`t  \n12:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyway it should noyt be packaged with XE for the same reason wiki manager is not  \n12:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0yes  \n12:29\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so I`m only left with the rewrite alternative  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not even  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0maven is not the issue  \n12:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0moving the dependency from maven to velocity does not change anything for me  \n12:31\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, it does not affect the build/release  \n12:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n12:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0again it's the build is not the issue  \n12:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0workspaces is a platform module  \n12:31\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0as such it should not know about XE  \n12:32\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anywhere that be pom.xml or velocity or anything  \n12:32\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0well, then any of the platform modules should not know of any other projects outside the platform (junit, jmock, common-utils, etc)  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: no  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0theses are dependencies  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0platform is a dependency of XE  \n12:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it not about what is outside of platform  \n12:34\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0when handling it from velocity, I just treat it as an user given XAR that happens to be the XE xar  \n12:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0cyclic dependency issue is not just some maven limitation  \n12:34\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0but do know that this implies runtime stuff  \n12:34\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and at runtime all the builds are complete  \n12:34\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0and the artefacts exist  \n12:35\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0in build time, there was the cyclic problem  \n12:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0have to go for lunch  \n12:36\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0so the only solution right now as far as I can see (and have been told) would be a new product :|  \n12:36\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0(if we completely reject the velocity approach)  \n12:39\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0(lunch also)  \n12:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: you need to make a proposal quickly about fixing this or we'll have to revert your commit since we need to release XE soon now and it's \u00a0no go if platform has a dep on XE  \n13:17\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0back  \n13:25\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:34\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n13:42\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0sent a vote request on the list  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys fyi I'll be offline from 14:00 till 16:00, I'll reconnect after  \n14:05\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n14:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n14:07\u00a0<JuanDaugherty>\u00a0is UTC or CET assumed here?  \n14:07\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0I`m also offline for about 2hours.
