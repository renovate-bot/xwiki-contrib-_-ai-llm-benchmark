I'm planning on writing a simple addition to xwiki (plugin or script). I'm here to get some ideas about how to do it.  \nziggystar - (17:17): What: I want to be able to define bibtex entries (as Objects?) and cite them in text.  \nziggystar - (17:18): I want to extend this to something useable like a bibtex manager with import/export to \\*.bib files, but lets start simple.  \nziggystar - (17:19): As I see it now I need to define a new object class BibtexItem and a macro to define new items by simply wrapping the bibtex code. Maybe later a editor would be nice to have. There should be several ways to render them.  \nziggystar - (17:20): Question: How would I do this? Currently I think I could start with defining the class in Groovy and then have a macro which parses bibtex code and creates the object.  \ntmortagne - (17:21): ziggystar: hi, i don't know bibtex very well but you will find how to create macros on http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/RenderingModule#HAddinganewMacro  \nziggystar - (17:22): I've already read through those short tutorials already. I'm trying to figure out which means to use (whether creating a plugin, application, macro, etc.).  \ntmortagne - (17:22): then in a script you can ask for the XDOM of the document containing your bibtex markers and you will get then as MacroBlock java objects  \ntmortagne - (17:23): plugins are the old deprecated way  \ntmortagne - (17:23): for the UI you should write an application inndeed  \nziggystar - (17:23): So I could make one big page containing macros which create these objects. And from another page I can reference these objects and render them in the desired way?  \nziggystar - (17:23): For now I want to create the objects simply by parsing some string.  \ntmortagne - (17:23): and to do th real work you could implement a componenet and expose some api to the script/UI using ScriptService component interface  \ntmortagne - (17:24): ziggystar: macro will not create objects  \nziggystar - (17:24): Ah. First thing learned.  \ntmortagne - (17:24): macro will just mark the bibtex in the document content to easily find it  \ntmortagne - (17:25): if you need object you could listen to document modification even in a component and generate obejct based on the found bibtex merkers  \ntmortagne - (17:25): markers  \nziggystar - (17:25): Hmmm, of course I could simply scan the big page and extract the things I want to display each time a page needs to render some of the objects?  \nziggystar - (17:26): That way I would only need to do some basic text extraction.  \ntmortagne - (17:26): sure, generate xobject would be more to be ablre to write query to find all the bibtex in a wiki for example  \ntmortagne - (17:26): but in t a page by page basis you only need the simple rendering macros to \"mark\" where bibtex are  \nziggystar - (17:27): Hmm, that's of course thing I might need later (finding all bibtex entries inside the wiki).  \nziggystar - (17:28): Btw. Here is what such an entry looks like:  \nziggystar - (17:28): \u00a0@article{lin1973,  \nziggystar - (17:28): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0author \u00a0= {Shen Lin and Brian W. Kernighan},  \nziggystar - (17:28): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0title \u00a0\u00a0= {An Effective Heuristic Algorithm for the Travelling-Salesman Problem},  \nziggystar - (17:28): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0journal = {Operations Research},  \nziggystar - (17:28): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0volume \u00a0= {21},  \nziggystar - (17:28): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0year \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= {1973},  \nziggystar - (17:28): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pages \u00a0\u00a0= {498--516},  \nziggystar - (17:28): \u00a0}  \nziggystar - (17:28): And when rendering it, you only take some of the properties and display them in a special way.  \nziggystar - (17:29): So creating objects would be the more efficient way and goes into the direction of building a bibtex database inside the wiki?  \ntmortagne - (17:30): does a bibtex apply on the whole page or its place in the content counts ?  \ntmortagne - (17:30): s/counts/matter/  \ntmortagne - (17:31): i'm just think you probably not needs any macro actually, either you create a new bibtex type of annotation or you directly create object if a bibtex is about the whole content  \ntmortagne - (17:32): now i don't know how you can create a new kind of annotation  \nziggystar - (17:32): The bibtex items are descriptions of publications. You want to have a collection of them. Then when writing a text, you cite certain items from that collection during the text. Usually a reference like [Lin1973] is created there and a list of all cited publications is created at the end of the text.  \ntmortagne - (17:32): lucaa: is it already possible ?  \nziggystar - (17:33): So basically the whole wiki contributes the items. Then on pages you can use (cite) these items. One item can be cited several times on different pages.  \nlucaa - (17:33): tmortagne: it's easily possible to change the type of annotation  \nlucaa - (17:33): but they will all have the same type, that's the limitation  \ntmortagne - (17:33): ziggystar: ok so it would indeed be either a macro or an annotation but i'm not sure annotation are the right thing here  \ntmortagne - (17:34): lucaa: WFYT ?  \ntmortagne - (17:34): WDYT  \nlucaa - (17:34): tmortagne: lemme read  \nlucaa - (17:34): I think you need macro  \nlucaa - (17:35): because annotations are \\_not\\_ part of the content, they are an extra layer, you don't see them when you edit, etc  \ntmortagne - (17:35): ziggystar: a macro would be something like {{bibtex author=\"Shen Lin and Brian W. Kernighan\" journal=\"Operations Research\" /}} you put in your content  \ntmortagne - (17:35): lucaa: yep that's why i was not sure  \nziggystar - (17:35): Yes.  \nlucaa - (17:35): bibliography entries though, and references to them, are part of the content. When you write your document you want to cite them, see the citations, edit, etc  \nziggystar - (17:35): The citing would most certainly be a macro.  \nlucaa - (17:36): yes, I would say named objects (object which has a key and holds all the bib fields)  \nlucaa - (17:36): \u00a0and then a macro to be called with the key  \nlucaa - (17:36): the macro would generate a reference text, and then the objects can be displayed at the end in alphabetical order with another macro  \ntmortagne - (17:36): ziggystar: then when you receive a document modification event you get the document XDOM and search for all the bibtex macros in it to generate objects based on it  \nziggystar - (17:38): Sorry, had a phone call. Yes that sounds good.  \ntmortagne - (17:38): indeed the macro would not contains the information but an id probably  \ntmortagne - (17:38): {{bibtex id=\"lin1973\"/}}  \ntmortagne - (17:38): if i underatood well you example of entry  \ntmortagne - (17:38): s/underatood/understood/  \nziggystar - (17:39): So there are three kinds of macros now. 1st is for defining the item, they get parsed into objects. 2nd is for citing them and 3rd is for generating the reference list at the end of a page.  \nlucaa - (17:39): I wouldn't say you need a macro to define them  \ntmortagne - (17:39): and as lucaa said the real entried would be located in dedicated page with an object in it indicating it's a bibtex entry  \nlucaa - (17:39): you just need a simple form to save it in an object  \nziggystar - (17:40): Those objects, they are contained inside a page?  \nlucaa - (17:40): yes  \ntmortagne - (17:40): ziggystar: yep  \nlucaa - (17:40): so in your page you'd have the objects with the biblio of that page, and these objects will define each entry once, and a key for the entry  \nziggystar - (17:40): I thought I mark the entries inside the page by using a macro and then aprse the page and create the objects.  \ntmortagne - (17:40): so:  \ntmortagne - (17:40): - entry object  \ntmortagne - (17:40): - maker macros  \ntmortagne - (17:40): - marker object (for indexing and search)  \nlucaa - (17:41): then, when you cite them, you use {{cite key=\"lin1973\" /}} in text where you need it  \nlucaa - (17:41): and then, at the end of the text, you could use another macro:  \nlucaa - (17:41): {{makebiblio /}}  \nlucaa - (17:41): to display all the object nicely formatted in a list, potentially in alphabetical order  \ntmortagne - (17:41): s/maker/cite/  \nziggystar - (17:42): I don't get what the marker/cite object is for.  \nlucaa - (17:42): to actually specify where in text you cite the entry  \nlucaa - (17:42): you don't want that?  \ntmortagne - (17:42): ziggystar: to search page containing cites  \nziggystar - (17:42): Ah, so you can backreference?  \ntmortagne - (17:42): yep  \nlucaa - (17:43): for example:  \nlucaa - (17:43): \"Linux is the sexiest operating system in the world [42] although some would say the mac is [13].\"  \nziggystar - (17:43): Like finding all pages citing this entry. Hmm, that's nice but not really important. Something to add later maybe.  \ntmortagne - (17:43): but there is several ways to do that, you could also have a dedicated index system  \ntmortagne - (17:43): but puting obect in the page conteining the cites reduce synchronization issues IMO  \nziggystar - (17:43): So basically I need those bibtex objects and then a macro to cite them and one to create the bibliography at the end of a page.  \nlucaa - (17:43): I would say, yes  \ntmortagne - (17:43): yep  \nziggystar - (17:44): Ok. One more thing. I have to decide upon the language to use. I can do Java but none of the scripting languages, so I have to learn one.  \nziggystar - (17:44): How would I define the class for the entries?  \nziggystar - (17:45): Using a Java plugin? Or I've seen it can also be done using Groovy onsite.  \ntmortagne - (17:45): ziggystar: java is probably the easiest to write and test for the macros  \ntmortagne - (17:45): for the class you can simply use the class editor UI  \ntmortagne - (17:45): and put in a a xar to import in the wiki ate first  \ntmortagne - (17:46): then latter you could automatically generate the class in java  \nziggystar - (17:46): Ok, I haven't found that editor yet. I'll check it out. XAR sounds easy. :)  \ntmortagne - (17:46): ziggystar: enabel advenced user in your user profile  \nziggystar - (17:46): And how would I go about creating objects of the class. You've mentioned a form.  \nziggystar - (17:46): First I thought about a macro that converts a string into an object.  \nziggystar - (17:47): But you said this doesn't work.  \ntmortagne - (17:47): then when you are in a page you let lot's of editors when the mouse in over the EDIT menu  \ntmortagne - (17:47): ziggystar: use the class wyzard  \ntmortagne - (17:47): it will create some form for you  \ntmortagne - (17:48): let me see if i can find documentation about it  \ntmortagne - (17:48): ziggystar: go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiClasses  \nziggystar - (17:48): I've found that wizard.  \ntmortagne - (17:48): in your wiki  \nziggystar - (17:49): This looks promising.  \nziggystar - (17:49): I'll have a try with it.  \ntmortagne - (17:51): ziggystar: btw we provide svn/ci for XWiki based project if you are interested. See http://contrib.xwiki.org  \nziggystar - (17:51): I'll publish the result if I can get it working. It's been asked for a while ago.  \nziggystar - (17:52): But first I have to get going with this xwiki stuff and see if it suits me. But I think it might work out nicely.  \ntmortagne - (17:53): sure that was an early advertisement ;)  \ntmortagne - (17:55): i have to go, good luck ziggystar :)  \ntmortagne left at 17:55 (Quit: Leaving.  \nj-saturne left at 17:56 (Quit: Leaving.  \nfmancinelli left at 18:01 (Ping timeout: 276 seconds  \nabusenius left at 18:05 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nlucaa - (18:16): guys, I just sent a mail about the possible approaches for implementing the gadgets system in xwiki (with or without open social support). Could you have a look at it and tell me how you feel?  \nlucaa - (18:17): as I am pretty sure it's not clear enough (but I tried to make it a short mail), you can ask here for more explanations or on the list  \nlucaa - (18:17): thanks  \nlucaa - (18:17): a lot  \nziggystar - (18:32): It looks as if I'm able to create what I need only by using the web interface. Defining a class using a wizard and writing some scripts. That's actually very impressive.  \nziggystar left at 18:34 (Quit: ziggystar  \nziggystar joined #xwiki at 18:37  \nlpereira joined #xwiki at 18:37  \nziggystar - (18:55): Is there any further documentation on this query stuff besides the \"Query Guide\" Page?  \nziggystar - (18:57): And: I'm supposed to use $services.query.xwql(\"query\").execute() . But the scripting page doesn't list \"services\" as an available object.
