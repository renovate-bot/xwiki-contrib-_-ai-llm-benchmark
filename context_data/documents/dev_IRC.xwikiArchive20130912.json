 \n09:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(methods and classes)  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are several metrics  \n09:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"undoc api\" is public methods I guess  \n09:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess it does not look only at non internal packages  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0internal packages are included yes surely  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe we can tune this  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0even though  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it's good to document them too  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's good to document everything but internal package is not really API  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it is internal API  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to useful for all xwiki devs  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/to/so  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when we do maintenance for ex  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0like private methods  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah almost  \n09:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway, lets looks at old bugs on jira for today  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0would be nice to decide some point where we move this day to a \"sonar day\" for some time  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well we said that we wanted to continue the BFD every week till the end of the 5.X cycle  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we could also have a sonar day once per month or more for now  \n09:11\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol, mflorea: on the latest xwiki-manager-jetty-hsqldb I can't login with the Admin user, the translations don't work and I get this in the console: http://hastebin.com/qivoxupidi.avrasm  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or we wait till the end of the 5.x cycle  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: manager is removed  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't use it  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll remove it from the ci  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n09:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm fine with waiting for 6.x, just saying sonar days would be nice and provide lots of idea with direct metric and progress to see  \n09:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: I didn't know that. Yesterday I tested on another snapshot and it worked  \n09:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: good morning.  \n09:14\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I have the latest Enterprise snapshot, but I can't find were I can create a wiki (workspaces)  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0msmeria: done: http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Manager/job/xwiki-manager/  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: you need to go to admin  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and setup the wiki template first  \n09:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like activate the wiki feature  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: we didn't want to show the \"add wiki\" button if it was not going to work  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is good but it also makes the feature less discoverable  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it may not be that bad  \n09:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ATM an admin needs to activate it first which is maybe not that bad  \n09:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0indeed  \n09:16\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I have now add wiki  \n09:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9402 is showing in today's BFD but it was done in the past BFD but more fixes were added yesterday...  \n09:25\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0seems I get some conflicts in a workspaces DW  \n09:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0we'll have a lot of things to polish :)  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: you're not supposed to get DW  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just because of a bug AFAIK  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie it appears because your version is SNAPSHOT  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a jira for this created by guillaumeD  \n09:29\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0might be, I'll test after the release  \n09:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not really because the version is snapshot, it because the XAR you import cannot be found in any of the repositories you have  \n09:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you add the snapshot repository it should be ok  \n09:49\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:57\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:04\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:10\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0thx mflorea for this commit  \n10:10\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0np  \n10:17\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n10:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:32\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:50\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0artanis  \n10:53\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:56\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n11:03\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n11:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/7d113c44e5c3e82cba5e050584049df2acb6d733 is impressive contribution, 2,029 additions  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: search suggest doesn't seem to work for me by default  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if I search for \"test\" then I get no results in suggest but when hitting enter I get results in the solr search page results  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok my bad  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was a cache issue  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah found a bug  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you click on \"show all results\" and there's one result it goes to that page and not to the search page result  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example search for \"welcome\"  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is with the arrow keys  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so:  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01- search for \"welcome\"  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02- move down with arrow keys  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03- press enter on \"show all results\"  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(on chrome)  \n11:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0vmassol: did you also made modifications to the way you edit a color theme ?  \n11:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no why?  \n11:12\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0now you no longer have to click on the button to edit the colors for a certain section  \n11:13\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0and once you start editing an element (for ex.

I guess you can change the database name in the hibernate.cfg.xml but will the \"xwiki\" id used in document identifiers be remapped to the correct db name?  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fmancinelli: I think it's possible to configure a different name for the main wiki DB but I wouldn't bet 100% that all work (haven't tried it)  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0xwiki.db=xwiki  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's supposed to work  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could try it  \n12:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: use xwiki.db if you have only one wiki in your instance but xwiki.db.prefix is better when you have several (i.e. several XEM on the same MySQL)  \n12:28\u00a0<Slashman\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n12:34\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0fmancinelli: my use case is to have 2 XE for two projects on the same MySql. The one will use database A, the second will use database B. Now in both wikis I will have identifiers like xwiki:XWiki.Admin and not A:XWiki.Admin and B:XWiki.Admin. WIll xwiki:Wiki.Admin work on A and B? :) Anyway I'll check this out  \n12:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: the wiki id is not the same as the database name  \n12:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki.db and xwiki.db.prefix are used by the hibernate storage to find the name of the database from the wiki id  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yes the main wiki will stay \"xwiki\" no whatever the name of the actual dabase  \n12:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. XWikiContext#getDatabase is a very bad naming  \n12:37\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ok cool  \n13:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n13:13\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:26\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:31\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n13:32\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:38\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n13:41\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:55\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n13:55\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:15\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:36\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: ping  \n14:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I can't reproduce http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6161, maybe you remember something special you did  \n14:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I think it just started the wiki and typed the reset url without editing any page  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I' can retry locally  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so rest a page without any history  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0trying that  \n14:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't remember  \n14:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/rest/reset/  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: that's it  \n14:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n14:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I can reproduce it with an original page that never been modified  \n15:06\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:15\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:17\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n15:57\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n16:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: this is for you: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9439  \n17:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: ok thx  \n17:02\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I'll do it Monday because it's BFD today  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this one too: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9440  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: this is a bug  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so a good candidate for BFD if you want ;)  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0your choice  \n17:03\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: yes but you have created it today, it doesn't count ^^  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok ok  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as you wish  \n17:08\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:08\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:09\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:29\u00a0<camil7>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you sure you want to handle XWATCH-195 ?  \n17:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since xwatch has been retired for some time now  \n18:19\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: No, I won't handle it  \n18:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok was a mistake I guess  \n18:37\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone knows where's the code that handles the ctrl+g popup behavior?  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found it  \n18:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jumpToPage.js  \n19:00\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:13\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0a pull request for the BFD...  \n19:30\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:34\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n19:35\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:39\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0good evening  \n19:39\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<UCC>\u00a0has quit  \n21:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:04\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0266 active installs so far  \n22:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
