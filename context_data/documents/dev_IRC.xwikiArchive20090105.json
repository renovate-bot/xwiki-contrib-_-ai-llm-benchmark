I need to avoid it)  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:48): so, vmassol\\_, is there a single way to do it with <% ? Is there a velocity's out ?  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:48): (I couldn't find one)  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:49): polx: I don't know  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:50): too bad a too late... thanks still  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:50): I think the answer  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:50): is that if you're using parseGroovyFromPage you're calling that from velocity and you don't print in the script, you just call methods that return content  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:50): which you print in velocity  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:51): except if your groovy script is precisely... a renderer...   \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:51): but I may be wrong and thre may be a way  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:51): that sure works!  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:51): right  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:51): but giving back a string of 200-300kb is no good style I find.  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:55): polx: I've asked ludovic and he doesn't know of a solution either so I'd say that's not possible  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:55): I'll file an issue for the future of the world then...  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:55): too too bad. thx much vmassol\\_  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:56): unless you haven't sent anything back in the response I guess  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:56): hmm that's the too early  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:56): the response is there but things written to the response from velocity are printed before the header... that's no good.  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:56): have you tried calling context.setFinished(true)?  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:57): I guess what would be needed is the thread-local or something like that that wraps the velocity stream  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:58): funny, I haven't...  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:59): it should work if you use it  \npolx - (05/01/2009 23:59): a dark hack it seem  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:59): since we're checking for it when we return fro parseTemplate  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:59): no it's a feature!   \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:59): :)  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:59): we've had the need in some other cases  \nvmassol\\_ - (05/01/2009 23:59): (but not from groovy)  \n\n"}
