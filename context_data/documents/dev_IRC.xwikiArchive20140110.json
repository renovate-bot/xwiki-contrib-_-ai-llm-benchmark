I'm just a bit worried that we're introducing a lot of stuff in a RC version.

I thought not giving it a \"Fix Version\" does that.  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm still surprised it works across the board but good if it does :)  \n11:46\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: yep, old javadoc, thanks  \n11:49\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:50\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0Hi all, we are playing with subwikis and we have something we don't understand... We have a xwiki:XWiki.Admin global user which belongs to xwiki:XWiki.AdminGroup. In the subwiki we don't have any local XWiki.Admin user.  \n11:51\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0now what we don't understand is that in the subwiki the following call return false $xwiki.user.isUserInGroup(\"xwiki:XWiki.AdminGroup\") while being xwiki:XWiki.Admin  \n11:51\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0while we expected it to return true  \n11:52\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0any idea?  \n11:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0fmancinelli: I guess it means XWikiUser does not take into account the wiki and just look in current wiki  \n11:54\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0or the user making the call cannot access the xwiki:XWiki.AdminGroup (maybe?)  \n11:54\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0That's what we guess too...  \n11:54\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0tmortagne: yep, that's what we thought - is it a bug or a feature? :)  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0definitely a bug  \n11:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0now XWikiUser is not really used in XE, we use rightsmanager plugin instead  \n11:55\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ah  \n11:55\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0so maybe we are doing it using a deprecated way  \n11:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0lets say rightsmanager and the most recent way  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but it's still not a perfect user/group manager API  \n11:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyway isUserInGroup is not tagged as deprecated and has a bug so it deserve a jira issue IMO  \n11:58\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0ok I will create an issue  \n12:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n12:04\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n12:16\u00a0<zenzla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:18\u00a0<zenzla2>\u00a0has quit  \n12:30\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, fyi, I'm on holidays this afternoon (sorry to not have mentioned this earlier). I'll be connected around end of afternoon though  \n12:55\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: could you give your opinion on the mail I've sent on devslist about XWiki + Activiti ? About naming the jira project  \n12:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: you pick the name you wish  \n12:56\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: I know, just wanted your opinion :)  \n12:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0AFAICS it's more an application  \n12:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it choses to use activitii in a certain directed way and a subset of it  \n12:57\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I was confused because CRaAS has also some UI, but you called it Integration. This is why I am a little bit confused  \n12:58\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0okay, I am going to reply to the thread and the wait for someone to create the repo and the project  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I can create the repo now  \n12:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0application-activiti is ok?  \n12:59\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: yes  \n12:59\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0also replied on the thread  \n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0done  \n13:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-activiti  \n13:01\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0thanks vmassol ! :)  \n13:15\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0vmassol: I think there is something wrong with 5.2.3.

 \n17:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0i.e. create a template and then create a wiki from this template  \n17:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't see anything wrong in what he is doing and looks like the template is not copied, that would be a major bug  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so I'm wondering if you tested it on 5.3 already  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see if it's only him or a real general issue  \n17:34\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, bug or not? \"XWiki Platform - User - UI\", installed version 5.3, available version 5.0.3, XWiki 5.3  \n17:35\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: not sure I understand exactly what you mean  \n17:37\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:37\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: http://img2.stooorage.com/images/2540/10676952\\_wiki.png  \n17:40\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, i guess bad choice of image storage web :) sorry for those ads, if you don't use adblock  \n17:41\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0http://img24.eu/images/4tlfdsw.png \u00a0should be ok  \n17:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the result you get does not make much sense, even for the fist two (they obviously don't seems to be needed)  \n17:46\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0ok then  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the extension updater should not propose them to you as far as I understand  \n17:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0are you in the main wiki or a subwiki ?  \n17:46\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0subwiki  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what version of XWiki is it ?  \n17:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a05.3 stable  \n17:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you upgraded from 5.1 ?  \n17:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yes  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you fully upgraded the wiki ? because from what I see it does not seems to be the case since solr search seems to be in version 5.1  \n17:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe the issue is that your UI is still in 5.1  \n17:49\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yes, full upgrade, but there seems to be some errors (initial window showed several times, couldnt update some extensions), so i tried this manually (but everything else seems to work)  \n17:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0your wiki seems to be in a weird state  \n17:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have solr in 5.1, message stream in 5.0  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0both are standard XE dependencies  \n17:50\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0well, the list of extensions is larger  \n17:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't know why you don't have the upgrade button for them  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seems according to the UI it found 5.3 and you have 5.1 for example for solr  \n17:51\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe the EM UI itself is not up to date and is incompatible with 5.3 backend  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should probably try to import Extension Manager UI by hand (with standard importer)  \n17:53\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-extension-ui/5.3/  \n17:54\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0hmm, it seems i have two versions of EM UI installed, 5.1 and 5.3  \n17:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0on that wiki ? or when you look in main wiki ?  \n17:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(main wiki give information for all wikis)  \n17:55\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0on that wiki, on main it shows only 5.3  \n17:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when you say you \"so i tried this manually\" what did you do exactly ?  \n17:57\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0just clicked on \"Extension Updater\" :)  \n17:58\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0but it's possible something broke during update... i will try it later again (this is testing instance)  \n17:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the best is probably to retry the upgrade from scratch and report the exact issues you have especially the \"couldnt update some extensions\"  \n17:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0because I don't have much idea of how you can end up with two version of the same extension installed on the same wiki  \n17:59\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yep... but everything else seems to work  \n18:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yep it's possible you have the right page or at least pages that works will 5.3 backend but looks like your extensions index is not in a good state  \n18:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you might want to check if installed extensions seems correct before the upgrade itself  \n18:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe you already had issues before the upgrade which lost it  \n18:01\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0it's possible  \n18:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:20\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<zenzla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:29\u00a0<zenzla2>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:44\u00a0<Guest31462>\u00a0has quit  \n18:47\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:48\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:56\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:02\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n19:08\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:19\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:26\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:26\u00a0<Kebir>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:29\u00a0<zenzla>\u00a0has quit  \n19:35\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n19:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:45\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:51\u00a0<Kebir>\u00a0has quit  \n19:51\u00a0<zenzla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:27\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n20:31\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:34\u00a0<Kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n20:35\u00a0<zenzla>\u00a0has quit  \n20:37\u00a0<zenzla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:06\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:25\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:58\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n23:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:28\u00a0<zenzla2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:30\u00a0<zenzla2>\u00a0has quit  \n23:31\u00a0<zenzla>\u00a0has quit  \n23:40\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit\n"}
