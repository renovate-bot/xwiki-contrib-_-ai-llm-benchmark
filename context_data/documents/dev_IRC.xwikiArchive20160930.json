On navigating to the menu entry it says: 'The requested page could not be found.' how can i delete this ghost entries from the navigation?  \n09:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0rfidna: there might be some hidden children pages, that's why it might be still displayed in the Tree  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rfidna: hi  \n09:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0you should change the Profile type to view hidden pages and delete them also (if you don't need them). You might not have check to also delete children, when you deleted the page.  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think it just means that you deled the page but it has children  \n09:12\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0If there are no children, there might be some hidden translations for that page. Investigate these 2 options.  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*deleted  \n09:13\u00a0<rfidna>\u00a0thank you let me check this  \n09:19\u00a0<rfidna>\u00a0well I have no idea if i just cannot find the hidden elements or if there are no such elements  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rfidna: if you wish to display hidden docs, see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/User+Profile+Application#HEditPreferences  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@evalica: from a UX POV, I think we could improve the doc tree to display a message like \"5 hidden documents\" when there's no children nodes under a node  \n09:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll create a jira issue  \n09:31\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0k  \n09:32\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0testing first ;)  \n09:33\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0Hello there, I'm having a problem with xwiki rights, I can't manage to take out Wiki admin right from XWikiAllGroup, could someone send me the default rights?  \n09:34\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_2>\u00a0I mean the object one, I think I messed it up  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rfidna/evalica: first, when you dleete a page you'll be shown hidden children pages even if your user is configured to not display hidden pages  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0let's imagine I didn't see it...  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no it works fine  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the doc tree works fine  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't the parent entry if it's been deleted and children are empty  \n09:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0so if the problem ar not children, you should check for translations  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/empty/hidden  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i don't think that's the problem iether  \n09:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0for example, if you delete Sandbox\u2026. it will still be displayed  \n09:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0since Sandbox has a lot of translation pages  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0translations would appear in the tree under a Translation node  \n09:37\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0if the tree is configured to display translations, but the navigation tree is using compact mode, with less informations  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so rfidna, what tree are you using?  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"'Page Index' -> 'Tree' tab.\"  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so evalica it's not the breadcrumb tree  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that tree displays Translations under a Translations node  \n09:39\u00a0<rfidna>\u00a0@vmassol \"'Page Index' -> 'Tree' tab.\" is right  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think what happened  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is that you have a WebPreferences page for your page  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ie you played with page administration)  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and when you deleted the page you didn't deleted children  \n09:39\u00a0<rfidna>\u00a0yes i did ... on one of the entries i can not delete  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0turn on hidden docs  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as i mentioned  \n09:40\u00a0<rfidna>\u00a0they are enabled  \n09:40\u00a0<rfidna>\u00a0\u00a0-> shown  \n09:40\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0why can't you delete it?
