 \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: checking the tests to try to see wht's wrong  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when I look at the stack trace  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see a template problem  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so my guess is that this is possibly caused by thomas's template refactoring  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(all I did was work on the mail sending anyway)  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/afa916b647ff9798126e/raw/e7e9d12dea63462ea2bb12d063521cd0801c19c4/gistfile1.txt  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so either template or skin extension  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could be that memory is low from other stuff and the error just happens here because it requires some memory at that time  \n11:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0wonder why that does not happen on master as well  \n11:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I guess we`ll wait on Monday for Thomas to have a look  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0is it always failing?  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(across different job executions)  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it is then it's likely the issue is in the registration module (and possibly a combination with template/sx)  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if not, then it's just bad luck the OOM happens there  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm the problem is that our tests always execute in the same order  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's possible it'll always fail there ;)  \n11:45\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:54\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:26\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0might be fun if we could randomize the test execution order on each run :)  \n13:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: actually thomas released 6.4M1 a few daysa go  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and all jobs were passing  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it means the problem was introduced in the mast 1 or 2 days  \n13:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*last  \n13:49\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<AFKGeek>\u00a0has quit  \n14:54\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:01\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:41\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:10\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has quit  \n16:25\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n16:25\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:06\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:14\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:51\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:02\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:24\u00a0<othercjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:24\u00a0<othercjd>\u00a0playing with js irc client  \n18:28\u00a0<othercjd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:28\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:30\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n18:32\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:36\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:37\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:55\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n19:03\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has quit  \n19:15\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:17\u00a0<xwikiorg\\_guest\\_3>\u00a0has quit  \n19:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:25\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:53\u00a0<MrHeavy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:54\u00a0<MrHeavy>\u00a0Is anything up with the extensions repository?
