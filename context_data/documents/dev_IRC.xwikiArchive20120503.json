The problem is that even if you don't use the link plugin (i.e. the XWiki Explorer tree), because the wysiwyg GWT module \"inherits\" the smartGWT module, there is some smartGWT code executed when the editor is loaded, which fails is smartClient is not present..  \n13:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. last time I tried to see how fast the WYSIWYG edit mode loads without the smartClient code, I failed because the editor fails to load..  \n13:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I doubt they changed something in the mean time in smartGWT  \n13:49\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so you'd have to recompile the editor without the \"inheritance\" of the smartGWT module  \n13:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0mflorea, OK, is that easy to do ?  \n13:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0like in not too much changes to make to sources  \n13:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I think you just have to comment one line, in Wysiwyg.gwt.xml, the module descriptor  \n13:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0at the start  \n13:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0let me try  \n13:52\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0ok  \n13:52\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I'm trying \"as is\" in the mean time  \n13:54\u00a0<qbert-->\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:56\u00a0<qbert-->\u00a0Hi, can anybody tell me how can I manage space creation rights?

It gets the WYSIWYG editor config so it can check which JS plugins to load. It needs to expose 3 thinks to the JS plugins: (1) the config, (2) the command manager (this is almost done, need to add support for command listeners) and (3) selection API (to reuse it from JS)  \n15:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I mean, one GWT plugin that loads all JS plugins  \n15:35\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0this \"loading\" could be a simple event triggered, that has the config, command manager, iframe/textarea, selection as data, and JS code could listen to this event  \n15:35\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0mflorea, OK, I'm going to try that.. it's likely you can expect me to come with more questions :)  \n15:35\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0sounds good to me  \n15:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there is already an action event mechanism, but I don't think it has parameters/data  \n15:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0editor.addActionHandler(actionName, handler)  \n15:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0from JS  \n15:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0right now there are only a few loading \"actions\" (events) fired, e.g. when switching to source tab or to the WYSIWYG tab  \n15:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0and ofc, ping me when you have questions  \n15:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n15:45\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:59\u00a0<CIA-74>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* rb266533\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/b2665332d18b15cc0a71b40a1053dc638422393a \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-query/xwiki-platform-query-manager/src/main/java/org/xwiki/query/internal/SecureQueryExecutorManager.java :\u000f XWIKI-7756: Impossible to execute request with query manager on another wiki without programming right - http://git.io/dbIa7A  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: I'm looking at your last commit.

It's not enough to just \"notify\" them.  \n16:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the Plugin interface has a method to return the UI extensions  \n16:23\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the JS plugins needs a similar mechanism to specify their extensions  \n16:23\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I see  \n16:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the GWT plugin will have to converte the data collected from JS plugins into proper extensions  \n16:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0I'll try to start off with something simple  \n16:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0e.g. toolbar extensions, menu extensions, etc.  \n16:24\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0yep  \n16:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0duplicated lines % warning: http://nemo.sonarsource.org/dashboard/index/314529  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think that's because I moved syntaxes  \n16:55\u00a0<qbert-->\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:48\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:52\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has quit  \n18:05\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:10\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:29\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:49\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n18:53\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:05\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:06\u00a0<CIA-74>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r537d5d8\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/537d5d83c2c39d66b3053bba6cff65532ba17828 \u000f/ (4 files in 4 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7782: Allow to reset LDAP group cache from the UI - http://git.io/qSPuZg  \n19:13\u00a0<CIA-74>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r9d03f36\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/9d03f36ab4be74e54fa6f8e1cb8632532612810f \u000f/ (2 files in 2 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7782: Allow to reset LDAP group cache from the UI ...  \n19:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n19:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:36\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:36\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n20:37\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n20:50\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:15\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n21:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:14\u00a0<aulius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:35\u00a0<pgmjsd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:48\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:48\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:53\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n23:17\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:30\u00a0<aulius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
