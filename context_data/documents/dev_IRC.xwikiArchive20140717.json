\n08:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's weird, looks like for some reason ohloh did not updated XWiki since more than a week, does not seems to be the case for other projects

branches instead of pull requests :)  \n09:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: they were already branches, I just found it easier to merge them with a pull request (2 clicks) :)  \n09:12\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0maybe you meant \"merges\" instead of \"branches\"  \n09:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n09:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0actually I meant branch, http://git.io/yT04gg being a pull request I tough it was  \n09:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0from the start (without me noticing it)  \n09:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is an issue in one pom by the way  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: good morning  \n09:15\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: good morning  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: you haven't replied to my mail regarding helping with the XWiki Days! :)  \n09:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: which one?  \n09:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0see my last git comment  \n09:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool, thanks Enygma` :)  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so let's start with next Thursday (today is a bit too last-moment I guess ;))  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah and next thursday is travelling day for a lot of committers ;)  \n09:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the ones from XWiki SAS at least)  \n09:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0lucky me, huh? :)  \n09:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you picked your timing well!  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0one thing, ideally you need to check the metrics associated with the various XWiki Days  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order to propose a specific day  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's one thing I'd like to keep that I was doing  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's checking regularly on the bugs closed/bugs created metric  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order to keep more bugs closed than created for the past 1600 days  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when we were loosing I was proposing a BFD but it seems we only needed once out of 2-3 times to keep up  \n09:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0right now we're at:  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03628 closed vs 3621 created  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we're winning  \n09:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and no need for a BFD  \n09:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0I see  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0dashboard is here if you don't have it already http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10352  \n09:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(top right)  \n09:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're only 375 bugs away in total btw, not too bad  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder what feeling it is to have 0 bugs opened :)  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0must be great  \n09:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0feeling that you're on top of your software  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/opened/open  \n09:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0or sad that you software is not used enough :P  \n09:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0there`s no such thing as 0 bugs software :)  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah it needs to be combined with active installs to ensure this doesn't happen :)  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I didn't say no bug  \n09:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I said no bug open  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n09:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0opened  \n09:35\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0:)  \n09:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not even opened, because when they're opened you closed them  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0within, say, 1 week  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0must be pretty cool  \n09:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0it would also mean that you`ve stopped development for your software a long time ago and only focused on bugs :)  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I guess there are really complex bugs, maybe they can recateogrized as improvmeents ;)  \n09:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and the fixes you introduced brought no new bugs :)  \n09:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know about that  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex with 1 BFD per day for a year we caught up a lot  \n09:37\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yep  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that still leaves 4 days per week on other stuff  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now the remaining 100 bugs or so must be real hard  \n09:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yeah, some of them might need serious refactorings or model changes and stuff  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why I said  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they could be relabelled as improvements maybe  \n09:38\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, some of them maybe  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for example if we take this one: \u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-1716  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this can be considered a limitation  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(thus an improvement)  \n09:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not necessarily a bug  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but then it might be cheating\u2026. ;) dunno  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case this one is doable  \n09:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(second oldest open bug)  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I like the widget on bottom right of the dashboard http://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10352  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0shows the versions of xwiki still having open bugs  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fun that old versions have 1 bug open each  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(till 1.1M3)  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no stupid me  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ordered by # of open bugs  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ahaha  \n09:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0well, they are still open  \n09:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a01 for each of those

 \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tried that I think,  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0trying again  \n16:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0method officially never contains \"public\"in the documentation, to description is not that clear  \n16:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm maybe it's not <method> but <constructor> or something like this but I doubt i  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no deice  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0dice  \n16:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't think so  \n16:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0unless http://mojo.codehaus.org/clirr-maven-plugin/examples/ignored-differences.html is wrong  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed http://mojo.codehaus.org/clirr-maven-plugin/examples/ignored-differences.html  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I also tried with \\* instead of public  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah found something that works  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0<method>MimeMessageWrapper\\*</method>  \n16:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you will have to find a 7005 in the history :)  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tried that too  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but couldn't find a constructor example ;)  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got something that passes, good enough for me  \n17:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0another possibility is to not break the API :)  \n17:02\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:02\u00a0<andreeapopescu\\_>\u00a0is now known as <andreeapopescu>  \n17:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yeah sure  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and not progress  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0strange, my avatar has changed on github  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commits/master  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm https://github.com/vmassol shows the right avatar though  \n17:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I see the same in both link  \n17:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0links  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re-uploading picture  \n17:07\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think they changed the max pic size  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or something like that  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I tried to upload the same again and they said it must be < 1MB  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm still not updated  \n17:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0try to clean your cache or something, I have the same image in both links  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you have a picture or some art image?  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ok now  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n17:10\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0very strange  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I push a commit  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which locally has the pom.xml change for clirr  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and on the server it doesn't contain it  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0pushed again  \n17:25\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Hi xwikiers  \n17:26\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I found a missing translations in ApplicationResources\\_fr.properties (and in all the other languages by the way but I can't do it)  \n17:26\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I wonder what the best way of fixing it  \n17:26\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Because I was one the verge of creating a simple pull request for this missing key  \n17:27\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0(for information, key is platform.appwithinminutes.appHomePageDeleteEntriesLabel)  \n17:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0woshilapin: translation contributions are on http://l10n.xwiki.org  \n17:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, I was looking at it  \n17:28\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Everything done there is reported directly on the Git ?  \n17:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in your case it's in http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Platform/XWikiCoreResources if I understood well  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0everything done here is put in git at each release  \n17:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's part of the release process  \n17:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0So, I better do it there  \n17:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes  \n17:29\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0That was the information missing, thanks  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0woshilapin: note that you have \"## XWiki Translation for language fr generated from http://www.l10n.xwiki.org\" in ApplicationResources\\_fr.properties but it's possible it's not clear enough  \n17:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or maybe you did not saw it ?  \n17:32\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I saw my key and I will propose a translation  \n17:32\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0My problem is that I know where it appears in the wiki and the exact translation may be a bit long for the UI  \n17:33\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And in the meanwhile, I wonder how I can create this translation key in my system, without waiting for the next release  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0woshilapin: using http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Localization+Module#HRegisterawikitranslation for example  \n17:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Is these \\*.properties files are transformed into a Translation wiki page?  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you can overwrite then in any wiki translation page  \n17:34\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so you can put your changes in a wiki translation page to test it  \n17:34\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, I'm aware of that but this means that the best way in my case is to create a new document with this key  \n17:35\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0What will happen when I will update to the last release  \n17:35\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0There will be 2 keys in the system  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0your wiki translation has priority over jar translation  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yours will be taken  \n17:36\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Ok  \n17:36\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0So I will add my key  \n17:36\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Thanks  \n17:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this is a way you can use when you don't like default translations or want some specific naming  \n17:36\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0And back to the proposition on l10n.xwiki.org  \n17:37\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Should I worry about the UI?  \n17:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what do you mean ?  \n17:38\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0I mean, the translation will be something like twice the number of characters of the english version  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ha I tough you were talking about the l10n wiki UI  \n17:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0It can result in bad UI  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't know it depends where it's used and how  \n17:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's pretty much a case by case decision  \n17:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0A small panel with a limited width (as far as I understand)  \n17:39\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Somebody review after me on l10n.xwiki.org ?  \n17:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0All I can suggest is to test it  \n17:40\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Yes, I will, of course :-)  \n17:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is no real official systematic review before a release no but there will probably be bug report or new contribution if your translation does not fit well  \n17:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and it depends a lot on the language  \n17:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0OK, I'll test, and unless it's very weird, I'll submit it to l10n.xwiki.org  \n17:41\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0French is used a lot but not always in the latest version  \n17:41\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0Thank you very much for the support  \n17:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0thanks you for the contribution :)  \n17:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I got a strange bug concerning IE9, Bootstrap, and the WYSIWYG editor: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10661  \n17:46\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0mflorea: maybe you have a clue?
