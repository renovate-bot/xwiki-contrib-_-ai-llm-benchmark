Then I'll handle the selenium tests and the rest of the release.  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: I've been starting some profiling this morning since I was surprised by the # of calls to ECM.lookup().

This can be done after the release though.  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: we need an ETA for the release.

It's nice to enforce that rule though since it's a common mistake.  \n12:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Anyway, I added PTR#asProvider() and PTR#asRequirer() and made PTR<P, R> extend TR instead of TR<R> and now it works.  \n12:30\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0^lol anyone not following the conversation would be all O\\_o  \n12:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0h\u00e9h\u00e9  \n12:30\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0but I have a PTR<R,P> extends TR<R> which works \u00a0nicely ;)  \n12:31\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i am, thank you ;)  \n12:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0really? The test works?  \n12:31\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0yes  \n12:31\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0and the anti-test fails  \n12:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think I like this design better actually. It allowed me to remove TR#runIn(PTR)  \n12:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0so now TR only has one runIn() function.  \n12:32\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I have 2 runIn in TR but this is nice  \n12:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the only line which changed in the test is:  \n12:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0TransactionRunnable<MyInterfaceWithDataA1> tr2WithNewCapabilities = tr2.runIn(tr1.asProvider());  \n12:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If you want to pastebin your patch, I'll take a look.  \n12:35\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Another thing I want to get to today is (IMO) a TR should not be rollback()'d unless it has been preRun() and that is not always true currently.  \n12:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Actually (IMO) rollback only if run() was called and complete() only if preRun() was called.  \n12:38\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0http://xwiki.pastebin.com/hbDz6uzS  \n12:38\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I have to go for lunch, I be back in about half an hour  \n12:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ok  \n12:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0a haha  \n12:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0public <U extends T> TransactionRunnable<U> runIn(final ProvidingTransactionRunnable<? extends T, U> parent)  \n12:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That makes it work but if <? extends T> then it's being used as a regular TR and not as a PTR.  \n12:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm now I'm confused myself. That looks like it should be an assertion loop.  \n12:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0oh, nope  \n12:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think I need another test then.  \n12:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0TR<B> should be able to run inside of PTR<?, C extends B> where ? is unbounded.  \n12:45\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0I do not agrre  \n12:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It doesn't matter what the PTR requires when our TR is running inside of it.  \n12:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0We should only see it as what it provides.  \n12:46\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0all context should have the same origin  \n12:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Go ahead and have lunch, I'll commit the patch I have and we can talk about changing it later, sound good?  \n12:46\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0what we try is to ensure context has mature enougth  \n12:46\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0else, it is impossible to make the TR1-TR2-TR3 works properly  \n12:47\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0since TR2 do not care about TR1 but the startable context  \n12:48\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so ensuring ? extends T ensure that TR2 gots what it require  \n12:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that function says: \u00a0runIn(PTR<X extends T, Y extends T>) if both X and Y extend T then the PTR isn't being used.  \n12:49\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0you have 2 cases: either you have a X extends T and return an X \u00a0or you have X extends T and an Y extends X and you return an Y  \n12:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0IDK, I have to look at it more carefully to understand why that test passes. AFAICT it shouldn't.  \n12:50\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0while you are a simple TR yourself running in a PTR  \n12:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0TR<ComplexDBRunnable> should runIn() a PTR<DBRunnable, ComplexDBRunnable>  \n12:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Thus the PTR requires a (simple) DBRunnable and provides a ComplexDBRunnable  \n12:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But if Complex extends Simple then runIn(final ProvidingTransactionRunnable<? extends T <-- that is false.  \n12:56\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I just added another test, I believe this will fail with your implementation.  \n12:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://xwiki.pastebin.com/BR3dRE7g  \n12:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But it is valid because TR3 only requires what TR1 provides, TR2 is entirely extranious.  \n12:57\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You'll have to remove the '.asProvider()' to use it.  \n13:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0sdumitriu: i want to change the style for lists in a way that page content uses different list-style-position and different margins. unfortunately, if i change .main ol, .main ul {... it messes with some of the other page elements (like the tab bar at the bottom that includes attachments, info and so forth). do you have suggestion what to add to my skin to use it just for content?  \n13:12\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0There's #xwikicontent  \n13:12\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:12\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:12\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n13:13\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0using #xwikicontent.main ol{... doesn't work..., it makes the content look like nothing happend  \n13:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0ah, deleting the .main does the trick  \n13:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0stupid me ;)  \n13:15\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0thanks a bunch!  \n13:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:29\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:53\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:56\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0can you place velocity code (mainly a querey) inside of a text area of a completely different object. \u00a0For example I have data that is set through a DBList, and I am trying to retrive that data \u00a0in another object. \u00a0The data structure is a Class of Person, has a dblist type of \"works for\". \u00a0I then have company class, with a text area property and I wanted to write the query for all the people  \n13:56\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0that work at the company  \n13:57\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0The reason I wanted to put it in a text area, was so that I could potientally call that property on another page, without writing the query again  \n14:06\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cjdelisle, sdumitriu : can you recomment me a graphical text editor ? something similar to notepad++  \n14:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0What for?  \n14:09\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Gnome, KDE?  \n14:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Gnome  \n14:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0sburjan: gedit  \n14:32\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n14:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0it has tabs across the top, syntax highlighting, converts tab key to a specified number of spaces.  \n14:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I use it for all coding.  \n14:43\u00a0<venkatna>\u00a0has quit  \n14:44\u00a0<venkatna>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<venkatna>\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n14:51\u00a0<newbie>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:51\u00a0<newbie>\u00a0is now known as <Guest25347>  \n14:52\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:54\u00a0<mbryant>\u00a0has quit  \n15:05\u00a0<cjdelisle>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i got an image which i want to put left to the text so the text flows on the right. problem is, the text is not just one paragraph, it's actually an unordered list  \n15:08\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0suggestions on how to achieve this? already set vertical-align and container macro won't let me change the column size to about the image width  \n15:08\u00a0<user\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: suggestion: \"Tested\" as a column name doesn't show if the test was ok or not.

 \n18:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0In my implementation I didn't like the fact that everything revolved around the ptr which IMO serves an edge use case  \n18:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Also there was the point about not having everything extend TR  \n18:40\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0not sure to agree on the edge use case, since having a context is mostly useful  \n18:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Oh, every TR will have a context according to my latest patch.  \n18:41\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0without PTR, no context  \n18:41\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0so PTR is not edge  \n18:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Indeed it's not so much of an edge use case since StartableTR extends PTR  \n18:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But I don't see people declaring or explicitly extending PTRs very often.  \n18:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I expect it will be more of a background thing.  \n18:43\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0ProvidingTransactionRunnable<Object, T> does not look good to me  \n18:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<+Denis>\u00a0this means startable could be runIn any other TR ?
