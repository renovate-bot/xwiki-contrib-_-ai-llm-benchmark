I sent a GSoC idea proposal a few days ago but the mentor is the xwiki CEO so I think I have small chances to get a response. So I am thinking about proposing myself for another project.  \n08:29\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:) you should push for the project you like  \n08:30\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0mflorea, I want to know about the Wiki Browser project.  \n08:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0Ludovic is busy, but will answer evetually  \n08:30\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, what do you want to know  \n08:31\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0You mention lots of ideas there but I don't think I understand them all. For example wiki browser is supposed to be installed and written in java or a web app?  \n08:31\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has quit  \n08:32\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the wiki browser must be build on top of XWiki, so definitely on the web  \n08:32\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0i.e. the user will browse the wiki from the wiki  \n08:32\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0mflorea, then it will need lots of ajax and ajax listeners which will have to be more about back end.  \n08:33\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0mflorea, the idea is to create the UI or to create it all?  \n08:33\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0For example deleting a file will need to connect the database which is simple but also easily screwable.  \n08:33\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0most of the back-end is there, in XWiki APIs, you just have to write the front end, indeed using lots of AJAX  \n08:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there is already API to delete/rename/create/etc/ wiki pages and same for any other wiki entity  \n08:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0you just have to call it  \n08:34\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0mflorea, I am cool with ajax.  \n08:34\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0great then  \n08:35\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0mflorea, cool then it will be simple.  \n08:35\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0mflorea, is a framework predefined? Like jquery or html5?  \n08:35\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0well :) you'll still have to learn the XWiki API and understand the relation between wiki entities, like pages, classes, objects, attachments, etc.  \n08:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0we use Prototype.js  \n08:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so you'll have to use it  \n08:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but if you know JS then it won't be a problem  \n08:36\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0mflorea, ok I will study it. prototype.js includes drag and drop or am I supposed to use the browser (if any) features about it.  \n08:36\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0as for HTML5, we're not there yet, so plain HTML for now  \n08:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0re drag&drop, you have Scriptaculous which is build on top of Prototype.js  \n08:37\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0http://script.aculo.us/  \n08:38\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0cool then I am your guy. I will start writing a new GSoC proposal. I am very good with HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX and I am good at UI design.  \n08:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0great  \n08:39\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I'm looking forward  \n08:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0for the UI design, you can ping Caty, the other mentor for this projects, which handles the UI/UX for XWiki  \n08:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0she can give you great advices  \n08:40\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0her nick is valica right?  \n08:40\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n08:41\u00a0<faryshta>\u00a0ok if I see her online I will ask her about it.  \n08:41\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:55\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvelo: good morning  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think you broke platform yesterday  \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/1683/  \n10:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:06\u00a0<CIA-120>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r007e5d2\u000f https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/007e5d2417871839ff49be577a9f9ee3a7ab559e \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/doc/merge/MergeUtils.java :\u000f Fix checkstyle - http://git.io/JweB6Q  \n11:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:20\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:50\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n11:52\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:59\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n11:59\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:07\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:24\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has quit  \n12:26\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:29\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0hi vmassol :)  \n12:31\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0need some help!  \n12:31\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0I cloned xwiki-enterprise and i did a build, i mean mvn install  \n12:32\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0build was successfull  \n12:33\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0but, I am stuck there... when I used the war file and put it in tomcat, I am getting error saying \"cannot create DBCP pool\"  \n13:30\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:37\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has quit  \n13:50\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:53\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n13:58\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n14:07\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n14:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n14:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:01\u00a0<DrLou\\_>\u00a0is now known as <DrLou>  \n15:41\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n15:42\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:13\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:26\u00a0<florinciu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:27\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n17:29\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:42\u00a0<npm>\u00a0how can I get XE3.5 to accept old-style /xwiki/bin/view/ links perhaps rewriting to new-style /bin/view or as i've setup ( http://trainspodder.com --> http://trainspodder.com/xwiki/ )  \n19:43\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:44\u00a0<npm>\u00a0(context: this is hosted using jelastic cloud: http://lists.xwiki.org/pipermail/devs/2012-March/050044.html )  \n19:46\u00a0<npm>\u00a0hmm that's weird the 'www'-less form was just working... now http://www.trainspodder.com/ works as expected  \n19:50\u00a0<npm>\u00a0anybody know why there's a browser-dependency in handing http://trainspodder.com and \"staying\" on that domain rather than having xwiki interpret it as the hosting service domain  \n19:52\u00a0<npm>\u00a0fyi issue i'm seeing on xwiki-side is very similar to http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XEM-213  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:17\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:19\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n21:12\u00a0<th3flyboy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:13\u00a0<th3flyboy>\u00a0Hello everyone, I'm currently considering working on XWiki for GSOC, and I wanted to know if my idea is feasible or not.
