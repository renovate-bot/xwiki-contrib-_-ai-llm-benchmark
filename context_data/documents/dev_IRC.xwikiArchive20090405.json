Can you have a look, please?  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 21:54): arunreddy: Ok, great  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 21:54): ok  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 21:55): thanks  \nanamariastoica - (05/04/2009 21:56): sdumitriu, I don't mind giving it back to arunreddy   \narunreddy - (05/04/2009 21:56): sdumitriu : I will start tommorow, and will ask you in case of any doubts.  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 21:56): anamariastoica: That's ok, ladies got to choose first  \narunreddy - (05/04/2009 21:57): yes ladies first. :)  \nanamariastoica - (05/04/2009 21:57): :) ok thanks  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 21:57): arunreddy: Ok, ping me tomorrow if you need help  \narunreddy - (05/04/2009 21:58): Sure. leaving now. Bbye   \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 21:58): Good night, arunreddy  \narunreddy - (05/04/2009 21:58): sdumitriu : Good night :)  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 21:59): tachirei: There's a problem with a .csproj file. The patch is far too long. I think VS messed-up the xml.  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:00): :(  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:00): Ideally the patch should contain only your code  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:00): ok. is there anything I can do?  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:01): I'll search for a workaround tomorow. Basically it's not your fault, it's VS that does something wrong.   \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:02): Hehe  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:02): I need to find a solution because it's hard to check your code.  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:03): at 800$ per user, I guess it should know how process a xml file :|  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:03): :))  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:03): not funny  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:03): Yes, funny  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:04): :)  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:04): :P  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:05): I don't think it' very bad.. basically the xml description for my class is before some classes of yours.. and descriptions for your code is deeper in .csproj xml file.. right?  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:05): or.. there is more?  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:05): :-?  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:06): it's hard to find your code among those xml lines  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:06): :-|  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:06): yes... but you can surely see my .cs files :D  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:11): we currently write the maven .pom files by hand. I don't think we need to do that for msbuild. Surely not just for the current reason. Anyway i'll digg into it.  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:11): ok. thanks  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:12): saw, your code. The extension method looks good. You'll need to create a unit test for it.  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:12): that should be interesting  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:13): sdumitriu, are you familiar with extention methods?  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:15): I don't know what you're talking about  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:16): OK. You basically have a class in the framework or in a third party library. And you need an extra method in that class whout extending it and refactoring your code.  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:16): Oh, I understand  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:17): You can actually do that at runtime.  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:17): No, I haven't used C# in over 4 years  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:17): the issue in this case is: How do you unit test, since the unit(the class) it's not yours?  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:18): You you just create a testcase for the method?  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:19): Yes, there's no dependency between the test class and the tested class  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:19): So you can test anything you like  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:19): The question is, does the compiler see the new method?  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:20): yes :)  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:20): yes  \nsdumitriu - (05/04/2009 22:20): So go for it  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:22): The compiler doesn't compile it into a diffrent class. It's just syntactic sugar. The extra methods are inserted at runtime afaik.  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:24): florinciu: is there any 'extension property'? It would be nice if I can replace xmlDoc.InnerXml property calls with xmlDoc.IndendedXml property ... and not with xmlDoc.GetIndendedXml() method ... even if in both cases (property or not) behind is still a method ...  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:29): no, there is no such thing as extension properties and probably there will never be. It potentially involves private fields and that rises many problems if dealed at runtime.   \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:30): i preffer properties too, but it's not possible to use them in your case.  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:31): :-|  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:31): ok  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:47): florinciu: where should I create unit tests for XOffice? In TestXWikiLib project?  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:49): Yes, when you are testing classes in the XWikiLib project.  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:50): yes.. in my case the unit test is for a class/method from XWikiLib  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:51): so if it's a class in XWord then it should go in a separate assembly generated by TestXWord  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:51): I understand  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:51): 10x  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:53): florinciu: one more question: when I want to add a test (in TestXWikiLib project) I have 3 options: \"Ordered Test\", \"Unit Test\", and \"Unit Test Wizard\" ... should I go for \"Unit Test\" :?  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:54): no  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 22:55): that's for MS unit testing  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 22:57): ok  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 23:42): florinciu: I have attached a new version of the patch for XOFFICE-62 (added NUnit test)  \nflorinciu - (05/04/2009 23:44): ok, thanks. I'll review & apply tomorow.  \ntachirei - (05/04/2009 23:44): great  \n\n"}
