One is for test suites, where connections to the database are made from one JVM context, immediately followed by another context. The other use is for applications where it is not easy to configure the environment to shutdown the database. Examples reported by users include web application servers, where the closing of the last connection coincides with the web app being shut down.  \n10:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0To my credit, when I committed that I had no idea why that was actually happening, I thought HSQL was leaving a dangling lock.  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: hmm actually I'm not sure if stopping the db is going to work fine\u2026.  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since we're stopping the java process already  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should stop the DB too  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I'll still force it to eb sure and we'll see if it helps  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm actually it's not easy to do since it has to be done on the server side\u2026. so we do need to introduce an API. I'm going to introduce it in the HibernateStore class while waiting for a more generic one, ok?  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(that way I can also be shared with teh packager plugin)  \n10:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*nod\\*  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we alreayd have a shutdownHibernate btw  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wonder if that shutdown the DB too, prolly not  \n10:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: look at my suggestion above  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: link?  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I remember looking at it 5 yeasr ago but I don't remember the details)  \n10:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/dbproperties-chapt.html#conn\\_props-sect  \n10:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0check the 12.8.

In 1.8.0, a connection property, shutdown=true, can be specified on the first connection to the database (the connection that opens the database) to force a shutdown when the last connection closes.  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so they changed it  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now we need to be sure it's safe to have shutdown=true in production  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it looks safe though  \n10:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Is there a way to prove that the process has stopped?  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: our script provies it  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's blocking  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0stop\\_xwiki.sh  \n10:49\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If that was true then I wouldn't be getting dangling locks would I?  \n10:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Or are they lasting because HSQL is shutdown \"wrong\"?  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0see my question above  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at 10:39  \n10:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hehe my clock isn't even accurate for eastern time ;)  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjdelisle: I woul dhave expected hsqldb to have a shutdown hook to close itself  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but they say in the doc: \"From version 1.7.2, in-process databases are no longer closed when the last connection to the database is explicitly closed via JDBC, a SHUTDOWN is required\"  \n10:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so maybe it's not closed properly  \n10:52\u00a0<+evalica>\u00a0sburjan: can you test {{include document=\"Main.Dashboard\"/}} on a space WebHome - it's not working for the 2.1 M2 nor 2.1 RC1.
