 \nmflorea - (12:01): jvelociter: only for ID literals  \njvelociter - (12:02): mflorea to be honest I'm not so convinced we should go that far. In my opinion the case where multiple XWiki portlets are displayed on the same page is marginal, and I'm not even sure we should support it  \nlucaa - (12:03): guys, wdyt about \u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-756 ?  \nmflorea - (12:04): jvelociter: it's not about multiple instance, it's about conflict with other portlets or the portal page itself. Take for instance the id of the wiki editor text area: 'content' it needs to be namespaced, so any JS that references it must be updated  \nlucaa - (12:04): I'm especially interested in the macro name and parameters  \njvelociter - (12:04): mflorea: OK, then makes sense  \nmflorea - (12:04): same with all IDs used by XWIki  \nsburjan - (12:04): I think we will have to make the FoxWiki addon compatible with latest FF versions too .. in future  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 12:04  \njvelociter - (12:05): (we should not have too much IDs literals in JS anyway I think - if you have it's usually not a very good sign for the code ;) )  \nmflorea - (12:05): yep, you should have it only in the main page, not in \\*.js files  \nmflorea - (12:05): maybe also in some specific js extensions  \njvelociter - (12:06): yes, but then maybe it would be best to refactor not to use IDs rather than use the ID funcituon  \nmflorea - (12:08): I'm not sure you can leave without IDs at all. Reducing their number is good IMO, but my approach so far was to change as little as possible the platform  \njvelociter - (12:09): we need to decide on a case by case, yes. But the lesser the better  \nmflorea - (12:09): yep, have to go now, be back in 1h  \nmflorea left at 12:10 (Quit: Leaving.  \njstoldt - (12:17): i'm giving up  \njstoldt - (12:17): making the class editor localizable is a lot more work than i anticipated  \njstoldt - (12:18): sorry guys but i'll leave it to you then  \nrrodriguez left at 12:19 (Quit: rrodriguez  \nabusenius left at 12:20 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \ntmortagne left at 12:22 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 12:22  \nsdumitriu - (12:23): jstoldt: Need a hint?  \njstoldt - (12:24): well, it's not really about getting a hint. the problem is that you currently use GetPrettyName(), so basically any displayed class has a number of properties with \"subproperties\" attached  \njstoldt - (12:24): all of these have a prettyname which is hardcoded at this time  \njstoldt - (12:25): in order to make that localizable we'd either have to change the SetPrettyName calls for each and every of those classes to act multilanguage like  \njstoldt - (12:25): and i don't know if that would be possible if we want to change the language on the fly  \nsdumitriu - (12:25): No  \nsdumitriu - (12:25): It's much simpler than that  \nsdumitriu - (12:26): Let me find a link  \njstoldt - (12:26): alternatively we'd have to rip out the entire stuff (because it'd get unused) and then just call the proper strings upon creation of the page  \njstoldt - (12:26): the latter part of that solution is rather quickly done if i had a list of strings to display  \nsburjan - (12:26): sdumitriu: I was wondering about the attachments tab, and the Firefox extension to edit attachments.
