If I want to have unique dashboard views for each space how can I split them out? I seem to be unable to get them setup any way except for with all dashboards pointing to one configuration  \n00:03\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0ahh - apparently just can't edit the main page dashboard - all others can be edited individually  \n00:03\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0or dashboard  \n00:04\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0Iaks: there is a default template dashboard when you create a space  \n00:04\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0basically you have 2 options: create a space with a blank WebHome, or create a space using a pre-defined template for the space WebHome  \n00:04\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0right - what I am running into is that when I try to customize how the 'dashboard' or 'main' space looks when I first the load the space  \n00:05\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0and editing either of those changes the template for all other spaces  \n00:05\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes  \n00:05\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0you have to customize the dashboard for each space individually  \n00:06\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0or modify the template which is used when creating a new space  \n00:06\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0don't know if this answers your question  \n00:07\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0I think that part is clear to me. My question then is can you edit the webhome view for 'dashboard' or 'main' without effecting all other spaces?  \n00:08\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0well each space has its own dashboard, so you should be able to edit the dashboard of a space without affecting the otherdashboards  \n00:10\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0hrm - 'dashboard' and 'main' seem to be linked for me =( If I could hide one it would work fine, they are just redundant at this stage of my configuration  \n00:10\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0not sure what do you mean by 'dashboard' and 'main'  \n00:11\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0I installed the default .xar config file which configures a bunch of spaces. Two of them are titled 'Dashboard' and 'Main'  \n00:11\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0They seem to lead to the same data  \n00:12\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0but both spaces contain macros and a few other docs that break things when I delete them or change the view permissions  \n00:12\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0Main is basically the Main space, when you go to you wiki .. is the /xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome of your wiki  \n00:12\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0\\*your  \n00:13\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0and Main/WebHome uses the dashboard from Dashboard space  \n00:13\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0it includes it  \n00:13\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0right - that makes sense. for some reason I have a space called dashboard as well  \n00:13\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0so deleting the Dashboard space will remove your dashboard from Main too  \n00:14\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0right - do I need to have both visible to users, though?  \n00:14\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0the dashboard space seems like it is really just storing configuration files and shouldn't be an exposed view  \n00:14\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0you mean setting rights on Dashboard space to make it disappear from the spaces list ?  \n00:15\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0I tried that, but then users can't load the dashboard scripts  \n00:15\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes  \n00:15\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0we have a feature which is about excluding technical spaces  \n00:15\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0not sure Dashboard is considered technical, but yes, you areright, having a dashboard space might be confusing for end users  \n00:16\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0at least having it visible in the spaces macro which displays all spaces  \n00:16\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0Thank you for disentangling my confusing description  \n00:16\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0yes -that is exactly what I'm running into  \n00:16\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0Spaces macro lists two items that I can't delete and both show the identical view/data  \n00:17\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0well they are not 100% identical. Basically Main=Dashboard + some text  \n00:17\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0Right - I did delete the welcome text =)  \n00:18\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but if you take it like this, Sandbox should also be hidden, because I don;t think you use it  \n00:18\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0=) yep, that one is susceptible to the rights trick to hide it  \n00:18\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0doesn't break anything else  \n00:19\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0\\*so far\\*  \n00:20\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has quit  \n00:21\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0also Panels doesn't need to be there  \n00:21\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0Xwiki either, because XWiki is crucial if you want to have your wiki working  \n00:21\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0so for the moment, maybe you should just stop using the spaces macro in the dashboard, and manually list the spaces you want  \n00:22\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0that sounds like a good work around - I had removed those last two by removing the view right on them for non-admins  \n00:22\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0I don't really need to be able to dynamically add spaces so this could be fine  \n00:23\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0because existing spacesw have alreadya purpose, listing them doesn't do any good if you want your users to see only what you want them to see  \n00:23\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0ColorThemes is also useless for your users  \n00:24\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0in the future some of these spaces will be hidden by default because they contain code which is used by other stuff  \n00:24\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0yep - I basically went down the list of all spaces and prohibited view access, but you are right that a better solution is to build the list manually instead  \n00:25\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0seems you wanna build a strict environment for your users :)  \n00:27\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0haha - corporate intranets... what can I say  \n00:29\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n00:31\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yeah, safest way is to drop the spaces macro  \n00:31\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0the default dashboard you see is usually for starting with xwiki, this is why it has so many things exposed  \n01:04\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0Haha - well the downside to hiding all those spaces via the rights admin panel is that lots of stuff is boinked now! =( wyswyg doesn't exist, and i'm sure other things too  \n01:06\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0hiding them using rights is not the right way for sure  \n01:07\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0Stick with my solution, or if you really want to do it another way, try modifying the spaces macro code :)  \n01:08\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0haha yep - I was going to your solution, but had already messed with things =)  \n01:08\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0hrm - I need a hard reset option =)  \n01:09\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0rollback the history of pages you modified, undelete pages,etc  \n01:09\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0or a hard reset might be re-importing the XAR. this would undone everything ...  \n01:09\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0not sure about the rights ..  \n01:10\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0just did that, but the access permissions don't seem to have changed  \n01:11\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0need to uncheck 'import as backup package' maybe  \n01:11\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes, try that  \n01:12\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0haha - access not allowed to /view/Main  \n01:12\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0lol  \n01:13\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I guess you'll have to start over with your xwiki  \n01:13\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0:D  \n01:13\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0well you might enable superadmin and revive it  \n01:13\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0but that might be harder than to start from scratch.. depends how far you've gone  \n01:13\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0haha yep - I'd rahter just wipe and start over  \n01:15\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0I guess I just drop the entire db table and that wipes everything?  \n01:15\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0yes  \n01:15\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0and re-create the database and grant privileges  \n01:15\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0then xwiki will create its schema upon start  \n01:15\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0ahh subtlety  \n01:16\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0anyway, if you want to use xwiki in production, it is recommended you perform regulat backups of the db  \n01:16\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I guess this should apply everywhere :)  \n01:16\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0definitely - going to worry about getting a working setup first though =)  \n01:24\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0ahhh - fresh and clean  \n01:47\u00a0<Iaks>\u00a0has quit  \n04:21\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has quit  \n04:26\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n04:35\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has quit  \n06:01\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has quit  \n06:04\u00a0<ssavi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n09:10\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:57\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: hi  \n11:01\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0vmassol1: hi  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0AndreasJonsson: I think you broke the build :)  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0for the security modue  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0try removing the artifacts in your local repo and try rebuilding you should get this;  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project xwiki-platform-security-bridge: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-security-bridge:jar:4.0-SNAPSHOT: Could not find artifact org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-security-api:jar:tests:4.0-SNAPSHOT in xwiki-snapshots (http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots) -> [Help 1]  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n11:02\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0Maybe the class includes in the pom were significant after all. :)  \n11:03\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0I'll fix it.  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thx  \n11:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:31\u00a0<+AndreasJonsson>\u00a0vmassol: I think that the problem was there even before my commit. \u00a0xwiki-platform-security-bridge dependes on the test-jar of xwiki-platform-security-api, and snapshot releases of test jars are not available from the maven repository.  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0can you fix it?
