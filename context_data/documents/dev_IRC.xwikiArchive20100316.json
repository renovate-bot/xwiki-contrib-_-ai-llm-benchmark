Can it be installed on XE?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:11): It looks like there are also some jars which need to be installed, I would download xwatch and copy out any jars which are not in XE already.  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:13): Hmm, looks like it would have to be compiled as the last release was for platform 1.5 \u00a0http://watch.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Installation#HXWiki20Watch20over20an20existing20wiki  \nsdumitriu - (00:15): lucaa knows best  \nsdumitriu - (00:16): Watch needs its own web.xml because it has some custom servlets  \nlucaa - (00:16): hi LadySerena  \nlucaa - (00:16): watch is a bunch of jars (2), some servlet added in the web.xml and a .xar you impoty  \nlucaa - (00:16): import  \nlucaa - (00:17): I assume you'd want to install it on a modern xwiki, for which the solution is: http://watch.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Installation#HBuilding20and20installing20an20XWiki20Watch20Snapshot20over20an20existing20XWiki20Enterprise  \nlucaa - (00:20): CalebJamesDeLisl: that's an old web.xml, it's not watch's own, it's just a merge of enterprise with watch. Quite outdated (my guess is something like 1.5)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (00:21): I see, thanks.  \nLadySerena - (00:50): you know, with JQuery, you select what you want in your installation, where you wanna put it on your server, and even the color theme and upload images you want it to use ...... and their server builds a package just for your specified configuration  \nLadySerena - (00:50): I know it'd be difficult, but it'd be cool to build something like that for XWiki.  \nLadySerena - (00:51): so with one download, someone could have XEM + Chronopolys + Watch + Workspaces preconfigured for ShortURLs and all they'd have to do is deploy it  \nLadySerena - (00:52): makes life easier for admins \u00a0:D  \nmpavel left #xwiki at 00:59  \nanamarias left at 01:00 (Quit: anamarias  \nsavi joined #xwiki at 01:47  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 01:50  \njvelociter left at 01:55 (Quit: jvelociter  \njvelociter joined #xwiki at 02:20  \nsdumitriu left at 02:32 (Read error: Operation timed out  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 02:35  \nsavi left at 02:54 (Quit: savi  \nsdumitriu left at 03:06 (Ping timeout: 256 seconds  \njvelociter left at 04:31 (Quit: jvelociter  \nnickless left at 05:53 (Ping timeout: 252 seconds  \nDenis left at 06:01 (Read error: Connection reset by peer  \nDenis joined #xwiki at 06:09  \nfipblizip joined #xwiki at 06:26  \nfipblizip left at 06:27 (Client Quit  \nmflorea joined #xwiki at 07:21  \nkibahop joined #xwiki at 07:29  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 07:35  \nbblfish left at 07:36 (Ping timeout: 260 seconds  \nbblfish joined #xwiki at 07:41  \nheadache joined #xwiki at 08:17  \nheadache - (08:17): hello  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:21): Hi headache  \nheadache - (08:25): hi CalebJamesDeLisl  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 08:42  \nanamarias left at 08:43 (Client Quit  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:46): vmassol: I'd like to resurrect Alex's proposal for a secret auth token to prevent CSRF. My imagined implementation would require components to have access to the user, what do you think of adding an EntityReference (for the user document) to the ExecutionContext?  \nvmassol - (08:48): CalebJamesDeLisl: I think you should use the XWikiContext for now till we redesign the authentication module. For example I wouldn't put an EntityReference directly in the EC in the new architecture but instead probably a User object which would have a getReference()  \nvmassol - (08:48): (but I haven't thought about the new architecture for authentication and authorization so I don't really know)  \nvmassol - (08:48): what you can do though  \nvmassol - (08:49): is work on Context/XWikiContext so that you have a getuser api that returns an EntityReference  \nvmassol - (08:49): (instead of a string)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:49): I like the EntityReference because it might point to anything in the DB which signifies the user.  \nvmassol - (08:49): it's a weak concept  \nvmassol - (08:50): too weak for a proper design IMO  \nvmassol - (08:50): it's like using a string for a document refernce  \nvmassol - (08:50): this is too weak  \nvmassol - (08:50): but it's ok for the old api  \nvmassol - (08:50): I just wouldn't like the new api to have to change too quickly  \nvmassol - (08:50): since changing an api is a nightmare  \nvmassol - (08:51): (EC is new api)  \nvmassol - (08:51): (Context/XWikiContext is old api)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (08:51): EC is api?

Here is what I am trying to achieve:  \nglerouge - (18:59): something like  \nplunden - (18:59): #set($user = $xwiki.getDocument('XWiki.PicaPau').getObject('XWiki.XWikiUsers'))  \nplunden - (18:59): $doc.addObject($user)  \nplunden - (18:59): #set($userClass = $user.xWikiClass)  \nplunden - (18:59): #foreach($prop in $userClass.properties)  \nplunden - (18:59): \u00a0\u00a0; $prop.prettyName  \nplunden - (18:59): \u00a0\u00a0: $doc.display($prop.getName())  \nplunden - (18:59): #end  \nplunden - (19:00): Does it make sense? :-)  \nvmassol - (19:01): I have no idea why we don't have an api to add existing objects to a document in our public API....  \nglerouge - (19:01): try with  \nglerouge - (19:01): actually I don't know  \nvmassol - (19:01): sdumitriu: any idea why we miss that?  \nvmassol - (19:01): (we do have apis in the privileged api)  \nsdumitriu - (19:02): vmassol: Why would we need that?  \nsdumitriu - (19:02): We don't have floating objects  \nsdumitriu - (19:02): An object should always belong to a document  \nvmassol - (19:02): for example you can get an exsiting object, clone it and add it  \nvmassol - (19:03): sdumitriu: well we do have lots of apis in XWikiDocument for adding BaseObject  \nvmassol - (19:03): so I guess there's a reason  \nvmassol - (19:03): and yes you can create object and associate them with a document  \nvmassol - (19:03): and then add them to a document  \nvmassol - (19:04): there are cases where it's handy I guess  \nplunden - (19:04): Yeah, that I'm trying to achieve. Adding an object to current page so that I can show its fields.  \nplunden - (19:05): s/page/document/  \nplunden - (19:05): an existing object, I might add  \nvmassol - (19:06): an alternative would be copy/renameObject methods I guess  \nvmassol - (19:06): not rename  \nvmassol - (19:06): just copy  \nvmassol - (19:06): but it may or may not fill all use cases  \nvmassol - (19:07): anyway just trying to answer to plunden  \nsavi left at 19:07 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nglerouge left at 19:07 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (19:07): plunden: btw why do you need to copy the object?  \nsavi joined #xwiki at 19:12  \nplunden - (19:12): I am creating an app for managing boards. There is a class HB.BoardMember. They are each associated with an XWiki user. I am trying to show board member data together with their associated user data.  \njvdrean left at 19:13 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol - (19:13): plunden: yes but why are you trying to copy objects from one document to another?  \nplunden - (19:13): Like having HB.PicaPau to show the user data from XWiki.PicaPau and the membership data.  \nvmassol - (19:14): in your example above you're trying to copy a XWikiUsers object from $xwiki.getDocument('XWiki.PicaPau') to $doc  \nvmassol - (19:14): and I don't understand why you need to copy it  \nplunden - (19:15): To show the user&member data together and update the user&member data together.  \nvmassol - (19:15): plunden: doesn it work if you do: $xwiki.getDocument('XWiki.PicaPau').display(\u2026) instead?  \nvmassol - (19:16): (it should work in view mode, not sure in inline mode though)  \nplunden - (19:16): Ah, let me try.  \nvmassol - (19:17): in any case it sounds very wrong to me to copy object just to display them  \nvmassol - (19:17): (display and/or edit)  \nvmassol - (19:17): you'll get duplicated objects (in 2 locations)  \nplunden - (19:18): So they are not references to the same object?  \nvmassol - (19:18): no  \nvmassol - (19:18): each object is associated with one document  \nvmassol - (19:18): objects don't exist without documents as sergiu said  \nplunden - (19:19): Yeah, viewing works now.  \nsavi left at 19:20 (Ping timeout: 245 seconds  \nplunden - (19:20): Editing not so. ;-)  \nplunden - (19:21): Or the user data does not get updated, member data does.  \nvmassol - (19:21): ok\u2026 I don't know how to do that, maybe someone else knows here  \nplunden - (19:23): I think that is enough for me.  \nplunden - (19:24): Thanks for infos.  \nsavi joined #xwiki at 19:25  \nfipblizip joined #xwiki at 19:40  \nplunden left #xwiki at 19:40  \narkub left at 19:44 (Quit: Leaving  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 19:46  \nmpavel left at 19:53 (Quit: Leaving.  \njvdrean left at 20:00 (Quit: Leaving.  \nplunden joined #xwiki at 20:02  \nkkrasika left at 20:07 (Quit: When two people dream the same dream, it ceases to be an illusion.
