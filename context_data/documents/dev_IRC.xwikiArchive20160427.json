 \n15:25\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0hummmm  \n15:25\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0\u00a0Not for production.  \n15:26\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0how should I upgrade from 7.0.1 to 8.0 ?  \n15:26\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0is it a special procedure ?  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0google!  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0have you tried googling for:  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"xwiki upgrade\"  \n15:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n15:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:38\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0[15:23] <+ClemensR> I guess ${doc.space} expands to \"&parent=yourspace\"[...] but the \u00a0\"yourspace.WebHome\" is <- exactly  \n15:39\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0Should I add this special case as an example in the documentation ?  \n15:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, if you know a parent is always a page and not a space, this is not so special a case, but it seems this is less than obvious, so it probably helps to document it  \n15:41\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0it work, of course, only if you don't use the \"nested document\" functionnality  \n15:42\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0honestly, I'm not a dev' .. I have some knowledge of java, a little bit of C/C++ and that's all  \n15:42\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I had to learn some basics about JSON just to understand how it worked  \n15:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, current live table uses the doc.location=... for looking up deeper into nested pages  \n15:43\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I don't think that all your clients are fully experienced dev', and being able to just use the documented scripting of Livetable can help a lot  \n15:43\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, that is enough for a dev, and the will to learn new things, of course ;)  \n15:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yes, improving docs shouldalwatys help  \n15:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0as a side note, I still havn't been able to manage to make the \"extraParams\" : \"&yourProperty\\_class=yourSpace.yourClass\" function work  \n15:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0maybe somone with extended knowledge and understanding of how it work should add a real example  \n15:46\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0Attachments on the filesystem  \n15:46\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0where sould be located ?  \n15:47\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0by default, it's in the database if my memory is not bugged ^^  \n15:47\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0how can I be sure ?  \n15:47\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0;)  \n15:47\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0your brain seem not bugged  \n15:48\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0it is, but sometime it agree to work as intended ..  \n15:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0boubou: you have a lot about attachment FS store on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Attachments#HFilesystemAttachmentStore  \n15:50\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0about the customxproperty, in extraparams, is it using this function in livetableResults ?  \n15:50\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0#gridresultwithfilter(\"$!request.classname\" $request.collist.split(',') '' \"${extra}\" $params)  \n15:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, I see the docs for 'extraParams' 'parent=...' \u00a0is plain wrong, its a copy & paste error from the line above ...  \n15:51\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0oh yes I forgot to report this too  \n15:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0would have to read the code how the extraParams are passed through, either  \n15:51\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0yes in the parent option, it have indeed \"extraParams\" : \"&space=${doc.space}\" instead of \"&parent=${doc.space}\"  \n15:52\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0it should be fixed, but I managed to understand this by myself, as it had no sense  \n15:53\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0I was more bugged by this :  \n15:53\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0This option can also be used to view properties of classes other than the one declared in className (\"extraParams\" : \"&yourProperty\\_class=yourSpace.yourClass\"  \n15:53\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0as I couldn't understand how it work  \n15:53\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0what is this \"yourProperty\\_class\" ?  \n15:53\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0the name of your property with a \"\\_class\" at the end ?  \n15:55\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0um, this is indeed unclear. I have to admit I never used this feature ...  \n15:56\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0if you manage to make it work, I'm curious about how it work  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm looks like we need to add useSSL=false in MySQL connection URL with most recent version, just upgrade to Ubuntu 16.05 and ending up with 10 lines of warning about that when starting XWiki  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(most recent versions of MySQL I mean)  \n16:00\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0there is a bug report at mySQL for it http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=80198 \u00a0but I am not sure if they want to fix it  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the warning does seems to be here on purpose  \n16:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at least it's not a bug from technical point of view  \n16:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it sure is annoying :)  \n16:04\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0also http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=80198 seems to be more about what is in the warning than the fact of getting a warning  \n16:04\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess it does not hurt to add it, even if it is used with an older mysql server  \n16:16\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:18\u00a0<Evi>\u00a0hey guys, I have a quesion concerning the statistics module.
