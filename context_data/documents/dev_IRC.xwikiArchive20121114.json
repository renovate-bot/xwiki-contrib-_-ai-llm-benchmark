When I try to register a new user catalina.out.log writes this http://pastebin.com/F65cjvhc As far as I can tell there is something wrong with DB connection, maybe DB driver. Any thoughts?

 \n10:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's ALREADY there  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's why we have the commit tab  \n10:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0what is already there?  \n10:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0ah, you mean you`ve used the same jira issue for both platform and enterprise?  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n10:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0and it shows in the commit tab both repos  \n10:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n10:25\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0there are so many times \u2026. when that tab didn't worked and I had to search the logs and waist to much time \u2026  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it just works  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0all the time  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it iddn't before when we were using the older way of doing it  \n10:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I changed to the DVCS plugin it's been working all the time  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at least I've never seen anyone mentioning it's not working and it has alwasy worked for me since then  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case there's certainly no practice to put a commit rev in jira  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(manually I mean)  \n10:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0make a proposal if you think that's worth it and we can vote on it  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry evalica, i don't have time to show you hwo to get your history but it's not lost, don't worry, it's still there  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it's counted in all our stats too  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I have to go drive to devoxx in a few seconds/minutes  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just in case you see me disconnect suddenly ;))  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(waiting for my pick up to arrive)  \n10:36\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: http://markmail.org/message/wxsqvbxka3jmmfnd Did you get to do that?  \n10:37\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:38\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: unfortunately no  \n10:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:41\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so the only backup we are using right now is hoping that the developer uses the same Jira issue for both repositories in the commit message, since we don`t have a clear practice on that. (sometimes we make 1, sometimes we make 2 issues - one for each project/repo)  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well as I said nothing is lost  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you can find it again in git  \n10:42\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0yes, it`s just a pain to dig for it, instead of using the existing tools  \n10:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's a pain  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0git is a pain  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in this regards)  \n10:43\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0so we should at least establish this as a practice when moving stuff around  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which part?  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the commit message?  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I agree about it, I just didn't remember it  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've put the info in jira for now  \n10:44\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0using the same jira issue (coresponding to the target jira project) for both source and target git repo  \n10:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(even though it should appear in the commit tab)  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: correction, you won't see both commits in the commits tab for a given jira issue  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because a jira project is mapped to git repo  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(1-1 relationship)  \n10:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0just checked  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8437?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-bitbucket-connector-plugin:bitbucket-commits-tabpanel  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry got to go  \n10:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can talk later and finish the discussion thread  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:36\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:48\u00a0<jvdrean1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:49\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n13:35\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:29\u00a0<larian>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:31\u00a0<benkertp>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:37\u00a0<larian>\u00a0has quit  \n14:39\u00a0<benkertp>\u00a0Hi all, is there a way to filter the activity stream to only show messages (Milestone 4.2)  \n14:45\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0benkertp: there is a jira for that http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-6698 and I also did a patch for it. It just needs to be reviewed and applied. Will probably happen soon, like 4.4-milestone-1, since it`s quite late to include that in 4.3  \n14:50\u00a0<benkertp>\u00a0ok, thank you - then I need to think about another solution  \n14:53\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0benkertp: you can try applying the pull request yourself.
