Lowell.  \nfipblizip - (04:38): you?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (04:39): I'm not in school right now but I took a Java class at Umass Amherst.  \nfipblizip - (04:40): I was reading that page. The application hasn't started yet. But I see most of the projects are already assigned. So I got confused...  \nfipblizip - (04:40): Was it like a cont. study class?  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (04:41): I think I remember hearing that the projects get proposed and chosen before the students so you can propose a project if you think there is something XWiki can't do without.  \nfipblizip - (04:42): I see. It makes perfect sense now. Thank you.  \nfipblizip - (04:46): Got reboot. Nice talking to you.

You mean the webid from webid.myxw... ?  \njvelociter - (13:45): yep  \nbblfish - (13:45): very nice.  \nbblfish - (13:45): hehe  \nbblfish - (13:45): I am not sure how good openid4.me deals with attribute exchange  \njvelociter - (13:45): Markus patch still needs some work to be integrated but it's pretty much working now  \nbblfish - (13:45): Do some of the properties come through?  \njvelociter - (13:46): you mean name / email ?  \nbblfish - (13:46): I don't htink email would, as that is not made public  \nbblfish - (13:46): but name, email yes  \nbblfish - (13:46): s/email/blog/  \njvelociter - (13:46): I don't think so, I had to enter my name again  \njvelociter - (13:46): though I haven't checked if it was a bug on the discovering end  \nbblfish - (13:47): ok. The trick would be to have a big more info get through. But OpenId AX is very limited. All the attributes have to fit in a URL  \nbblfish - (13:47): Are there any AX test suites?  \ntmortagne joined #xwiki at 13:47  \njvelociter - (13:47): I don't know  \nbblfish - (13:48): anyway. that is great. I think that if you have OpenId working, then foaf+ssl can use that as a base to go from  \nbblfish - (13:48): Are you going to integrate it into the core then?  \ntmortagne left at 13:48 (Client Quit  \njvelociter - (13:49): yes I'd like to  \njvelociter - (13:49): I will refactor Markus code a little then probably have a demo on myxwiki.org and propose the patch for integration in the core  \nbblfish - (13:50): ok, we should add it to webid.myxwiki.org  \nbblfish - (13:50): then at least we'll be able to login, using the openid from xwiki  \njvelociter - (13:50): definitely  \nbblfish - (13:51): also it will allow people with WebIds from other sites to login to xwiki using their profiles  \nbblfish - (13:51): Do you allow people who login externally with an openid, to prove that they have an local account?  \nbblfish - (13:52): (so they don't necessarily have to create a new account?)  \njvelociter - (13:52): in the initial patch their is a feature to attach an openid with an existing account, yes  \nbblfish - (13:52): great!  \njvelociter - (13:53): their is one behavior I'm going to change right now : the fact that one has to register with openId before being able to login with openId  \njvelociter - (13:53): I will make possible to register with open ID \"on the fly\"  \njvelociter - (13:53): I think it makes more sense  \njvelociter - (13:53): that's one of the advantage people expect from openID. not having to register  \nbblfish - (13:53): yes. I agree.  \nbblfish - (13:54): It's always annoyong to come to a stite with openid, and then have to also register and fill out all the same details again  \njvelociter - (13:54): yes that's why the more we can get from attribute exchange the better  \njvelociter - (13:55): first name / last name would be the minimum  \nbblfish - (13:55): Now there is an intersting improvement one can make to openid  \nbblfish - (13:55): When you go to the openid page, and it says in RDFa :me openid <>  \nbblfish - (13:55): then you know that the details on that page are allready there in RDFa  \nbblfish - (13:56): so you could get a lot of info there  \nbblfish - (13:56): ( But perhaps something to add for the next rev )  \nbblfish - (13:56): for example see: http://bblfish.net/  \nbblfish - (13:57): (though I have only started marking that mage up in RDFa )  \njvelociter - (13:57): ok  \njvelociter - (13:57): but how do you bring this back in the profile ?  \nbblfish - (13:58): http://pastebin.org/112487  \nbblfish - (13:58): ah, the same way we'll do it with foaf+ssl  \nbblfish - (13:58): :-)  \nbblfish - (13:59): So when I have added foaf+ssl, you'll be able to take the code to improve OpenID  \njvelociter - (13:59): cool :)  \nbblfish - (14:00): ok just edited http://pastebin.org/112488  \nbblfish - (14:00): rapper is from redland rdf library  \nbblfish - (14:01): xwiki, could soon have the most powerful distributed authentication system :-)  \njvelociter - (14:02): so one would query the openid page in a second step (separate from attaching openid)  \njvelociter - (14:02): is that it ?  \njvelociter - (14:02): hehe  \nbblfish - (14:02): I think  \nbblfish - (14:02): 1. Get OpenId  \nbblfish - (14:03): 1.1 parse the header for the openid2.provider openid.server  \nbblfish - (14:03): 1.2 also parse for any rdfa while you are at it - or for a link to an external RDF/XML file  \nbblfish - (14:03): 1.3 keep that info around  \nbblfish - (14:03): 2. do OpenId authentication song and dance  \nbblfish - (14:04): 3. If 2 succeeds, you can use the info at 1.2 (1.3) to get more info about the user  \njvelociter - (14:05): I see  \nbblfish - (14:06): But I'll need to do that myself in the WebId code. So it will be easy to cut and paste  \nbblfish - (14:06): foaf+ssl allows one to bypass 2  \nbblfish - (14:06): (though initially I'll use something equivalent to 2, to avoid having to install a ssl layer)  \nbblfish - (14:08): are you in the US jvelociter ?  \njvelociter - (14:08): nope, I'm in France  \nbblfish - (14:09): ah it's the irc server in the US  \nbblfish - (14:24): jvelociter: do you know what the problem with this page is? http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/inline/XWiki/hjs?category=profile  \nbblfish - (14:24): I get applewebdata://B9D9C167-7B9A-4DB2-AE8F-40FDE1C60C71/%7B%7Bhtml%20clean=  \njvelociter - (14:27): I'm not allowed to see it :)  \nbblfish - (14:27): I think it appears on any profile?  \nbblfish - (14:27): s/?//  \njvelociter - (14:27): I'll check mine  \njvelociter - (14:28): where do you see the issue ?  \njvelociter - (14:29): I have an issue with the display of blog field  \njvelociter - (14:29): it displays {{/html}}\" rel=\"foaf:blog\">{{html clean=\"false\" wiki=\"false\"}}  \njvelociter - (14:29): (in inline mode)  \nbblfish - (14:29): yes  \nbblfish - (14:30): in edit mode  \nbblfish - (14:32): it must be the code I am writing at http://webid.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/edit/WebId/XWikiUserProfileSheet  \nbblfish - (14:33): I wrote that there  \nbblfish - (14:33): <dd>{{html clean=false wiki=false}}<a about=\"#me\" href=\"$doc.display('blog')\" rel=\"foaf:blog\">$doc.display('blog')</a>{{/html}}</dd>  \nbblfish - (14:33): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#end  \njvelociter - (14:34): ah  \njvelociter - (14:35): in inline mode you have the $doc.display that outputs an input field  \njvelociter - (14:35): so you have an input in the href part of the link  \njvelociter - (14:35): you have to display it differently in inline mode I guess  \nbblfish - (14:35): ah ok.
