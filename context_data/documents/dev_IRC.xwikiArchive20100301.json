 \nvmassol - (16:25): yes  \nsdumitriu - (16:25): K, I'll try  \nvmassol - (16:25): I don't know if it'll work actually  \nsdumitriu - (16:25): What else would need escaping?  \nvmassol - (16:25): let me find the code again  \ntmortagne - (16:26): not sure we support escaping for ? actually  \nvmassol - (16:26): tmortagne: yes that's what I wanted to check, probably not  \ntmortagne - (16:26): and in any case it would need double escaping  \ntmortagne - (16:26): [[page~~?]]  \nsdumitriu - (16:26): Panels/MyRecentModifications uses HTML  \nsdumitriu - (16:27): None works  \nvmassol - (16:27): no we don't support escaping it  \nvmassol - (16:27): there are 3 characters that would need this:  \nvmassol - (16:28): ?, @ and #  \ntmortagne - (16:28): yes just tested and i doubt we support escaping, at least i did not done it myself for sure  \nvmassol - (16:28): the code is in AbstractLinkParser  \ntmortagne - (16:29): @ ?  \ntmortagne - (16:29): interwiki ?  \nvmassol - (16:29): is that a question?  \nvmassol - (16:29): yes  \nvmassol - (16:29): @ is for interwiki links  \ntmortagne - (16:29): ok  \nvmassol - (16:29): (which isn't implemented in 2.0 syntax right now)  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): So?  \nsdumitriu - (16:30): What do we do?  \ntmortagne - (16:30): so indeed that's a big limitation and we should implement escaping  \nvmassol - (16:30): 1) jira issue for escaping link content for ?, @ and #  \nvmassol - (16:30): 2) use html for now to fix the pb in the blog  \nvmassol - (16:30): wdyt?  \njvdrean - (16:31): vmassol: yes I can upgrade xwiki.org and myxwiki.org  \nvmassol - (16:31): jvdrean: wooho cool :)  \nsdumitriu - (16:31): I don't like 2, but yes, that's the nly thing that can be done for now  \ntmortagne - (16:31): vmassol: sounds good for now, we don't have much choice  \nvmassol - (16:31): creating jira  \nsdumitriu - (16:33): tmortagne: What's your strategy on XWIKI-4955 ?  \nsdumitriu - (16:34): I wanted to implement a \"Resource\" (?) object, which would pinpoint a resource in its exact place: skin property, attachment, file, template...  \nvmassol - (16:34): tmortagne: hmm shouldn't we use a different syntax instead of query string, anchors and interwiki links?  \ntmortagne - (16:34): sdumitriu: i was about to committ, my strategy is pretty much what i said in the issue: adding a new method that throws exceptions instead of always returning \"\" and use it in Utils.parseTemplate  \nsdumitriu - (16:34): And if a Resource object is found (not null) then leave the empty result  \nvmassol - (16:34): as in [[reference||queryString=\"\u2026\" interwiki=\"\u2026\" anchor=\"\u2026\"]]  \nsdumitriu - (16:35): vmassol: +1  \ntmortagne - (16:35): vmassol: well it's a little late now but probably sinc eit's not supposed to be part of the document name  \nsdumitriu - (16:35): vmassol: Except for http: links  \nsdumitriu - (16:35): Actually except non-wiki links  \nvmassol - (16:36): created: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-4957  \ntmortagne - (16:37): sdumitriu: i don't understand what your \"Resource\" object has to do with my issue  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): tmortagne: \"the content is trimmed\" should not be \"fixed\" IMO  \ntmortagne - (16:37): sdumitriu: why ?  \ntmortagne - (16:37): it's part of the content  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): Does it matter?  \nsdumitriu - (16:37): I don't think anybody is interested in the whitespace  \ntmortagne - (16:37): that's the other way around, if it doe snot matter i don't see why we need to modify the content  \nsdumitriu - (16:38): Fewer bytes transfered  \ntmortagne - (16:38): and you could use it for some reason  \ntmortagne - (16:38): exampl: get the source of a document, if there is some new line at the end you loose them  \ntmortagne - (16:39): it has nothing to do with HTTP it's about content  \ntmortagne - (16:40): i don't see any reason to decide that white spaces are not valid content whatever the use case  \nsdumitriu - (16:41): vmassol: Did you make the blog panel issue?
