Alsio, on a 5.1 works. so something changed in XWIki, not in my code  \n15:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: (when an extension is uninstalled it's kept in local extensions)  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: check the irc logs, I asked questions  \n15:03\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am debugging locally  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only issue there was yesterday was the product column  \n15:03\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, that's the one I am debugging  \n15:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and by looking at the code I don't see how it could have worked  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the JSON returned was of the format:  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[something]  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and the LT was set to consider it as HTML  \n15:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: ok I installed it back but I was looking for the capability of changing my own password and it's still gone :'(  \n15:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0the \"preference\" page is empty  \n15:04\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well it worked, you can check the screenshots form the extensions page. Those were live screenshots. It was working. Something changed  \n15:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: I think your issue is not with that extension  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hen you uninstall an extension its backward dependencies are removed too  \n15:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0which mean XE UI and maybe some others  \n15:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: ok seems like I found it  \n15:05\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0\" User Profile Application\"  \n15:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Hi. About the new wiki API. Do you think the wiki manager that does CRUD operations can also manage operations related to descriptors (getById, getAll, exists, etc...) or should we have a seperate WikiDescriptorManager?  \n15:06\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: ok the issue is that \"User Profile Application\" is linked to \"XWiki Platform - Activity Stream - UI\" and I don't want the later  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sounds like what you are searching for yes, I guess it depends on the user directory extension  \n15:06\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: is there a way to have \"  \n15:07\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: is there a way to have \"User Profile Application\" and not \"XWiki Platform - Activity Stream - UI\" ?  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I know a hack but without a hack no way  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you should create an issue on jira explaining that you don't find really nice you have User Profile Application depends on Wiki Platform - Activity Stream - UI  \n15:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I have rolledback to your modifications, and moving to debug locally.  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: in the meantime what you can do is let XWiki install XWiki Platform - Activity Stream - UI but remove its pages  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I can't assure you that user profile will work well if you do that  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the thing is there is an activity stream in the users profiles  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so that's why it depends on it  \n15:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but I agree with you it's not very nice to have that hard dependency  \n15:10\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: ok, good to know  \n15:11\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0tmortagne: thx for the help :)  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I only modified the webhome page to remove HTML  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in the livetable field for product)  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and that didn't help obviously since the JSON is generating wrong content  \n15:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Slashman: you'r welcome  \n15:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: well in my custom livetable results I am generating HTML content for that column.
