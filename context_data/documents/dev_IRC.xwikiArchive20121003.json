I have a question. Looking in multi tenancy mode. And I see this is enabled by default in the XEM distribution. xwiki.virtual=1. My question is, which option is the one to use subdomains to access the wikis instead of accessing them using the same base url ?  \n13:25\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I guess it's xwiki.virtual.usepath  \n13:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yes it's xwiki.virtual.usepath  \n13:33\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0note that domain based always work whatever the mode  \n13:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0xwiki.virtual.usepath just enabled path based and make it the default when generating an external URL  \n13:35\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/AccessWiki for reference documentation  \n13:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: I think there is an error on the page. It states that. \"By default this mode is disabled. To enable it, go to xwiki.cfg and set xwiki.virtual.usepath to 1.\". But this is the default we have now, so by default this mode is enabled. can you configm the mistake ?  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: yes it's not up to date, could you update it?  \n13:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: the page is just old  \n13:54\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, updating.  \n13:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we recently made it enabled by default  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in the past domain was by default and we changed that in XXXXX  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(checking when that was)  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(since it needs to be put in the doc)  \n13:55\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, I remember that.  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XEM-204  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a03.3RC1+  \n13:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XEM-204 was the first step actually  \n13:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0was enabled in XEM only  \n13:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0not by default in platform  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n13:57\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too bad Enygma` didn't link to the other issue for XE ;)  \n13:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7310  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0linking  \n13:58\u00a0<+Enygma`>\u00a0must of missed it...  \n13:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0do I have to put the jira issues too in the doc ?  \n13:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: no  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: np  \n13:58\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: ok  \n13:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: no  \n13:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0just the version  \n14:03\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:04\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reminder: tomorrow is bug fixing day!  \n15:29\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cool :)  \n15:29\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0you should send an e-mail on the thread  \n15:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:27\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<AndreasJonsson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:50\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n17:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:24\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: question: who is responsible for aggregating in the final release notes the documentation about a feature that was developed during M1, M2,..
