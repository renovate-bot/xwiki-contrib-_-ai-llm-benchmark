AFAIK there is already support for refresh=1 in the URL when you want to force refreshing the cache  \n12:39\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/flushcahce/flushcache/  \n12:40\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's taken into account at com.xpn.xwiki.internal.cache.rendering.DefaultRenderingCache AFAICS  \n12:42\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0because refresh=1 can only be used for current request... if you need to programatically flush rendering cache, there is no way how to do that (for example if you listen on document change, so you can flush cache of document that uses that document's data)  \n12:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why no an API at RenderingCache then ?  \n12:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0make more sense to me  \n12:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(you can reset the whole cache by initialize() I think BTW)  \n12:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/by/by calling/  \n12:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sorry lunch time, bb in 1 or 2h  \n12:47\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0yeah, good point... frankly i cannot remember now, why exactly i added that to document... probably because i didn't know if renderingcache has visible API  \n12:47\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n12:55\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has quit  \n13:16\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:18\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:40\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Hello. I believe making a plugin to sync xwiki users to ldap may have problems.  \n13:40\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0At least in case of making it for general public.  \n14:04\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: actually RenderingCache is in internal package so it's not that public  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: the code you added is not very XWiki codestyle, you should use the formater configuration we have on http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/DevelopmentTools#HCheckstyle  \n14:15\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(maybe it's actually not your code, not sure what is yours and what come from the other PR)  \n14:26\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: yeah, most of it isn't my code... i will look at the checkstyle  \n14:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0DarkKnightCZ: does not make much sense to me that RenderingCacheAware system is only supported for plugins, plugins that are totally deprecated techno and skinx is not rewritten as component just because we did not had time yet  \n14:31\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's almost the same as explicitely checking for skin extension plugin  \n14:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Mr tmortagne, I've a question. What do you make of this? \u00a0https://ezcrypt.it/YG8n#00uwuy1iE2SuAcXA3HLA73pJ  \n14:35\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I set dependency version constraint to [1.1, \u00a0\u00a0and it seems to try to find exactly that version  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: looks like a nullpointer badly written by the displayer, you should have the detailes exception in the related status.xml  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue seems to be \"Caused by: $throwable.class: null\"  \n14:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0./data/jobs/status/extension/action/calebjamesdelisle%3Artwiki/wiki%3Axwiki/status.xml  \n14:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0./data/jobs/status/distribution/status.xml  \n14:37\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0first or second?  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the one related to the extension you tried to install  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0./data/jobs/status/distribution/status.xml is generated by the distribution wizard  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you have a statux.xml generated for each job (as long as the job have an id)  \n14:38\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://sprunge.us/eADR  \n14:39\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh ok this is probably because I'm not releasing through maven and instead just making the objects on extensions.xwiki.org  \n14:40\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0is that a sensible line of thinking?  \n14:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0well, it looks like it checks on http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public \u00a0first and drops dead when not finding it there. I thought that should be allowed (i.e. not being on nexus.xwiki.org first) \u00a0and it goes on to the next repo then  \n14:42\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: no, version range is resolved client side so it does not matter from where your extension is coming from  \n14:43\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0cjd: according to the stack trace looks like EM is ending up with version \"[1.1,\" which is not a valid range  \n14:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you really have that in one of your extensions or is it a bug in EM ?  \n14:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's not a valid range?  \n14:44\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0tmortagne: you would still need to modify AbstractSkinExtensionPlugin to achieve such functionality (but in the other way around, i can hardly think of any other usage of that interface)  \n14:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I put it as the constraint because it is written that way in the documetation  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0``Dependency version constraint is the version related information of the dependency.
