Aside of that the As is known not to be blazing fast, but as it is loaded via ajax, this should not affect the rest of the page  \n13:08\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0How can I check if a indexes is missing. I just create them once. But if some users edit pages several times the AS gets slower and slower. As soon I remove the AS from Dashboard it runs fast  \n13:09\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0On normal days when the AS only shows page small page edits the page loads between 1-5sec  \n13:11\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0On normal days when the AS only shows updates from small page edits like 1-2 edits per page, the dashboard loads in 1-5 sec. But if a users edits a page 10+ times then the Dashboard takes over 10sec to load  \n13:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0then DB index might not really help, seems some logic inside the activity steam itself takes lots of time. I think this is a known issue  \n13:21\u00a0<Danilo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:23\u00a0<Danilo>\u00a0Hello People, I would like a opinion. Do you think that is possible to track all activity in XWiki per user, for example, I will have various documents attached in a page and we want to track who viewed and who download these archives... I was wondering if is it possible to make an aplication that give this kind of control in a wiki.  \n13:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n13:39\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I think the statistics module (if enabled) collect data like that. not sure about the downloads, however  \n13:41\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:42\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0What about web server http logs?  \n13:42\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0hm.. no user info I guess  \n13:43\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0gdelhumeau: hello  \n13:44\u00a0<Danilo>\u00a0I am using Piwik to analyze the infos however I just can get the IP of the user not the user in wiki  \n13:47\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0msmeria1: hello  \n13:47\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0gdelhumeau: regarding XWIKI-9904, if I can successfully create a subwiki from a template and add some members at creation, does that mean it's fixed ?  \n13:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0msmeria1: yes  \n13:48\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0msmeria1: you will check it by addign at least 3 members and control they are there after the creation  \n13:48\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0gdelhumeau: ok. thanks!  \n13:49\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0msmeria1: thx you for testing!  \n13:49\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0gdelhumeau: np. I added 4 members and they're all added to the subwiki  \n13:50\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so it's good :)  \n13:57\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0Danilo: Piwik has some \"extra variables\"; if you use on of these extra variables as the user name that should work. You will have to adapt the piwik code \u00a0used in the xwiki pages to achieve that  \n14:00\u00a0<Danilo>\u00a0Great Clemens I will research to see how to make it possible,  \n14:00\u00a0<Danilo>\u00a0thank you  \n14:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0piwik \u00a0actually calls it \"custom variables\": \u00a0http://piwik.org/docs/custom-variables/  \n14:20\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:28\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<Danilo>\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<ekarlso->\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<ekarlso>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0tmortagne: XWIKI-9993 is reproduced evend with WikiStream enabled for import  \n15:08\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0even\\*  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria1: actually I was more expecting that you would tell me that you forgot to disabled wikistream :)  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if the issue come from standard import it's a very serious issue  \n15:09\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0it seems it is by default unrelated to WikiStream  \n15:10\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0this is the first time I tested this feature (&history=true) otherwise I would've caught it sooner  \n15:11\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it's not much tested since we don't want history in applications  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0msmeria1: I actually meant \"Do\" and not \"So\" in my comment  \n15:15\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0tmortagne: I got that :) either way my answer applies to it  \n15:59\u00a0<msmeria1>\u00a0has quit  \n16:09\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Hello, is there a way to get the XWiki as root page of my web Server.

Unless you consider it too dangerous  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you hadn't worked on it, I wouldn't have pushed it for 5.x though but you worked on it :)  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we might as well bundle it in 5.4.1  \n17:24\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0did we release 5.4?

As mentioned it's the goal of 6.x to not add too many features and work on improving what's there  \n22:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw we didn't add a lot of features in 5.x either, we also focused on improving existing stuff, except for the DW/EM which is the plan to make xwiki even more slim and mean  \n22:11\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0mmm right  \n22:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0DW/EM is a big piece  \n22:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0a complex piece  \n22:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which still require work to be perfect  \n22:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not a lot of software are doing the extension mechanism right (look at eclipse which is far from perfect and require restarts ;))  \n22:12\u00a0<Inge->\u00a0hehe  \n22:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and in our case it's much more complex than Eclipse  \n22:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since users can change the extensions code (equivalent of eclipse plugins)  \n22:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(so we need to merge)  \n22:13\u00a0<CapNemo>\u00a0ouch, I managed to create a page with the name carrying ${channel} and I can't delete it :-/  \n22:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n22:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can do this:  \n22:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0use a velcoity script to use $xwiki.getXWiki().deleteDocument()  \n22:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0was trying to find a snippet on e.x.o  \n22:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cannot find it although I was sure we had one  \n22:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0$xwiki.getXWiki().deleteDocument($doc.getDocument(), false, \u00a0$context.context)  \n22:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(CapNemo)  \n22:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you'll need PR though  \n22:17\u00a0<CapNemo>\u00a0mmm I see what you mean  \n22:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(the false means to not go in the trash)  \n22:17\u00a0<CapNemo>\u00a0and how do you get $doc here ?
