I pointed it out to him :P  \n10:28\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:34\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0doesn anyone have any idea why don't we have a button to exit \"Print Preview\" mode ? IMO we should add a button  \n10:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://www.ucdetector.org/  \n10:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That thing looks like it could be fun  \n10:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Maybe even worth installing eclipse for  \n10:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, but if code is used in another project, how can the plugin detect it ?  \n10:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It can't but we can deprecate the unused code and then 2 releases remove it and let other projects adapt.  \n10:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but looks nice in smaller projects (where all code is in the same project)  \n10:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0There is code in xwiki-core which is understood to be internal and if people are using it externally, they do so at their risk.  \n11:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Hmm it has an ant job. I could probably rig it up to make reports using the reporting tool I wrote.  \n11:01\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0cjdelisle: are you sure findbugs doesn't report that?  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0btw intellij does that for me on the fly  \n11:03\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0the problem is that you're never sure  \n11:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yea yea yea proprietary :P  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0I mean you can never be sure a method is not called  \n11:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You mean because it might be reflected?  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0it's not  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0proprietary  \n11:04\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0it's open source  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(the community edition at least)  \n11:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Oh, I thought you needed some magic license number or something.  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0they open source the community edition 2 or3 years ago  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2009/10/intellij-idea-open-sourced/  \n11:06\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I hear only good things about IntelliJ  \n11:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't use ides because they're proprietary or slow, I just don't like all of those buttons, giant ui for me to try to learn when I already know the console.  \n11:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*I don't not use...  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0real coders code in assembly language! yeah :)  \n11:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Well... When a program is eating up processor time, taking apart a tight loop might be the best thing to do.  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0yes they're slow but they bring lots of advantages  \n11:08\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0anyway not starting a flamewar\u2026. got to figure out why the blog app broken  \n11:09\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0almost there  \n11:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Cool. I was thinking if we could get reports on unused code then we could deprecate smarter.  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0question: is it better to throw \u00a0NPE or to display the current date when xwiki.formatDate is called with a null date?  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(NPE or another exception for that matter - I'm talking about the velocity API of XWiki not the java one)  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0in the case at hand it would mean all blog entries are displayed with the current date instead of the date the netry has been posted  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0of course the best answer for that use case is to have the extension manager detect an incompatibility of version and report it properly but still it's possible for a script to call formatDate with null  \n11:24\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol1: WDYM blog is broken ? seems working on latest trunk  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0sburjan: I've posted a mail  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a01.26 doesn't work with 3.0M1  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a01.27 works  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0it's \"normal\"  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0but still breaks all blogs on myxwiki.org for example  \n11:25\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well I don't know which version my build uses :P  \n11:25\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0oh, I see  \n11:25\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so it's the migration issue  \n11:34\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm there is still no date for XE 2.7.1...  \n11:34\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I think I found a bug. I set the default language to RO, enable multilingual and add ro, fr. i save, and my wiki is in english language. WDYT ?  \n11:34\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0if I disable multilingual and default is to RO, it works  \n11:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0setting to FR same .. english wiki .. I'm gonna report this  \n11:45\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n11:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol1: with the new rule on JIRA, if I have a issue on trunk, when reporting to JIRA I have to put affects M2, right ?  \n11:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0also backwards where applicable  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0if the problem happens on 3.0M2-SNAPSHOT yes you need to put 3.0M2  \n11:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well I'm testing today's build, which is 3.0-SNAPSHOT.34407  \n11:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this is between M1 and M2  \n11:50\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I'll put affects M1 or both ?  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0if it's presnet in M1 then affects is definitely m1  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0that's important to set right  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0you \\*\\*only\\*\\* put M2 if it \\*\\*doesn't\\*\\* affect M1  \n11:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0stored  \n11:52\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0XWIKI-5953  \n12:25\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:29\u00a0<jvelociter>\u00a0has quit  \n13:06\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:07\u00a0<abusenius\\_>\u00a0is now known as <abusenius>  \n13:11\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:22\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:38\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I think I found another bug. I create a space. I go to Admin Space. It seems the WebPreferences page is created. That page seems to be orphan. is it normal ? (I see it's orphan by adding the Orphan pages panel) .. note that \\_only\\_ spaces added by user and admin have this behaviour. The spaces that come with default build don't. Any idea if it's a bug ?  \n13:41\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/edit/Test+Space/WebPreferences?editor=wiki doesn't list any Parent, and for example WebPreferences from Invitation Space has \u00a0has parent: Invitation.WebHome  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0sburjan: yes you can created a jira for this, as an improvement  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(it's a bit harsh to consider it a bug)  \n13:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0well .. it's a bit bad to have orphan pages  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0s/created/create/  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0sure  \n13:42\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, I'll make an improvement  \n13:43\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0(it's allowed though)  \n13:43\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes, but you can get confused if you don't see your page in Tree list for example  \n13:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0in which xwiki core component this should be reported ?  \n13:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ucdetectoring /core/trunk/... \u00a0\u00a0my poor disk is like \"why me?\"  \n13:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0Templates and User Interface ?  \n13:45\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think you want to make that in the \"user interface\" section.  \n13:45\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0thanks  \n13:51\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XWIKI-5955  \n14:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0vmassol1: when I modify something in the Search page from Administer Wiki, a new page called SearchConfig is created ?  \n14:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That's normal  \n14:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0is it normal also to be orphan ?  \n14:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0heh, I suppose it should not but it is not critical.  \n14:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I know. but it's gonna be reported anyway as an improvement  \n14:06\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0XWIKI-5956  \n14:35\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n14:37\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:31\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n15:40\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:42\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n15:43\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:47\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:17\u00a0<lynxt>\u00a0has quit  \n16:21\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0can anybody running one of the latest snapshotc confirm that enabling accessibility features : doesn't do \\_anything\\_ (not working) ?  \n16:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0bye. have a nice weekend, everybody  \n16:43\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bye  \n16:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0too late  \n16:52\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n16:55\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:12\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:17\u00a0<kwoot>\u00a0has quit  \n17:44\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n17:52\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:55\u00a0<lucaa1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:14\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:14\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:17\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n18:31\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:36\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0What is the status of com.xpn.xwiki.store.jcr.\\*?  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0unused for sure  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd also say unfinished  \n18:37\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0So a proposal to deprecate woule be warmly received?  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could be moved to retired probably  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0deprecate isn't needed  \n18:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it's never been used/ready  \n18:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I see.
