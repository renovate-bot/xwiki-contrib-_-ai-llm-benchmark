So a user goes to a non existing page and sees a link to create that page so he clicks it. He is taken to the create form where he has to choose the page template, but the rest should be pre-filled, including the page name.\"  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I don't see this when I try it  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm actually it seems my fix has been rolled back  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking commits  \n09:55\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0I didn't rollback  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't get the behavior of my fix anymore  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm getting the previous behavior now  \n09:56\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0make sure you have a template defined (with a template provider)  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n09:56\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0well, I didn't rollback anything  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm talking about default behavior  \n09:57\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0the current behavior takes you directly to edit mode, that's why I wrote:  \n09:57\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8742?focusedCommentId=76931&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-76931  \n09:59\u00a0<mflorea1>\u00a0in the commits tab I see only one commit, which touches only createinline.vm, but the redirect decision it made in CreateAction, so your commit can't change the behavior  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0strange, AFAIR this change was enough to make it work for me.

I'm here to report what seems to be an API breakage. We used to use xwiki.mailsender.sendMessageFromTemplate to send mails from 5 of our applications, with xwiki 4.5.3. Now that we upgraded to 5.1, this method doesn't accept \"xwiki.null\" as one of the parameters  \n13:59\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0sendMessageFromTemplate(String\u00a0from,\u00a0String\u00a0to,\u00a0String\u00a0cc,\u00a0String\u00a0bcc,\u00a0String\u00a0language,\u00a0String\u00a0documentFullName, VelocityContext\u00a0vcontext)  \n14:00\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0We used to have 'xwiki.null' \u00a0for 'cc' and 'bcc', but it doesn't work anymore... How can we replace it? Do we have to put the same mail address there in cc and bcc than in 'to', to make it work ?  \n14:54\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0nobody? :(  \n14:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it's a bug you should report it  \n14:56\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0When I see that it doesn't accept a certain kind of object anymore, I admit it's a feature and not a bug, but if nobody is aware about it, then I'll report it  \n14:56\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0thanks  \n14:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know this domain so I cannot give you more info  \n14:56\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0I'll replace xwiki.null by the same mail address, because this is a critical command for us  \n14:57\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0method\\*  \n15:26\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:04\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:17\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:32\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:49\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:06\u00a0<Mariah>\u00a0has quit  \n17:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:23\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:39\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has quit  \n19:17\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:18\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:45\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:19\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:23\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:23\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>\n"}
