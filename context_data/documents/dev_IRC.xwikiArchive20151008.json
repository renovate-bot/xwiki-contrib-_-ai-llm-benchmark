\n09:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0note that we're also 2 days away from 7.3M1 release date  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to look at the CI to stabilize the build  \n09:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0plenty of jobs failing ATM  \n09:08\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n09:22\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki

look at XWIKI-12667, you know this part better than I do: to summarize because of Zip explorer it's impossible to download a zip attachment located in a nested document  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes indeed this is not supported  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0made the title more clear  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you don't understand  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12448  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you can't download any zip file  \n09:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's a dup of 12448?  \n09:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I'm not talking about reading inside a zip file  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the zip explorer breaks any zip attachment before you get a chance to download it  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0only for Nested Spaces right?  \n09:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0seems so  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what does the zipexplorer have to do with download action?  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO it's the same issue  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the zip explorer think you want to read in the file and is trying to find the attachment file name inside it  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it should do nothing  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok I see  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so yes it's the same issue definietly  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no it's not the same  \n09:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just that I didn't think of this use case which makes the issue more important  \n09:59\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yea a bit more important...  \n10:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok starting meeting, I'll check later, adding to my stack  \n10:00\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0IMO it should stay as too different issues, it's ok that zip explorer does not support reading inside a zip file in nested document for now but it should not break everything  \n10:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I'll check it later on  \n10:21\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:03\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki

URIBuilder classloader/dependency mess but I'm lost for now...  \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0looks like some JAX-RS 1.0 URIBuilder is still in the classloader but I can't find it  \n14:46\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n14:58\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hmm now I understand but I don't understand how restlet was even able to build...  \n15:05\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0has quit

\n15:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0one more proof they don't care about JAX-RS: https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/issues/1158  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0tests involving REST should work better now, until we find another mistake like this  \n15:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0hope they will fix it quickly  \n15:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0dreams are my reality....  \n15:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)
