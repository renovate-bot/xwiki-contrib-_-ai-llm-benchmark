Do you have any hints on how to exclude these parent dependencies?  \n18:38\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I searched a bit and someone suggests on a forum to declare these dependencies as runtime in the child pom. I haven't tried  \n18:42\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you should not need to exclude them  \n18:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you get them it's because they don't use the proper scope  \n18:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0they are supposed to use <scope>test</scope>  \n18:44\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: what dependency comes with junit ?  \n18:44\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: they are inherited, they don't come as a transitive dependency  \n18:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha right  \n18:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but even that they should use the right scope  \n18:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0mvn dependency:tree show them at the first level, and they are not declared in the pom  \n18:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm but you should not inherit them AFAIK  \n18:45\u00a0<fmancinelli1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:45\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n18:45\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0let me check core pom  \n18:45\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0but I think the scope is right in core  \n18:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it's using <scope>test</scope>  \n18:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0si you will not get them in the war  \n18:46\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0enforcer is not very clever...  \n18:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n18:47\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it doesn't have to many options either  \n18:48\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0I can't configure it to ban only junit from transitive dependencies  \n18:48\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm  \n18:50\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the alternative is to remove them from core parent pom, for most of the project it's ok I guess since they get them from xwiki-platform-test or xwiki-commons-test  \n18:50\u00a0<fmancinelli1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0wait  \n18:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we could maybe write a custom rule  \n18:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it looks like I can exclude junit and include only junit with scope test  \n18:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0did not checked the detail but seems it's possible  \n18:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ha  \n18:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0since scope test is not packaged  \n18:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0let me try  \n18:54\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0custom rule would make use write an extension, let not add another project that has to be built alone ;)  \n18:55\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0:)  \n18:55\u00a0<ankur>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: i think you can exclude stuff with scope build  \n18:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0i mean compile  \n18:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since i can see we have  \n18:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0<exclude>javax.servlet:servlet-api:\\*:\\*:compile</exclude>  \n18:57\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0yes, but maybe it comes with a different scope  \n18:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can list several  \n18:57\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is not infinite number of scopes  \n18:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0compile is the default one  \n18:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0it should be enough  \n18:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can also add runtime to be safe  \n18:58\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0sure, but right now I'm trying to exclude all and include only scope:test  \n18:58\u00a0<ihalip>\u00a0has quit  \n18:58\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0but i don't see anyone adding a runtime dependency to junit...  \n18:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0other scopes should not be resolved as transitive dependencies  \n18:59\u00a0<ankur>\u00a0has quit  \n19:02\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: it works with exclude all + include only scope:test. do you prefer to exclude only scope:compile?
