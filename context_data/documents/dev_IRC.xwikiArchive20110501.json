I never really had a cell phone, still don't.  \n14:03\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0hmm i think i should first get familiar with the code base first.  \n14:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Anyway, we need to generate custom PersistanceCapable objects for each user defined object which is why I wrote the test that uses groovy to compile a class, we can generate a class in groovy to represent the user defined object.  \n14:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The other problem is we need to get querying to work  \n14:05\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0hmm well now we have more time than gsoc  \n14:06\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0so we can come up with smthing :)  \n14:07\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Ahh, querying is not that big a deal, most of it is handled in DataNucleus. I have been reading over that code base the past few weeks. JPQL is handled very nicely and (absent a specification) XWQL is really just JPQL with the () notation added.  \n14:08\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle: ahh great :)  \n14:08\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle: im going to start building platform  \n14:09\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0cjdelisle: hope ill get it done without any build errors  \n14:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\"doc.object(XWiki.SomeClass) AS obj\" maps to JPQL notation \"IN(doc.xObjects) obj WHERE obj.className = 'XWiki.SomeClass'\"  \n14:10\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0ahh they are the same when you shuffle them around aren't they  \n14:11\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yes so as long as we are careful about schema, that is the only thing we need to do in order to get XWQL working  \n14:12\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0hmm  \n14:23\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n15:06\u00a0<florinciu>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:46\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:01\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has quit  \n17:46\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n20:05\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n20:08\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0Hello xwiki-ers. Does anyone know if the hibernate cache can be somewhat \"enlarged\" ??  \n20:51\u00a0<bbc581>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The level2 cache? I think it could and you would have to look in to hibernate configuration and it would be options in the hibernate.cfg.xml file  \n22:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0If what you are doing is loading documents then you may want to expand the document cache instead.  \n22:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the document cache is XWikiDocument instances already in ram which means they will be even faster than hibernate cache  \n22:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0OTOH if you're looking for faster queries then the level 2 cache might be your answer  \n22:46\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:30\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:31\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:32\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:51\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0hey guys  \n23:51\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0http://xwiki.475771.n2.nabble.com/Add-a-user-on-a-User-List-property-td2258743.html#a2274368 i found this threat  \n23:51\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0and i have the same question  \n23:51\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0is it possible?  \n23:51\u00a0<mar3lis>\u00a0and if yes, how?  \n\n"}
