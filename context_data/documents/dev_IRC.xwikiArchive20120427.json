 \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we can remove anything in platform  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0provided it's not bundled in the XE distrib?  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it was distributed  \n11:51\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0not remove, move  \n11:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as maven artifact  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't agree with this  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex  \n11:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0the artifact wasn't usable  \n11:52\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0it's a GWT jar  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still think it violates  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the rule  \n11:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because you took a unilateral decision  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I really want us to be careful re removal of stuff from now on  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is why there's this rule now  \n11:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0there was a vote a long time ago to don't include this plugin in the WYSIWYG - i.e. to not compile it in the editor code  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0i still think we need to be more careful and it doesn't cost much  \n11:53\u00a0<+mflorea>\u00a0so it's live having a module in platform that is not used and we move it to retired, anyone can stil use it from retired  \n11:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well then  \n11:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do we have thise rules?
