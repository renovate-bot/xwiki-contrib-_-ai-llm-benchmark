We'll try to do it this week.  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n15:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm letting you answer that thread, ok?  \n15:41\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I'll try to help, but \u00a0I never worked with this, didn't even know we even had this feature :)  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0exactly which is why I'm asking you to test it :)  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(so that you get to know it and can validate it works)  \n15:42\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, I know :)  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't forget it, I'm removing it from my list now and I won't remember it, you're now the owner of it!  \n15:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n15:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0ok :) I'll pass it back if I won't be able to reproduce  \n15:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n15:50\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:05\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: I have a question just to make sure I understood properly. If a translation in a certain language is missing, I should create a issue on xwikiorg project, and if a key is missing I should report a bug to the corresponding project where the code is ?  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no xwikiorg project  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's an XINFRA one though  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I wouldn't do that  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I wouldn't report it I mean  \n16:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's normal that translations are missing  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's the point of l10n to show what's missing  \n16:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0well I started testing which translations do not work in german. and I was told I have to report issues. orders from above  \n16:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0wdym by \"do not work\"?  \n16:07\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I was just talking to manuel that what we are doing is somehow pointless since it is possible to see which translations are missing for german language from l10n  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's 100% bad  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to report missing keys  \n16:08\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0meaning that when I switch to german, I still get them in english  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's even worse than not doing anything  \n16:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you want to see which transaltions are missing there's a link for that  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(a l10n url )  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's nothing to test either  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0l10n does that for you  \n16:09\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I don't know german, so I can't translate them.  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and?  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the realtion with what I said?  \n16:09\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I totally agree  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I think you've lisunderstood somehting  \n16:10\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0none, I get your POV. I think the same  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*misunderstood  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you can do is generate a report (email or wiki page) of the current status of all languages and # of missing translations  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but this has nothing to do with JIRA  \n16:11\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, I know. Silvia told me to report issues with missing keys or translations. This is why I asked where to report in JIRA  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0missing keys is something else  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0missing keys means the code is not internationalized  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so this needs to be reported in jira  \n16:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0yes, I'll report those. I only h ave 2 of them  \n16:12\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0thanks vmassol  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0np  \n16:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:20\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:30\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:40\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n16:44\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:02\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n17:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: I don't know why it need right after the title, because maybe it's too late if you put it after  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0evalica: well you need to find out  \n17:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0would you like to link in the code the stackoverflow answer?  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes that's ok  \n17:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0\u2026.. I don't think is very nice to have links in the code :|  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's better to explain  \n17:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and put a link for more details  \n17:11\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well the JIRA issue is for more details  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0like for ex if there's a full page of details  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're not going to copy paste it in the code  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but a 1-5 lines of explanations is good in the code  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the idea is that whoever looks at the code can understand the reason  \n17:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0in theory I understand what you mean, but I disagree for this issue. I still the comment is enough and I don't think every decision in XWiki is well explained and commented  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0definitely not  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you said:  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\"placed\u00a0right\u00a0after\u00a0the\u00a0title\"  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is very very very bad  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't mean anything  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems to say that it's important to be after the title  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it doesn't say so explicitly  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0whether it's needed  \n17:13\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well I put it in another place and didn't worked : )  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or is just a void comment  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you cannot code at random caty  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:(  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to understand what you're doing  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0at the very minimum you need a big large comment  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to explain that you don't understand why it needs to be there  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that it doesn't work if not there  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ofc it's better that you spend the time to understand why obviously  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otherwise yo'ure just pushing that answer to the next dev  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not putting anything is really bad  \n17:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well I suspect why .. but i don't know were to find the official 'documentation' of the reason why in order to reference it  \n17:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0\\*where  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is what's killing us in lots of places in the old core FTR  \n17:15\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0well there is a link in the JIRA issue  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sigh  \n17:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0is not 'nothing'  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0how am I suposed to know that by looking at the code?  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the more documentation you add to your code to help the next code, the better it is\u2026 you should try to modify old core stuff and you'll tear your hair and you'll curse whoever wrote it for several generations just asking yourself why the guy didn't spend 1 minute to add some comments\u2026. ;)  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/code/coder/  \n17:22\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as you progress in coding (especially OSS) you'll realize more and more that you're not coding for yourself but for the others and you'll be more and more careful about how you write code so that there's less WTF moment later on...  \n17:32\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n17:45\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0vmassol: hope is better like this  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks caty, sorry to be a pita  \n17:46\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0thanks vincent :) np - you were right - I'm glad I found the specification :P  \n17:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:58\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n18:18\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:06\u00a0<jbwiv>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:45\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n22:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:17\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has quit  \n22:22\u00a0<kstuart>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:24\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:09\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:09\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n23:09\u00a0<polx\\_>\u00a0is now known as <polx>  \n23:47\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit\n"}
