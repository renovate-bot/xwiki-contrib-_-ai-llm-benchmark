I have a velocity related question: Is it possible to get the value from this concatenation? $request.content$lg  \n09:40\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0where $lg comes from #foreach($lg in [\"en\",\"fr\",\"pl\",\"es\"])  \n09:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm not sure about that exact notation but I think \"${request.content}$lg\" should work  \n09:42\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0let's try, I tried a lot of combinations with {} and \"\" but none of it work  \n09:42\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0be careful about what you do with post parameters, all users are evil and want to own your system :P  \n09:43\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n09:44\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0nop, that didn't work  \n09:44\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0only $lg got interpreted  \n09:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0if you put $request.content alone it works?  \n09:47\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0yes it does  \n09:47\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0How about trying: \u00a0\"$request.getParameter('content')$lg\" It shouldn't matter but if there is an issue with velocity then that might work.  \n09:51\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0that didn't work either. I'm not sure if it matters but I'm using it like this $docWrapperByAPI.set($contentProp, \"$request.getParameter('content')$lg\")  \n09:51\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0(not the exact variable names but that doesn't matter)  \n09:52\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0in this particular case the value from $contentProp is $request.getParameter('content')en  \n09:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Did you try using a #set directive first?  \n09:52\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0I'll give it a try  \n09:53\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0\\*brute  \n09:53\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0:)  \n10:00\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:02\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0no, that didn't work either  \n10:02\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0running out of options  \n10:02\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0in my case, brute force would mean getting rid of the #foreach and assigning the value for each 4 languages  \n10:03\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0but I'm a fan of DRY  \n10:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0#set($out = \"$request.getParameter('content')\" + $lg)  \n10:03\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0s/a/not a  \n10:03\u00a0<mpaun>\u00a0has quit  \n10:03\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0oups what I said was correct  \n10:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0#foreach($lg in [\"en\",\"fr\",\"pl\",\"es\"]) that might not be supported  \n10:04\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0#set($allLanguages = [\"en\",\"fr\",\"pl\",\"es\"])  \n10:05\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0no, it is  \n10:05\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0I know for sure, I've used it in other places  \n10:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Ok, the only reason I mentioned it is because there are certain things which are supported in #set directives but not supported anywhere else  \n10:06\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0#set($concat = \"con\" + \"cat\") is one of them  \n10:08\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0it worked with #set($out = $request.getParameter(\"content$lg\"))  \n10:09\u00a0<mihaipaun>\u00a0now, what options do I have to sanitize the user input?  \n10:11\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0What are you doing with it?

I have seen numerous big projects which would miserably fail our code style validator.  \n23:43\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The old code, not so much but heh it's deprecated.  \n23:43\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0Ah, I've only looked at the new code then ;)  \n23:44\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0What I'm seeing is your HttpServletRequest apparently has no host parameter.  \n23:45\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0So do I need to modify some of the jetty configuration? Or is there another property? Maybe the host name fails some rule?  \n23:46\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It shouldn't be anything to do with the jetty configuration. You are using HSQL so you only have a single wiki.  \n23:46\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0I'm using Oracle as the DB, but only need a single wiki  \n23:46\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0Is that the problem?  \n23:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0No, it's the wiki parameter which is hanging it up. Why did you set the xwiki.home= parameter in the xwiki.cfg?  \n23:47\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0If I don't set it I get the same behavior  \n23:47\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0If I use the IP without it set, it works as well I just tried that  \n23:48\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0so it's just the hostname it has problems with  \n23:48\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Does the hostname have a dot in it?  \n23:49\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0nope, it's j-sonic\\_wiki-m plus domain  \n23:50\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the underscore is an invalid character in domains.  \n23:50\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:51\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0ok I bet that is the problem. \u00a0Stupid me!  \n23:51\u00a0<robe\\_\\_>\u00a0thank you  \n23:52\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Sure thing.
