Til xwiki6 I've used this solution: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/List+Children+Of+Current+Document to list all sub pages of a page. But with xwiki 7.2 the result is empty  \n10:10\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0How can I set the current page as root= option to {{documentTree /}}/  \n10:11\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0How can I set the current page as root= option to {{documentTree /}}?  \n10:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0zzeroo: interesting, we need to check if we've broken something  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now there's a much better solution with the new documentTree macro  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Document+Tree+Macro  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh I see you've found it  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0adding doc  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0check this diff zzeroo  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne, mflorea: do you think you could check why http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/List+Children+Of+Current+Document wouldn't be working in 7.2? (I'm starting a meeting now)  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0thanks  \n10:22\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0vmassol: I studdy this pages for hours. What is a generic way to set the root with the current page? {{documentTree root=\"document:$doc\" /}} dosn't work  \n10:22\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0zerroo: did you check the description of the root parameter? http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Document+Tree+Macro#HParameters  \n10:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0zzeroo: you sure your {{documentTree root=\"document:$doc\" /}} is inside velocity macro ?  \n10:33\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0the script from \"List Children Of Current Document\" work for me on 7.3-SNAPSHOT  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok cool thanks, we need more info from zzeroo  \n10:34\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0tmortagne: Thank you. I've forget the velocity tags. First problem solved. My xwiki version is 7.2 and the \"List Children Of Current Document\" shows nothing on a page with subpages. I try to update  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0zzeroo: ah yes I guess that script doesn't handle nested spaces but it should still work for non nested spaces  \n10:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but that's normal  \n10:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: from what I understand zzeroo use the document tree macro, not sure why we are talking about http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/List+Children+Of+Current+Document script  \n10:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: because he mentioned it ddidn't work  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\"Hi I need help to get the document tree working. Til xwiki6 I've used this solution: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/List+Children+Of+Current+Document\u00a0to list all sub pages of a page. But with xwiki 7.2 the result is empty\"  \n10:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I missed the subpage part initially)  \n10:52\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:52\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n11:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0zzeroo: the script is ok. There are two cases:  \n11:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(1) the passed document is terminal (not a space home page) --> the child pages from anywhere in the wiki are found. This works.  \n11:00\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0(2) the passed document is a space home page ---> only the child pages from that space (without including the subspaces) are found. If you want to look in subspaces too, then the script needs to be modified, but this wasn't it's initial intent.  \n11:02\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0in other words: the script should continue to work fine for your existing pages. Now, if you start creating nested documents/spaces then this script is not useful anymore and you should switch to the document tree macro.  \n11:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: maybe you could add this text to the page (since you've workd to analyse it)?  \n11:04\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:07\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0hi all, tmortagne vmassol how are you doing :)  \n11:08\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0we are now migrating mediawiki to xwiki, and is working more or less fine, except code blocks which are not supported  \n11:08\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0however, now i get something strange  \n11:09\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i get this in my list of space http://imgur.com/VjytumX  \n11:09\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0spaces\\*  \n11:09\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0which is generated with the following code: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/275740/42089751/  \n11:09\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0now, i want to know, where is the \"kettle ?\" entry coming from?  \n11:10\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0the space doesn't exist, so what's going on there  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0usually mean you don't have any space home page (WebHome) for space kettke  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but you still have some pages in this space  \n11:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what does not exist is not the space but the target of the link (which is the space home page)  \n11:11\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0ah i see  \n11:11\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0you are correct  \n11:21\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0Is there a way to show the documentTree complete expanded?  \n11:38\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks we fixed it  \n11:38\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0other small question  \n11:38\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/Howtoincreasethemaximumattachmentsize  \n11:38\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0is this the correct way to increase attachmint size on file based attachments?  \n11:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it seems the official documentation does not work for sub-wikis  \n11:43\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0i followed this guide http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Attachments#HSizeLimit  \n11:44\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0Trefex: Try to restart tomcat. This solved it by me last time  \n11:45\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0zzeroo: ok thanks, i shall try it  \n11:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0it's still too large zzeroo  \n11:51\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0anybody got any ideas?  \n12:00\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0well tmortagne if you have any ideas, i'm ready :)  \n12:11\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has quit  \n12:15\u00a0<fcharton>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:31\u00a0<benedict>\u00a0hi folks, i am using xwiki 7.2 with LDAP. Everything works very well, but i got one problem: I have two \"mail\" attributes in LDAP and i want xwiki to take both of them in the mail field, is that possible?  \n12:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Trefex: looks like XWIKI-12032  \n12:46\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n13:06\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:41\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0Hello again, I try to upload an .docx document as attachment. This fails with an error like this one: http://pastebin.ca/3183980  \n14:42\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0I use the file system store. PDF and Zip files are working ok  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0zzeroo:are you sure pdf and zip work when you use nested spaces?  \n14:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just to rule out NS)  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the error doesn't look like it's related to the type of oducment  \n14:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*document  \n14:47\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0note that from what I see in the code this happen only if Tika fail to parse the content so it actually could happen for some attachments and not others  \n14:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so the fact that the Entity is created with some null values would be a side effect of that problem  \n14:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not really  \n14:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it just not trying to get the reference at all otherwise  \n14:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the nullpointer seems to indicate that the XWikiAttachment does not have any filename  \n14:49\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the IllegalArgumentException I mean  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we're probably missing some check somewhere then  \n14:50\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0zzeroo: it would be great if you could create a jira issue and attachment to it a file on which you can reproduce the issue  \n14:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(if it doesn't raise an exception)  \n14:50\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0The attachments are created but if i download them they contain some html from the Page. very strange  \n14:57\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n15:08\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0tmortagne: thanks for the link, however I'm not sure how to change the setting in the sub-wiki in the first place  \n15:54\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12667  \n15:54\u00a0<zzeroo>\u00a0^^  \n15:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n16:16\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n16:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n16:22\u00a0<gsmeria1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:23\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:38\u00a0<benedict>\u00a0hi folks, i am using xwiki 7.2 with LDAP.
