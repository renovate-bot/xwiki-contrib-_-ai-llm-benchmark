Use position: absolute; bottom: 0;  \nsdumitriu - (16:16): This is not so good and flexible  \nsdumitriu - (16:16): 2. Use display: inline-block + vertical-align;  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:17): OK. I tried something like 1., but maybe on the wrong element (it moved the all div to the bottom of the doc)  \nsdumitriu - (16:17): The problem is that vertical-align works for elements inside a line-block  \nsdumitriu - (16:17): To have a line-block, you need to have inline elements inside it  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:17): ok, 2. is a better approach ?  \nsdumitriu - (16:17): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (16:18): But the question is, how do you want to position the two elements?  \nsdumitriu - (16:18): Side by side?  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:18): so it;s inline-block on the whole container \u00a0? (.alldocs-topfilters)  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:18): yes  \nsdumitriu - (16:18): As in, width: 50% is good?  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:18): side by side  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:18): yep  \nsdumitriu - (16:18): No, inline-block on the two elements  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:18): ok  \nsdumitriu - (16:18): tagcloud, topfilters  \nsdumitriu - (16:18): vertical-align on topfilters  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:19): cool, I'm going to try that  \nsdumitriu - (16:20): Ping me if you need more help with it  \ngvallarelli joined #xwiki at 16:28  \njvelociter\\_ - (16:45): sdumitriu: I must be missing something.
