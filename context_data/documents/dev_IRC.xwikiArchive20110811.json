 \n11:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Just got up  \n11:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:44\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I have some questions: so if I enable FS storage, \\_nothing\\_ will go anymore in the db, and it will go instead directly on the fs ?  \n11:44\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hi, where would be the preferable place to set $obfuscateEmail ?  \n11:45\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0i noticed that behaviour obviously changed after 2.7.1...  \n11:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0sburjan: The attachment metadata such as it's size, filename and uploader will still go in the database so that pages load reasonably fast but the actual content and historical versions of the content will go on the filesystem.  \n11:47\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so I don't have to set anything on \u00a0max\\_allowed\\_packet\\_size  \n11:47\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that is correct  \n11:48\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cool :)  \n12:09\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0any leads on the obfuscateEmail?  \n12:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I don't know, maybe someone else around knows something about it.  \n12:11\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0hmmm mflorea is not around  \n12:12\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0seems he did the change, according to jira...  \n12:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0he's gonna be back next week, he's on holidays  \n12:19\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0haha, figured so. still, i only got today... i just hacked my code into the change like i used  \n12:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cjdelisle: I got a TON of errors after setting up storage and starting it :(  \n12:59\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0what type of system are you using? tomcat based or jetty?  \n13:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I mean is it the integrated system?  \n13:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0jetty + hsqldb 3.1 final  \n13:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0no, the zip from maven  \n13:00\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0another critical issue: it seems that \"Maximum Upload Size\" field does not save its value upon save action  \n13:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yes there are going to be problems with the .zip version.  \n13:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0You can solve that by using the filesystem attachment porter.  \n13:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, I will look into that  \n13:01\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The problem is that when you get the zip version and first start it, the attachments are all saved in the database.  \n13:01\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yepp  \n13:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I will dig deeper  \n13:02\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and about the Max Upl Size ?  \n13:02\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The other option is to use tomcat and import the .xar file \\*after\\* you have turned on filesystem attachments, that way the attachments are only ever saved on the filesystem.  \n13:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0upload\\_maxsize should be okay, if you are having a problem then there is something going wrong with the saving of XWikiPreferences which is out of the scope of attachments.  \n13:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I am making an assesment if fs strorage could go in production, this is why I am asking you all these  \n13:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Keep in mind that if the number is too big, it will fail to save.  \n13:03\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0999999999 will (IIRC) work but like 99999999999999999 will fail to save.  \n13:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0true. that value is confusing. those are bits, bytes, kbits, kbytes ?  \n13:04\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0it's unconsistent IMO  \n13:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0bytes IIRC  \n13:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0wouldn't be simplet to put that number in MB ?  \n13:07\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0instead of all those long numbers  \n13:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I would favor doing away with the global number entirely and fitting it into the permissions system somehow.  \n13:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0but ofc that's difficult...  \n13:09\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes  \n13:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0so basically you get the number you put in the field and divide by 1024 and you get the number of MB ?  \n13:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0no way.. bytes  \n13:10\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0you divide it by 8 and the by 1024  \n13:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0then anyone who has the number set already has their number multiplied by 1024 unless we create another field.  \n13:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0:|  \n13:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0you mean backwards compat  \n13:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0yup  \n13:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes but if you want this in production we should fix these issues before it gets used widely  \n13:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0That number has always been there.  \n13:18\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0anyway, this is not so important, but it might get users very disoriented about huge numbers. they will have to convert bytes to MB or GB .. in order to set the value they really want  \n13:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Something we could change without breaking too many people is to make -1 equal to \"unlimited\"  \n13:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0s/too many people/anyone/  \n13:19\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0is there a max number of chars a filename can have ?  \n13:19\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cjdelisle: I agree to that  \n13:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think it might be 255 (limited by the database) but that's not anything I introduced  \n13:20\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I am trying to attach a file called : en\\_windows\\_server\\_2008\\_r2\\_standard\\_enterprise\\_datacenter\\_and\\_web\\_with\\_sp1\\_x64\\_dvd\\_617601.iso .. and when I press attach nothing happens :)  \n13:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Perhaps there is an error message? IIRC there is a limit on the length of the full path to the file in Windows.  \n13:24\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0I am on ubuntu :)  \n13:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0hmm then that doesn't make sense  \n13:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0echo 'Hello World!' > en\\_windows\\_server\\_2008\\_r2\\_standard\\_enterprise\\_datacenter\\_and\\_web\\_with\\_sp1\\_x64\\_dvd\\_617601.txt  \n13:25\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0then try uploading that with and without FS attachments?  \n13:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cjdelisle: ok, this one works  \n13:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0as txt  \n13:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0the ISO has 2.9 GB  \n13:26\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0but I don't get any error it's beyond allowed size  \n13:26\u00a0<jstoldt>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0IIRC there start to be problems with firefox when you get far over 1GB  \n13:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I tried 1GB and that worked, 4GB and (IIRC) firefox couldn't handle it.  \n13:29\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0seems 2.9 is too much also  \n13:29\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0dd if=/dev/zero of=./1GBof.nulls bs=1024 count=1024  \n14:03\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0this one creates 1 MB file :)  \n14:05\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0oops  \n14:06\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0dd if=/dev/zero of=./1GBof.nulls bs=1024 count=1048576  \n14:08\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0thanks  \n14:13\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0cjdelisle: ok, so I got the 10 mb error, even that max allowed attach size is larger than 1 GB, and I also get a JS error from FF .. script hanging  \n14:14\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0and the file is not on the server  \n14:15\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0disabled firebug, trying again  \n14:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0goto /bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object and check the value of upload\\_maxsize  \n14:17\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0ok, now I got a time out  \n14:18\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0maximum upload size is : 999999999  \n14:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ok and you're using firefox I assume  \n14:18\u00a0<+sburjan>\u00a0yes.

Unless it's causing problems with default XE  \n21:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I may have documented it already  \n21:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm no I can't find it on http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/InstallationJetty  \n21:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this page looks minimal\u2026. hmmm  \n21:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(well minimal is good \u00a0it means it's easy and works OOB ;))  \n21:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO we should document this param on this page  \n21:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at minimum)  \n21:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sdumitriu: would be nice to have that review macro on extensions.xwiki.org: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/macro-reviews/commit/74c1f89c03482a2c79d4696b10f33ca84193fcfd  \n21:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you know who coded it btw?  \n21:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jerome it seems  \n21:35\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, Jerome  \n21:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(pinging him)  \n21:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(ok he's going to publish it)  \n21:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: I'm going to increase the value as well, back to 1M as it was after XTJETTY-6  \n21:54\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0OK?  \n21:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure but since I don't have time to check right now, fine\u2026. hope it doesn't have side effects (memory for sure at least)  \n22:00\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0vmassol: What component should I pick on Jira for xwiki-platform-tool-jetty-resources?  \n22:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0build, test and infra  \n22:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(at least that's where it is now I think - we could want to create a new component since it's runtime)  \n22:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm yes we should since build, test & infra is not supposed to be runtime  \n22:06\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:08\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n22:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:34\u00a0<qwebirc8919>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:35\u00a0<qwebirc8919>\u00a0cjdelisle: Still there? Sorry have my question formatted here. How would add a box of data to the right of a page, similar to how table of contents are listed in some of the documents, filled with data from an existing page?  \n22:58\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0back again  \n23:00\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0What you could do is create a page with the class sheet and include the page with the {{include}} macro  \n23:03\u00a0<qwebirc8919>\u00a0thats what I was thinking, but how do you specify you would want it to be just a small box, aligned. would that be formatting defined in the class sheet or on the page wanting to appear on?  \n23:06\u00a0<qwebirc8919>\u00a0did that make sense?  \n23:21\u00a0<qwebirc8919>\u00a0has quit  \n23:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n  \n{{/code}}\n"}
