I want to wait until 2.7 is branched and bring this in for 3.0 which will give me some time to work on dns-p2p :D  \ntmortagne - (12:16): sburjan: ok great  \nsburjan - (12:16): tmortagne: check 12:43 xwikibottext has joined  \nsburjan - (12:17): and you can see the 12:10 line where vmassol is coloured in evalica's line, but you can barely see it  \ntmortagne - (12:17): sburjan: actually what i mean is that it would be better if it was not highlighted  \ncjdelisle` - (12:17): oh btw, sburjan Mr. Network man, #dns-p2p@efnet, #dns-p2p-dev@efnet we're redesigning the internet.  \ntmortagne - (12:18): so that we see the difference between technical and real conversation  \nsburjan - (12:19): tmortagne: so joins, parts, quits shouldn't be highlighted ? Because if you want to do that, I have to change formatting on joins, quits, parts so the colourer won't get them  \nsburjan - (12:20): so basically we have to chose between 11:12 (first line) and 12:09 for example  \ntmortagne - (12:20): sburjan: i think it would be better yes, when it's not hilighted like at 11:18 you eyes just more easily over it  \nsburjan - (12:20): maybe I should send a new proposal  \ntmortagne - (12:20): s/just/jump/  \nvmassol - (12:21): sburjan: no need, just do whatever you think is best  \ntmortagne - (12:21): (in fact i would have prefered to not have it at all in the log)  \nvmassol - (12:21): I don't think we need to discuss this for too long....  \ntmortagne - (12:21): yep  \nsburjan - (12:21): vmassol: me neither, but I want to make everybody happy  \ntmortagne - (12:21): i suggest what i find better for me but if you are not convinced so whatever you feel is right  \ntmortagne - (12:22): s/so/do/  \ntmortagne - (12:22): it's already great like that  \nsburjan - (12:23): well not highlighting joins/parts would break the formatting consistency in those lines.

I'd have to look at the documentation to craft the correct query.  \ncjdelisle` - (19:16): The point is you can search for lists by their contents and it will be relitively fast.  \nMartinBryant - (19:17): ah I see that helps alot, i was curious as to what it did to the DB.. and if you have a moment i have another inquiry as well.  \ncjdelisle` - (19:17): sure  \nrrodriguez joined #xwiki at 19:17  \nMartinBryant - (19:17): I am trying to write a xwql query using the query manager to search of all pages given a specific tag... \u00a0at this point I can get all the pages that have tags, but i cant seem to limit the page list to a specific tag  \nMartinBryant - (19:18): my query currently looks like this:  \nMartinBryant - (19:18): #set($results = $services.query.xwql(\"from doc.object(XWiki.TagClass) as tagObj where tagObj.tag='Person'\").execute())  \nMartinBryant - (19:18): if I remove the where tagObj.... out i get the list of all the pages that have tags  \ncjdelisle` - (19:19): hmm. I'm not much of an expert on xwql.  \nMartinBryant - (19:19): sorry tagObj.tags\\* and i get a velocity error not an empty query  \nMartinBryant - (19:20): well how about HQL?  \ncjdelisle` - (19:20): I can do that a bit better.  \nMartinBryant - (19:20): at this point I just kind of need to prove that I can do it  \ncjdelisle` - (19:21): this is the schema mapping. When you are doing complex queries it is your best friend. http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/resources/xwiki.hbm.xml  \ncjdelisle` - (19:23): ok, if you have set tags to use relational storage then you will have to use a different query.  \nMartinBryant - (19:23): they are  \ncjdelisle` - (19:24): When did you make the change? I think tags which predate the change are not ported unitl they are saved again.  \nMartinBryant - (19:25): it was relational by default  \ncjdelisle` - (19:25): ok good.  \ncjdelisle` - (19:25): You want documents containing that tag right?  \nMartinBryant - (19:25): correct  \ncjdelisle` - (19:28): $xwiki.searchDocuments(\", BaseObject obj, DBStringListProperty prop where obj.name=doc.fullName and prop.id=obj.id and prop.list.value='Person'\")  \ncjdelisle` - (19:28): I'm not 100% on that prop.list.value  \nMartinBryant - (19:28): yea i was curious about that, I think i remember somewhere if multi select was on, list values were no longer a string type  \nMartinBryant - (19:29): and I couldnt remember the type or how to declare it  \ncjdelisle` - (19:30): I think if multi select is off, it's a string.  \ncjdelisle` - (19:30): If multi select is on, it's a largeString  \ncjdelisle` - (19:30): if relational is on, it's a DBStringListProperty  \nMartinBryant - (19:32): I appreciate it that has helped me more than you know.. sometimes i feel a bit in over my head..  \nMartinBryant - (19:32): sadly that query is not working and i think it may be that prop.list.value like you suggested  \njvdrean left at 19:33 (Quit: Leaving.  \ncjdelisle` - (19:33): I'm fishing through the hql documentation to see how to query elements in a list...  \nsabageru joined #xwiki at 19:33  \ncjdelisle` - (19:46): I think this is the query you're after:  \ncjdelisle` - (19:46): $xwiki.searchDocuments(\", BaseObject obj, DBStringListProperty prop where obj.name=doc.fullName and prop.id=obj.id and 'Person' in elements(prop.list)\")  \nMartinBryant - (20:07): thanks I will give that a try  \nMartinBryant - (20:09): that worked fantastic... thank you  \ncjdelisle` - (20:09): no pb  \nlucaa left at 20:46 (Ping timeout: 265 seconds  \nMartinBryant left #xwiki at 20:54  \nmbryant joined #xwiki at 20:55  \nflorinciu left at 21:16 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsabageru left at 21:18 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 21:24  \nvmassol left at 21:44 (Quit: Leaving.  \nmbryant left at 22:10 (Quit: KVIrc 4.0.2 Insomnia http://www.kvirc.net/  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 22:24  \nvmassol left at 22:29 (Quit: Leaving.  \nsdumitriu joined #xwiki at 22:34  \ncjdelisle` - (22:36): hah thanks for pointing out AutoCloseInputStream.
