Is there an manual how to configure the solor search page that it acts like the top right search?  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0kaisen: is it 1) that you prefer to the top right search results or 2) that you'd like to have the same results for both searches?  \n10:18\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a01. I want search suggestings under the search field 2) the same results :)  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: some interesting input for you :)  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's not the first time I hear users who'd like the same results for both searches  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and are puzzled when they don't get the same result)  \n10:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/for you/for us ;)  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know what are our options though  \n10:20\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:21\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0they are two different things for me. I don't have a solution either.  \n10:21\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:23\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0My Problem is that if someone enter a search work on the top and didn't type it fully out and press enter, the other search doesn't show anything until he write the full word or add a \\*  \n10:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0last time I checked google wasn't performing prefix matching, if you search for \"hou\" you won't get results for \"house\".  \n10:25\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0search suggest is one thing, and full text search is another thing  \n10:25\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0yes your right  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0what we miss is giving the user suggestion for search keywords  \n10:26\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0But on the top search it is like a \\* is add as soon as I have 3 character, on the other search I need to do it manually  \n10:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0so when you type \"hou\", we suggest you to search for \"house\", as google does  \n10:27\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Yes this would be also a nice feature  \n10:27\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yes, the top right search adds it (note that in the latest version this doesn't happen by default anymore, but we're going to get back to the original behavior most probably)  \n10:28\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0I use 6.0.1 and it seems to working for me  \n10:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0hmm, did you upgrade to 6.0.1 or is it a new install  \n10:29\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0upgrade  \n10:29\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0but my wiki seems to have anyway several problems :(  \n10:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0ok, that explains it, you must have the old search suggest sources, that still add the \\*.  \n10:30\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0anyway, we'll put back the \\* soon  \n10:30\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Ok in this case I don't care :)  \n10:33\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0But is there a chance to show the search suggest also on the normale solor search?  \n10:36\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n10:36\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n10:36\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:36\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Beacuse if you search in the top you get also shown attachments, but if you have enough other search results the go under in the results  \n10:41\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:44\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n10:57\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:06\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Ok I see were my problem \"comes from\". The filter which are set as default. If I want attachements I need to deactivate documents and activate attachemnts. Is there a way that documents and attachements are show as default?  \n11:17\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0kaisen: I think there is something to set in the Main.SolrSearchConfig ... checking  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0guys, I'd like your quick input on which API you prefer for the script user (this is for the new mail sender), see https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/f525b95644c6fd45b79b/raw/3ed770192f4c8afad4d743d1ba2570dd455e0ff0/gistfile1.txt  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vmassol/f525b95644c6fd45b79b/raw/d6950d5877c18c28deb5e6718088a53f9f7faf97/gistfile1.txt  \n11:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0I guess in variation 2 one does not need to pass in the message in $message,send($message) \u00a0;)  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0same question than ClemensR  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0and the line above too  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't really see why it's passing the $message  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes copy paste ;)  \n11:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0without the $message in parameter I prefer the variation 2  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ClemensR: any preference?  \n11:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if not exposing the XWikiMimeMessage in Variant 1 it would mean the service accepts an object-valued parameter and hat to check nobody passed in junk there, right ?  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0variant1 exposes XWikiMimeMessage which becomes a class just for the scripting api  \n11:25\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0if I have to use the interface I would prefer Variant 2 anyway  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oops  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I meant var 2  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in var 1, the api takes a MimeMessage param  \n11:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0people will try to use $message in variant 1 too I think anyway and modifying will break scripts  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my pref also goes for var 2 which is more natural \u2026 even though it forces a bigger difference between the java api and the scripting api  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok let's do var2  \n11:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0that could also be the Java API  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not nice for the java api  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw see http://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/MailModule  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in Java too it's nicer to directly manipulate an object than having to pass it to tons of APIs  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I much prefer to decouple and let java mail be exposed as much as possbile  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we can think about some shortcut api if we want but that's a different topic  \n11:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0just thinking that if we have to define an API anyway for the script we can use it in Java too  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I know I've had the same thoughts already  \n11:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes it can be a shortcut/helper  \n11:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0exposing java mail is very nice, but it does not prevent us from also providing some helpers  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, and we already do, for exemple MailSender is a shortcut, we still allow sending with pure javamail but this ones add some logic to handle non blocking mail sending + scheduler  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but yes after we've done the first version we'll need to decide if we want a larger helper  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that creates the session internally, etc like the scirpting api does  \n11:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0kaisen: I think if you edit Main.SolrSearchConfig in the wiki editor, you can look for 'facetQuery' \u00a0and change 'type':'DOCUMENT' to \u00a0\u00a0'type': ['DOCUMENT','ATTACHMENT'] .... that works for me. I hope it is a supported use case ;)  \n11:41\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0@ ClemensR thanks. I missed the [ ] which end up in macro error :)  \n11:42\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0ah, ok, yes, thats a bit tricky there  \n11:47\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0Maybe this should be standard that there is no filter set as it is confusing if you don't get all results  \n11:47\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0but if you get to much you can start to set filtres  \n12:09\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n12:16\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n12:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyone knows a Java lib providing API to do hierarchical locking ? (or maybe something I did not saw in Java 7)  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0locking for what?  \n12:25\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0is now known as <vmassol>  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh you mean concurrency and semaphores?  \n12:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you mean this domain: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html ?  \n12:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: no I don't mean concurrency and semaphore, I know this package  \n12:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I mean handling hierarchical locking in a tree, dealing with which nod should be locked when  \n12:30\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/nod/node/  \n12:49\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n13:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you want a concurrent tree (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11189784/efficient-concurrent-tree) ?  \n13:52\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:03\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:15\u00a0<D-Spair>\u00a0has quit  \n14:21\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: I'm not searching for a concurrent tree, I want something to handle locking for tasks that are going to modify stuff not in memory but thing that are organized in a tree. An example (which is not my use case but easy to understand) is having a object to manager access to a filesystem from various thread where you would want to modify sibling at the same time but where modification on a file should lock any of it's parent folder and the op  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/it's/its/  \n14:22\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(which is called hierarchical locking)

what's up?  \n16:50\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0is now known as <Denis>  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hi caleb  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0working on mail api with Lyes  \n16:50\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0yeah, did you have a problem with .fsattach.config ?  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw cjd did you see my comment on github about the property naming  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0?  \n16:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes I commented  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on your commit  \n16:51\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0just getting back to work, I spent the entire day at prefecture de police  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ouch not nice  \n16:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I referenced my comment in the jira issue too  \n16:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0idk I think fsattach is \"nicer\" because there is no generic filesystem module of which attachments is a submodule  \n16:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but I really don't care what color the bike shed is  \n16:52\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I don't understand your maven module  \n16:52\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0if it gets the bug fixed and ships to users I'm happy, as fast as that can happen is what makes me happiest :)  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could you explain why you have these 2 modules side by side:  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- xwiki-platform-store-filesystem  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- xwiki-platform-store-filesystem-attachments  \n16:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and why the later one is not a child of the former  \n16:54\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I can't remember  \n16:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0usually \"-\" are separator for child/ancestor  \n16:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so what you are saying is that they have no relationship of parent/child  \n16:55\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0filesystem looks like some generic tools for making fs access easier  \n16:56\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0./xwiki-platform-store-filesystem/src/main/java/org/xwiki/store/FileSaveTransactionRunnable.java <-- that's a 2 stage commit file saver which will revert if for some reason the db fails to commit related metadata  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok the store module looks a bit like a mess :)  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's a notion of filesystem but there's no notion of RDBMS  \n16:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's really strange  \n16:57\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0not at all  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should be there in the hierarchy  \n16:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I didn't need to store anything in RDBMS so why would I write it?  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we don't store documents in the DB???  \n16:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or attachments)  \n16:58\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that's done in oldcore :)  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oldcore is not future  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so we need to make way for the new apis  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you acknowledge that  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there are 2 types of store ATM  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a01) DB  \n16:59\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a02) FS  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it makes sense to have store.filesystem.something to make way for store.database.something  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no?  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what you implemented is only for the FS AFAIK  \n17:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and you only implemented storing attachments on the FS  \n17:00\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0mhm  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but shouldn't we allow in some future to also store documents on the FS as an option?  \n17:01\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or to some other storage)  \n17:01\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0no idea, hard to know if it would be useful  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I thought you were implementing the filesystem attachment store  \n17:02\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0not really, it's done  \n17:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally I'd have written: store.attachment.filesystem but you seems to have done instead: store.filesystem.attachment  \n17:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you wrote the attachment filesystem store  \n17:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0no, I did store.fsattach.  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's a property name, not a module  \n17:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0oh right  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the point is finding the property name based on the module  \n17:03\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0modules can be shuffled around later if needed  \n17:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as I've pointed out we have a very simple rule  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for naming properties  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(in the comment)  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it seems the hard part is agreeing that the module for which you wish a property is the Filesystem attachment store  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*property for  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie 3 concepts:  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- store  \n17:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- attachment  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- filesystem  \n17:05\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I think you're bikeshedding  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for some reason I don't understand you seem to think there's only 2 concepts  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- store  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- fsattach  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which could work  \n17:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's just not very scalable and different from everything else we do  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when we implement doc in DB we would have: dbdoc  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0store.fsattach, store.dbdoc, store.dbattach, etc  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a flater namespace  \n17:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0googling bikeshedding :)  \n17:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0one sec  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok nice word  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll remember it  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0learnt something today!  \n17:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes, 99% of api work is about bikeshedding  \n17:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://bikeshed.com/  \n17:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0it's worth a read  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0will do but I get the concept  \n17:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0because these kinds of api discussions did a horrific job on the freebsd community  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the problem is when you don't do anything instead of acting  \n17:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0IMO pick something, stick with it enough that a casual user can't spot inconsistancy and ship ship ship :)  \n17:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but thinking a bit is not counterproductive IMO  \n17:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it must not last too long  \n17:09\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0in 10 minutes it will have lasted as long as it took to write the patch  \n17:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not much compared to the cost we will hav eto pay to change the name  \n17:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0a config variable == you don't change it  \n17:10\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but if all fsattach is fsattach, store.rdbms is not \\*obviously\\* inconsistant  \n17:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it wouldn' tbe rdbms, it would be store.rdbmsattach :)  \n17:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0not if we don't do it that way  \n17:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0my point is the users will not notice if we have \u00a0\u00a0store.rdbms.someValue  \n17:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0and then on the other side we have store.fsattach.someConfig  \n17:13\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0nobody is going to notice a thing  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0especially since the store module will probably have to go away or be heavily refactored  \n17:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since it wasn't coded with the goal of being a replacement to the existing store  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so when we rewrite the existing store, the api will probably be different to take into account all store options  \n17:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if nobody disagrees with fsattach, we'll keep it and I'll go with the flow, hoping that you'll still be around if we need to change it ;)  \n17:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw this reminds me of a comment from ludovic  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that he would like us to join xwiki.properties and xwiki.cfg  \n17:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I'd be favorable to that  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it's too complex for users to have to look at 2 config files  \n17:16\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0+1  \n17:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and now the store config is split in 2 places  \n17:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Something I've noticed about windows kernel is it's incredibly stupendously well engineered  \n17:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so far we tried to have domains defined in either of the 2 files but not in both  \n17:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0designed by people smarter than me, the entire kernel is asynchronous which makes it like the only kernel in the world like that  \n17:17\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0but writing code to interact with it is impossible  \n17:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0whereas linux is basically a mountain of hacks but they're very fast hacks and writing code for it is really easy because the things you're most likely to do are streamlined  \n17:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0same story with solaris, brilliant beautiful design  \n17:18\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0takes 200 LoC to open a tun device which can be done in linux with 30  \n17:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0anyway I guess my point is embrase the ugly and make stuff which is really easy to use  \n17:19\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0:)  \n17:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sure it really boils down to why you code  \n17:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0personally I consider it an art and I'm trying to achieve perfection as much as possible  \n17:22\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I recognize your position  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0of course it's not possible in a not perfect world...  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n17:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Do you think I can convince you to read another piece of text when you get a chance?  \n17:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hehe  \n17:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0http://zedshaw.com/essays/master\\_and\\_expert.html <-- This had a bit of an impact on me as a programmer  \n17:24\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0that and a lot of pressure to ship ship ship and kill the bugs (in my project)  \n17:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0I guess the difference for me is now I don't really see anything as \"complete\" anymore.  \n17:25\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0It's beautiful, it's a beautiful construction site  \n17:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0oh yes it's never finished I agree about that  \n17:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:00\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0bye  \n18:01\u00a0<kaisen>\u00a0has quit  \n18:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bye  \n18:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has

the 6.1M2 release :)  \n18:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0who's the RM already?  \n18:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/guyes/guys  \n18:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne, mflorea: do you remember?

\n18:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0see above, (18:08:54) xwikibot: dev:ReleasePlans.ReleasePlan61M2 was created by xwiki:XWiki.mflorea - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleasePlans/ReleasePlan61M2  \n18:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I'll try to release tomorrow  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm I dont have this message, strange  \n18:17\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I have to go now  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: all committers are good?  \n18:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:18\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0on my side, I have a few small issues that I didn't had time to commit because I worked on File Manager, but nothing critical for 6.1M2  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n18:19\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n18:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0on my side it should be ok too, I have lots of stuff with @since 6.1M2 but I can change them for RC1 I guess  \n18:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0thx for the catch  \n18:27\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n18:42\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has

script service implementation. I need to figure out what's the best strategy for testing it now. After you commit the default mime body part factory for String we should have all the pieces to start making the integration test pass :)  \n19:42\u00a0<Lyes>\u00a0cool, I'll see it  \n20:04\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:04\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Hello, can all users in xwiki default install modify ui pages in the main space or spaces other than XWiki?  \n20:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends on the space  \n20:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for the Main space yes, the default permission allows editing those pages  \n20:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you can set the permission you wish  \n20:06\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I meant for example space blog, annotation code etc  \n20:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0depends  \n20:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why?  \n20:07\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I know that XWiki is not editable  \n20:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can set the permission you wish on a space  \n20:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex the Scheduler space is only editable by admins  \n20:08\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I've removed all right objects from the wiki to start from default permissions, but I know that default is view, edit, comment/etc for XWikiAllGroup so just excluding guests. I tried to edit Blog/Management as a guest after removing perms and it was allowed  \n20:09\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I didn't touch the blog space, just global perms  \n20:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you remove the default permissions then there's no more any default :)  \n20:09\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0And because all users are added to XWikiAllGroup then...  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I still don't understand what's your problem/question :)  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you want to know how to set up permissions?  \n20:10\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Withput any permissions, all users can view, edit and comment, I didn't touch specific spaces. but defaults for the wiki when I don't touch them is probably view, edit and comment for the wiki to XWikiAllGroup.  \n20:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's no such thing as \"default permission\", the permissions are defined by the rights objects  \n20:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0try starting your wiki with an empty DB for ex  \n20:12\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I know that a new wiki does not have any rights set. guests can view, edit and comment there, can't they?  \n20:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I don't remember, this may have changed now, let me give you the link to the doc on this  \n20:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security+Module  \n20:14\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I've actually read the docs, I should maybe reread this one again. What I'm actually asking about is a different thing: is it normal that any user having global edit can edit pages like Blog/Management? I could do \u00a0it as a guest when permissions were changed to all none for him, and defaults for XWikiAllGroup after installing the ui is allow edit.  \n20:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when no rights are set any user of the wiki (registered or not) used to be able to do anything (view, edit, admin pr, etc  \n20:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now Denis has modified the implementation and I don't remember if that's still the case or not  \n20:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0webczat: Blog.Management checks for admin right  \n20:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can edit it  \n20:16\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0It is what I'm asking. Can users do such things by default? I am changing my group layout slightly so I cannot currently check unless using a guest user.  \n20:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0#if($hasAdmin)  \n20:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now  \n20:17\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0Blog/Management checks for admin right when it is used. but not when it is edited I believe  \n20:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I do agree that this page is wrong IMO  \n20:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it should have a permission set on it  \n20:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since the blog space is not protected  \n20:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyone with edit right could change that page and remove the test  \n20:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm wait  \n20:18\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I tried once from guest. I didn't change anything but I was allowed to save.  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it probably does some checks later on  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for admin  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you're probably safe  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if it calls unrpoetcted api any user with edit rights could also call them :)  \n20:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it's ok  \n20:20\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0But any user with edit could ctrl+a and del the page :D  \n20:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure  \n20:20\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I know, I can change permissions  \n20:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but thaty's not a security risk  \n20:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0any user with edit right can do that on any page he can edit  \n20:20\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I can even reimport  \n20:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0import requires admin perm  \n20:20\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0and this one is not editable by default  \n20:21\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0but checking other things. No blog/ page is protected in any way  \n20:21\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I believe so at least  \n20:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure that's voluntary  \n20:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the problem?  \n20:22\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0I'm just not sure what is and is not protected, like annotation code probably isn't although I'm just trying to read xml  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok said differenty no page needs to be protected  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because all permissions checks are done at the java level  \n20:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so users can only do not dangerous things  \n20:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry I have to go, dinner time here!  \n20:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gl  \n20:25\u00a0<webczat>\u00a0what about protected api and issues?  \n21:14\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n21:26\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n22:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n22:33\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:54\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has quit  \n22:56\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:11\u00a0<tekzilla>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit\n"}
