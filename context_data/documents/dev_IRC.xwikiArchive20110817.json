Maybe we could sync  \n13:52\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:53\u00a0<pulasthi>\u00a0has quit  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0abusenius: good morning  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see someone added the following in AbstractTest: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0getUtil().recacheSecretToken();  \n14:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this causes the registration page to be loaded for each test  \n14:04\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0vmassol: hi  \n14:04\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0looking  \n14:07\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:10\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0vmassol: afaik setContext is only called at the beginning of a test run, when the server is started etc  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed it's called once  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I was running a single test  \n14:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it still is hard to understand why you'd have to go to the registration page  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that looks a bit circumvoluted just to get the token id  \n14:11\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0well, it always contains a secret token  \n14:11\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0yes  \n14:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0shouldn't we have a URL action to return the token instead?  \n14:12\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0no, that would make it too easy to circumvent  \n14:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but going to the registration page is the same  \n14:13\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0well, there we still need to parse the text, we cannot do anything about this, the token is included there anyway  \n14:13\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:13\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0and normally, extracting the secret token is not needed  \n14:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why do we do it?  \n14:14\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0because some of the tests are exploiting xwiki using csrf for efficiency and simplicity  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could also turn CSRF protection for the tests but it won't test it then\u2026.  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/turn/turn off/  \n14:15\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0I think the current solution is acceptable for testing purposes and does what it should  \n14:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually I could also create a new page with preview action and have $service.csrf.token() in it  \n14:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(not sure if it works, might need to save the page)  \n14:17\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0this methond is not always called with edit rights  \n14:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed  \n14:18\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0so we would need to create and save a page with the token so that it is visible for everyone  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0abusenius: why do we need to get the token only once in the test suite?  \n14:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0isn't it needed for each user that logs in?  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if the user isn't logged in the returned token will be useless right?  \n14:20\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0it is, this is the first initialization  \n14:20\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0it is recached when you relogin  \n14:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so why not get the token only in the login method?  \n14:21\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0and if noone is logged in, then the guest is logged in, who also has a token, which is not really useful  \n14:21\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0not all tests run as admin  \n14:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so there's a need for the csrf token even when not logged in?  \n14:21\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n14:22\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0well, to submit the login form  \n14:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see  \n14:23\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n14:23\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0it is not very useful, because everyone shares the token in that case, but still prevents some attacks to not public wikis  \n14:23\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0s/not public/private/  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0abusenius: why don't you recache in \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0public String getURLToLoginAndGotoPage(final String username, final String password, final String pageURL)  \n14:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0?  \n14:25\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0because it only returns the url to login  \n14:25\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0does not actually logs user in  \n14:25\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0the caller needs to decide which token he wants, before or after login  \n14:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0there's AndGotoPage  \n14:26\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0isn't it this xredirect thing?  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see you've added this in a page:  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0getDriver().get(getUtil().getURLToLoginAsAdminAndGotoPage(grasp.getURL()));  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0getUtil().recacheSecretToken();  \n14:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/page/test/  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes you're right, got it  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0getDriver().get() is the action  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the api is wrongly named...  \n14:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0misleading at least  \n14:28\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0yea, it is meant to be \"get URL to (login, then got to given page)\"  \n14:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm we could also compute the token  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(using DefaultCSRFToken for ex)  \n14:30\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0this method (and some other similar) are meant to do nasty optimizations with several xredirects  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that would be nice since we wouldn't need to do any navigation  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah the random would be missing I guess  \n14:30\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0private SecureRandom random;  \n14:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just looked at the code\u2026 ;))  \n14:31\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0we would need to access the instance used in the server :)  \n14:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0abusenius: ok thanks.

I was thinkning about renaming it in DB or doing some velocity script voodoo...  \n18:14\u00a0<jamesxu>\u00a0has quit  \n18:16\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:24\u00a0<pulasthi1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n18:26\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has quit  \n18:26\u00a0<arkub>\u00a0has quit  \n18:34\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:00\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:01\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n19:41\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:59\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:28\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has quit  \n21:03\u00a0<polx>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:33\u00a0<fmancinelli>\u00a0has quit  \n21:37\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n21:38\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:39\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0jvelociter: ping  \n21:41\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0abusenius: pong  \n21:41\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0re XWIKI-6784  \n21:42\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0I have a somewhat ugly fix locally, but I wonder whether there is some api to show confirmation to the user from ajax  \n21:42\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0abusenius: yes actually there is  \n21:43\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n21:43\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0there is XWiki.widgets.ConfirmedAjaxRequest or something like this  \n21:43\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0aha, interesting  \n21:43\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0where you can pass a confirmation message to a \"yes\" / \"no\" dialog  \n21:43\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0let me look it up  \n21:44\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0here you go : https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/master/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/resources/uicomponents/widgets/confirmedAjaxRequest.js  \n21:45\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0I could also just redirect to the standard confirmation page though  \n21:46\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0need to try it out  \n21:46\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:47\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0also another thing, is there something standard to pass more than the error code back to the ajax request in that case?  \n21:48\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0other than some hand-made json  \n21:48\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0the response body ?  \n21:48\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0yeah some crafted JSON I would say  \n21:48\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0nothing really standard I can think of  \n21:49\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0ok, I guess there was no need to pass back anything special to the ajax requests on errors  \n21:49\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0you can see an example of confirmedAjaxRequest in resources/js/xwiki/editors/dataeditors.js  \n21:49\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0I've seen that the body is displayed as is as the message  \n21:49\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0or resources/uicomponents/dashboard/dashboard.js  \n21:49\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0but I probably need a message and a url  \n21:50\u00a0<+abusenius>\u00a0ok, thx I'll take a look  \n21:51\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0cool  \n22:31\u00a0<qwebirc50962>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:32\u00a0<qwebirc50962>\u00a0hello All. quick question, i know its easy to change the logo and Skin, but is there anything built in to change that whole header?  \n22:33\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes, just modify and attach a different global.vm to your skin  \n22:36\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:36\u00a0<qwebirc50962>\u00a0Great! thank you for the quick response. checking into it right now! :)  \n22:36\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n22:36\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0is now known as <rrodriguez>  \n22:37\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0qwebirc50962: Read http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/DevGuide/Skins#HHowtooverrideaSkin  \n22:46\u00a0<qwebirc50962>\u00a0wait is that overriding a skin an alternative to changing the global.vm  \n22:47\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Because when you want to upgrade, you'll have to take care not to lose the global.vm that you modified  \n22:48\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0But if it's in a custom skin, you don't have this problem; the database documents stay in place during upgrades  \n22:49\u00a0<qwebirc50962>\u00a0okay I see what your saying  \n23:05\u00a0<qwebirc50962>\u00a0has quit  \n23:07\u00a0<pturcotte>\u00a0has quit  \n23:28\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:29\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0someone else has this error in eclipse, in some xwiki modules pom.xml file :  \n23:29\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0Project build error: Unresolveable build extension: Plugin org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-tool-xar-handlers:3.2-SNAPSHOT  \n23:29\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0?  \n23:30\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Nope  \n23:30\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0I have it in xwiki-platform-model for example  \n23:31\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0painful : it does not find any org.xwiki imports  \n23:42\u00a0<+jvelociter>\u00a0well.. fixed using mvn eclipse:eclipse and import a existing project  \n23:45\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n\n"}
