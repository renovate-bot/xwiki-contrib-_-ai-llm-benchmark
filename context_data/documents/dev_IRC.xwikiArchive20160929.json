You're the owner of it and I haven't analyzed it enough to know th erisk it represnets. I'm just asking you since I see quite a lot of code, code not done by an experienced xwiki dev, and for a fix that is not a blocker for LTS IMO. I'll let you take the decision  \n17:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0When I read the code, and when I test it (with different users on diffent wikis), it seems quite safe  \n17:29\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0However, side effects always come from places we never think about  \n17:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so, as you said, since it's not a blocker, I can let it for 8.4 only and let community/professional testers comfort this fix  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes a good strategy is to have it on master, wait a bit to make sure it's ok and then backport if need be  \n17:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(unless you're sure of yourself)  \n17:54\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n18:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:46\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n18:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah yes  \n19:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forget it  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n19:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0still trying to figure out hte prolem...  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems we have a problem on our ci  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project xwiki-platform-rendering-macro-context: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-macro-context:jar:8.4-SNAPSHOT: The following artifacts could not be resolved: org.xwiki.rendering:xwiki-rendering-syntax-event:jar:8.4-SNAPSHOT, org.xwiki.rendering:xwiki-rendering-test:jar:8.4-SNAPSHOT  \n19:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(when I execute locally)  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm that should work fine  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I see that the CI has built it  \n19:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-rendering/org.xwiki.rendering$xwiki-rendering-syntax-event/910/console  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forcing with )U  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0-U  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same problem  \n19:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking maven repo  \n19:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm seems ok : http://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots/org/xwiki/rendering/xwiki-rendering-syntax-event/8.4-SNAPSHOT/  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what.????  \n19:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshots/org/xwiki/rendering/ is empty for me  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so it seems we have a nexus problem  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking nexus logs  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0found it  \n19:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0java.lang.IllegalStateException: java.io.IOException: No space left on device  \n20:20\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:29\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:56\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:46\u00a0<blabla2[m]>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<Trefex\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:48\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n21:50\u00a0<Trefex>\u00a0has quit  \n21:50\u00a0<chaas\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n21:51\u00a0<chaas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:56\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:03\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:03\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:21\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n22:21\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n22:42\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0has quit  \n22:44\u00a0<daemoen>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:45\u00a0<aloisdg[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:04\u00a0<blabla2[m]>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:05\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:05\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit  \n23:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n23:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:40\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:43\u00a0<edvorg>\u00a0has quit\n"}
