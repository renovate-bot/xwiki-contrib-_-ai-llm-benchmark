Not good IMO.\"  \n09:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue is not that it's too big...  \n09:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0the issue is that it exist  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0those test should not fail in the first place  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0errr?  \n09:07\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then why have tests?  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if they always pass they're not needed  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0they're needed becuase they can fail  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0doyou mean  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that it's ok to have errors instead of failures?  \n09:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if they fail they should be fixed, the point of sonar is not to tall us we have filing tests  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/tall/tell/  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(error = build error, failure = the build worked but a test failed)  \n09:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if they don't fail sonar won't have a \"too big result to parse\"  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't think that the best way to indicate a failed tests  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is the issue is making the test smaller?  \n09:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what is the issue in making the image001.png much smaller?  \n09:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why would it make the test less good?  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0why is sonar parsing the test result in the first place ? we don't it to since we already have other tools to tell us about tests failures  \n09:10\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/don't it/don't need it/  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can ask them or read the sonar source code but it's much simpler to fix our test  \n09:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0also I don't see any harm in making our tests faster  \n09:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I don't really see what speed have to do here  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I'm leaving it in your hands  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0large file = slower  \n09:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0smaller file : faster  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0@thomas: I don't want to discuss, I want you to fix it, that's all  \n09:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I have things to finish first, then I will see what made this test fail since there was no change in confluence or filter module in a while  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0could be java8  \n09:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this our last error on ci (not talking about failures), I spent 2 days fixing the rest  \n09:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0fyi this is failing test on the normal platform build: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-filter-stream-confluencexml/2674/testReport/org.xwiki.filter.test.integration/FilterTest/confluencexml\\_4\\_3\\_2\\_test\\_\\_confluence\\_xml\\_\\_filter\\_xml\\_/  \n09:19\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:21\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: it does not look like ordering issue, probably some map somewhere  \n09:23\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/not//  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so indeed java8  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I fixed all unit tests but didn't look at integration tests  \n09:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for maps)  \n09:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0in this case it's good it failed since as far as I can see we don't import the pages in the same order that they are declared in the confluence package, even if I doubt there is any concept of order in the confluence export it's still nicer to follow the package order  \n09:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n09:31\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0merged on 8.0 and 7.4 too so that we see if the fix make it stable on any version of Java  \n09:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thx  \n09:38\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n09:41\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:41\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:42\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: when writing a job, it's the job writer's role to set the current user in the context or should that be done automatically by the job manager?  \n10:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(right now in WikiCreationJob the context user is null)  \n10:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: if by job manager you mean JobExecutor the answer is JobExecutor is a commons API :)  \n10:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes sure but we could have some platform abstact  \n10:05\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0so yes no standard, you need to pass the user in your request and set it yourself in your job  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so I guess gdelhumeau forgot to set it, I'll add it  \n10:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: any issue in setting the wiki owner as the context user in WikiCreationJob?  \n10:06\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't think so  \n10:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0yes we need to make sure to have a XWikiContext as standard as possible in all the jobs generating documents event (i.e. all the job modifying documents)  \n10:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Just take care that in the provisioning step, the flavor is installed with superuser  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I guess that the provisoning step will override it  \n10:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and put it back after  \n10:07\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0let me check  \n10:09\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0that should be ok: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/5a111a65a57ce8029449c188f26fc8f214cdfe8e/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-wiki/xwiki-platform-wiki-creationjob/src/main/java/org/xwiki/platform/wiki/creationjob/internal/ExtensionInstaller.java#L70-L70  \n10:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: in WikiCreationRequest what is ownerId? is it the reference to the owner user?  \n10:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so you start another job in the provisoning job step  \n10:15\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: ping  \n10:15\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it's serialized  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a serialized reference?  \n10:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why is it called id?  \n10:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0as ownerId is  \n10:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0does it mean it can contain something other than a ref?  \n10:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0in the future it could be a facebook user, or something else  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so in a future we'll need to go through a user api  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0got it  \n10:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(and change the code I'm adding)  \n10:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: it's an absolute ref?  \n10:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0yes  \n10:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm since it's a global user, I'll use a default resolver  \n10:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau, tmortagne: actually, do we want that the wiki descriptor page be authored by the wiki owner? or do we want to always force it to superadmin?  \n10:28\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't think it have an impact  \n10:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0being the author of the page give it right to modify it whatever the right are set  \n10:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw gdelhumeau, did you know that you save the descriptor twice in the wiki creation job?  \n10:30\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I remember something like that yes  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0once in the WikiCreationStep and then another time in the SaveWikiMetaDataStep  \n10:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seems a bit strange  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and there's no \"if\" in the save of the desqcriptor so the work is done twice  \n10:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0the first time is the descriptor itself  \n10:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and the second time, it's a WikiPropertyGroup  \n10:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: yes the question is whether we want the owner to have the rights to edit the descirptor  \n10:31\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0that could be saved anywhere actually  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: well saveDescriptor() is called 2 times  \n10:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(don't know what WikiPropertyGroup is)  \n10:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you're setting the deqcirtion, ownerid, etc again in the savemetadatastep  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually no  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0those are not set the first time apparently  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure why  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I know  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0my guess is that you implemented a step fro it  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then later realized that we actually need to have the descriptor  \n10:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0before the DB update  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so you created it before too without refactoring  \n10:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I simply reuse the WikiManager component  \n10:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0when you create a wiki it creates a descriptor  \n10:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and the save metadata step change them afterwards  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n10:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0anyway I'm not fixing this now  \n10:35\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and it have to be done after the provisioning  \n10:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0don't remember why  \n10:36\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0hmm no it's not  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: any take? I'm making the change now and I need to decide  \n10:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'll put the owner  \n10:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since he's the one who filled the wik metadata he should be able to change them later on I guess  \n10:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0right now owner sounds better to me  \n10:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw gdelhumeau lots of duplication in saveDescriptor and XWikiServerClassDocumentInitializer  \n10:40\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0you mean save descriptor recreates the class?  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0no  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mean code duplication  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0XWikiServerClassDocumentInitializer is not used much since the provisoning creates it  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's used only if someone deletes the descriptor  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in order to recreate it  \n10:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I guess)  \n10:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but I was mentioning that they both do similar stuff with code duplication  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok done, first BFD of the day for me ;)  \n10:51\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0Hello  \n10:55\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0I am working on an extension that is based on this task  \n10:55\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-12650  \n10:56\u00a0<M-mouhb>\u00a0I want your opinion to choose an appropriate name to the extension  \n11:00\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0XWikiServerClassDocumentInitializer creates \"XWiki.XWikiServerClass\" on the main wiki  \n11:01\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't see any duplication  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: descriptors are all created on the main wiki  \n11:05\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmmm  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed my bad we have 3 different things:  \n11:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- server class page creation  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- main wik descriptor page creation  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0- subwiki descriptor page creation  \n11:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I mixed server class page creation with subwiki descriptor page creation  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0second BFD!  \n11:17\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(thanks to Edy who left a duplicate for me to close ;))  \n11:24\u00a0<ujjwal>\u00a0has quit  \n11:30\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:32\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:49\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0Hi there :)!
