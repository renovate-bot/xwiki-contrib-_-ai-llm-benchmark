For ex you cannot just say \"chart\" whereas macro-chart has some meaning already (even if not good enough to differentiate from the existing chart macro). hmmm naming is always the hardest :)  \n16:44\u00a0<Lyes2>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n16:45\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:04\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:06\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n17:14\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has quit  \n17:17\u00a0<sdumitriu1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:27\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:28\u00a0<Lyes2>\u00a0has quit  \n18:01\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:03\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit  \n18:09\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:11\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n18:14\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:16\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n18:43\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:44\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:48\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n18:48\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n18:52\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:21\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n19:22\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n19:23\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has quit  \n19:36\u00a0<Lyes1>\u00a0has quit  \n19:43\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:46\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:53\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:56\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:58\u00a0<EA>\u00a0question: I\u2019m helping with a migration from a single wiki format to a multi-wiki tenancy. using MySQL and Tomcat. is the best course to preserve version history and comments as well as hierarchy/structure of a space\u2019s child pages to simply use the built-in export XAR feature and edit the program.xml files for each new wiki\u2019s subset of content?  \n20:58\u00a0<EA>\u00a0we are on XWiki v6.0.1  \n21:19\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n21:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n21:43\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:51\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:51\u00a0<EA>\u00a0think i figured out which was best.  \n21:52\u00a0<EA>\u00a0has quit  \n21:53\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n22:41\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:03\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n23:14\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:30\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n23:49\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:50\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit\n"}
