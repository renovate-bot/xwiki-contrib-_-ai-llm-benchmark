 \njvelociter - (10:48): I'm -1 to have JS in the XAR  \njvelociter - (10:48): (re your answer vmassol on the list vmassol )  \njvelociter - (10:48): as long as we don't have a proper way to upgrade applications, it's just too painful for everybody  \nvmassol - (10:49): acutally it's much better  \nvmassol - (10:49): sinc eotherwise you have a discrepancy  \njvelociter - (10:49): wdym?  \nvmassol - (10:49): if your platform doesn't match your app  \nvmassol - (10:49): it'll fail  \nvmassol - (10:49): as it happens all the time for Alldocs  \nvmassol - (10:49): and all code using livetables for ex  \nvmassol - (10:50): you can ceheck myxwiki.org for ex, 90% of all wikis are broken  \nvmassol - (10:50): because of that  \nvmassol - (10:50): (the AllDocs page fails because changes were made to something in the platform but the XAR not upgraded)  \njvelociter - (10:51): yes but that's probably because the livetable macros should not have been in the wiki in the first place  \njvelociter - (10:51): that was a ;istake  \njvelociter - (10:51): mistake  \nvmassol - (10:51): so if you bundle your app in a single place it cannot fail  \njvelociter - (10:51): annotations are different  \njvelociter - (10:51): anyway  \njvelociter - (10:51): they come enrich the UI  \njvelociter - (10:51): and we don't have UI extensions  \nvmassol - (10:51): I don't know the reqs for annotations  \njvelociter - (10:51): they are not really an application  \nvmassol - (10:52): all I'm saying is that we should try to keep it as separate as possible  \njvelociter - (10:52): and same for all docs  \nvmassol - (10:52): as we want to do for all apps  \njvelociter - (10:52): since we don't have a dependency mecanismn  \njvelociter - (10:52): I-m still -1 for this strategy for now. not on the principle, bu ton the realization until we have a proper app manager  \nvmassol - (10:52): ideally it would be a single XAR, if it can be XAR + java for now it would be great, if it needs XAR + java + resources it's ok but a bit less good  \njvelociter - (10:53): for example :  \nvmassol - (10:53): the more parts the \u00a0more problems  \njvelociter - (10:54): Well I don't agree  \njvelociter - (10:54): (again, not on the principle)  \nvmassol - (10:54): sure that's your right but you need to explain  \nvmassol - (10:54): please reply to the mail  \nsdumitriu - (10:55): I don't like applications that depend on the monolithic web/standard/templates  \nsdumitriu - (10:55): It's hard to manage issues  \nvmassol - (10:55): yes and it's not the direction we want to have  \njvelociter - (10:55): we are talking about resources/ here  \nsdumitriu - (10:55): Fixing a bug requires changes in an application and in the core  \njvelociter - (10:55): rather  \nvmassol - (10:55): now maybe for perf reasons it's needed, I have no idea about that  \nsdumitriu - (10:56): Yep, /resources or /templates, it's the same place  \njvelociter - (10:56): well, people do not upgrade their XARs, so in the end bugs do not get fixed at all  \njvelociter - (10:56): if you fix bugs only in applications  \njvelociter - (10:57): (they don't upgrade because it's too complicated/dangerous/painful)  \njvelociter - (10:57): (not because they are lazy)  \nvmassol - (10:57): I don't agree  \nvmassol - (10:57): what is hard is to upgrade pages you modify  \nvmassol - (10:57): upgrading a \"close\" app is easy  \nvmassol - (10:57): and in any case  \nvmassol - (10:57): it's better that people are not forced to upgrade  \njvelociter - (10:58): yes but you have to do all the work of filtering out what you have modified  \nvmassol - (10:58): which is the case if you put stuff in resources/  \njvelociter - (10:58): that make it painful  \nvmassol - (10:58): so you like it when all wikis suddenly fail on myxwikiKorg?  \nvmassol - (10:58): because we''ve upgraded the platform  \nEnygma` joined #xwiki at 10:58  \nvmassol - (10:58): It's much better not to have the latest app  \nvmassol - (10:58): but that the one you have keeps working  \njvelociter - (10:59): with bugs  \njvelociter - (10:59): anyway I understand your point  \nsdumitriu - (11:00): Well, the conclusion here is: No Hard Dependencies between Documents and Resources  \njvelociter - (11:00): I'm not fully convinced  \nvmassol - (11:00): yes  \njvelociter - (11:00): yes that I agree  \nsdumitriu - (11:00): Either all in files, either all in documents  \njvelociter - (11:00): but wrt annotations their should be only resources I imagine  \nsdumitriu - (11:00): So, lucaa, can you make the annotations only from resources?

I'm not really convinced since we could control over JAR + resources/ which are always in sync, but I'm not opposing the XAR  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:09): I think it's be really cool if an xar could bring in a jar. \u00a0\"install the plugin then install the application\" is not cool to ask the admins to do.  \nvmassol - (11:10): the resources/ are not used by the jar but by the XAR jvelociter (AFAIU)  \njvelociter - (11:10): no  \nvmassol - (11:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: see http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Design/ExtensionManager  \njvelociter - (11:10): if we go for resources/ their is not XAR  \nvmassol - (11:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: it's not easy at all  \nsdumitriu - (11:10): CalebJamesDeLisl: It's possible to use an attached jar from Groovy  \nvmassol - (11:10): it requires dynamic classloading  \nvmassol - (11:10): sdumitriu: that doesn't work too well right now, would need some improvement and verify it really works on memory  \njvelociter - (11:11): and they are in sync meaning the JS correspond to the REST API for example  \nvmassol - (11:11): I mean it works but for an industrial usage it requires some work (+ the fact that it needs PR)  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:11): Yes I read the irc bot. It should be streamlined, I didn't know it was in the IX plan.  \nvmassol - (11:12): not IX but extension manager  \nvmassol - (11:12): basically it requires using osgi  \nvmassol - (11:12): so guice + peaberry probably  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:13): Ahh so many extensions, missed that one. re xar format: Awesome!  \nanamarias joined #xwiki at 11:15  \nbblfish - (11:17): the last developer build of chrome now has fixed the last serious issue of client side certs http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/  \nbblfish - (11:17): fixed http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37765  \nxenon75 left at 11:19 (Ping timeout: 240 seconds  \nlucaa - (11:26): jvelociter: are all jss and csss in the resources overwritable?  \nlucaa - (11:27): as in, could a dev add things to the .js from the wiki?  \njvelociter - (11:27): you mean by eternal applications ?  \njvelociter - (11:27): well you can always not load them  \nlucaa - (11:27): i mean by an xwiki app developer  \njvelociter - (11:27): and load something else instead  \nsdumitriu - (11:27): If you design the classes well, you can override them at runtime  \njvelociter - (11:27): or you \u00a0can load them and rewrite them  \njvelociter - (11:27): yes  \nsdumitriu - (11:27): You can't just replace the whole file  \njvelociter - (11:27): (at least the JS)  \nlucaa - (11:27): I don't want to overwrite classes  \nlucaa - (11:28): I want to have the same capacity of going to a page, and changing a bit of js to make it custom  \njvdrean left at 11:28 (Quit: Leaving.  \nlucaa - (11:28): (as we have with jsx)  \nlucaa - (11:29): otherwise customizing is going to be a pain and I've been trying to avoid it  \nlucaa - (11:30): and how about macros, annotation macros? Right now they're all in a wiki page which one can easily change if they want to make it custom  \nlucaa - (11:31): when they'll be in resources they would be in, I guess, macros.vm, which makes it a pain to change something  \nlucaa - (11:31): unless I get a special annotationmacros.vm only for myself  \njvelociter - (11:48): FYI I have NPE in my logs at  \njvelociter - (11:48): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0at com.xpn.xwiki.doc.XWikiDocument.addXObject(XWikiDocument.java:2086)  \nanamarias - (11:49): hi  \nanamarias - (11:49): I have a method that reads from an xls file (actully a xwiki Attachment) received as parameter; it uses the org.apache.poi hssf library to do that and reads the rows, info in the cells etc.  \nanamarias - (11:49): \u00a0I would like to test it.

Is it an implementation just similar to saveWithProgrammingRights, just checking edit rights on the contentAuthor and calling the protected saveDocument() ?  \nsdumitriu - (11:52): If that \"not supposed to\" is strong, then add an assert()  \ntmortagne - (11:53): sdumitriu: if you do that you get nullpointer like in maney standard java api  \nanamarias - (11:53): lucaa: the method needs to identify correctly the header of a table inside, and the table might have empty columns, empty rows at the beginning etc. So I'll need several such XLS for testing  \nsdumitriu - (11:53): Well, standard Java API documents the NPE  \ntmortagne - (11:53): testing it each time takes unecessary time  \nsdumitriu - (11:53): So users know about it  \ntmortagne - (11:53): and it should be documented  \nsdumitriu - (11:53): Is it documented on our side?  \ntmortagne - (11:53): there is no javadoc currently  \ntmortagne - (11:54): yes  \ntmortagne - (11:54): but i'm finishing the clone first  \nlucaa - (11:54): anamarias: ok, so it's about the content of the .xls. You should isolate the function processing it, and call it for files read from the \u00a0test resources . You can have more xlss in the test resources  \nCalebJamesDeLisl - (11:54): Denis: That is correct, I don't like using programming rights unless absolutely necessary but still need to edit documents from my script which the viewer should have no right to touch.  \nanamarias - (11:55): lucaa: how do I read from files located in the test rsources?  \nsdumitriu - (11:56): classloader getResourceAsStream  \nvmassol - (11:57): I have to go to solutions linux to present xwiki, bb around 7PM I guess  \nDenis - (11:57): CalebJamesDeLisl: ok, thanks for confirming that, I answer on the list...  \nvmassol left at 11:59 (Quit: Leaving.  \nvmassol joined #xwiki at 12:00  \njvdrean joined #xwiki at 12:03  \njvelociter - (12:03): anamarias: getResourceAsStream.
