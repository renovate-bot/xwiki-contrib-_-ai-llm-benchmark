(I just did a stock install following the instructions)  \n14:28\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:31\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0taking a look... I'm not familiar with the workspace manager application but usually the way it works is there are document bundles which add additional translations and they need to be referenced from the XWikiPreferences document.  \n14:32\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0ok, that could be connected - the \"testwiki\" was created with a template that XEM installed  \n14:32\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0templatexe, I believe  \n14:32\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0maybe it didn't have the required properties in it?  \n14:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It should only be required that the document bundle is referred to in the main wiki.  \n14:38\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://viper7.dzone.com:8080/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/Translations <-- this is the document bundle.  \n14:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0oops, that's the wrong one  \n14:39\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I was confused :)  \n14:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0http://viper7.dzone.com:8080/bin/view/WorkspaceManager/Translations  \n14:39\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0that one  \n14:40\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0ok, cool - so the properties are definitely there, but somehow they are not referenced  \n14:40\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0From the administration interface in your main wiki, try going to the \"Localization\" tab and check to see WorkspaceManager.Translations is included in the \"INTERNATIONALIZATION DOCUMENT BUNDLES\" field.  \n14:41\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0(sorry for yelling, copy/paste)  \n14:41\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0thx, I will try to do that now (it is all still quite unfamiliar to me)  \n14:42\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0here's the list of bundles it has presently  \n14:42\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0XemResources.Translations,WikiResources.Translations,XAppResources.Translations, WorkspaceManager.Translations  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0rickross: edit the http://viper7.dzone.com:8080/bin/view/WorkspaceManager/Translations document, probably mean it's actually a include of the one in main wiki  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0this has been fixed but maybe only in 3.3.1  \n14:43\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0checking  \n14:46\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0tmortagne, the strings in question appear to be present in the main wiki document, but the (child?) wiki \"testwiki\" doesn't seem to see them  \n14:47\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0what is the preferred term to describe spawned wikis in an XEM farm?  \n14:51\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0We usually call them subwikis.  \n14:51\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0rickross: include is not supported with translations so that's why I asked you if http://viper7.dzone.com:8080/bin/view/WorkspaceManager/Translations was included  \n14:52\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there used to be the issue with apmanager and wikimanager fixed in 3.3 as far as i can see but maybe workspaces has the same kind of issue  \n14:53\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0tmortagne, I'm still getting my feet wet, so I may not have understood the question? Am I supposed to check if the mainwiki WorkspaceManager.Translations is referenced by inclusion in the subwiki?  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0nop  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0go to the page in the subwiki  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0edit it in wiki mode  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0and see if the translation are really here or if there are included (include macrp)  \n14:53\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/macrp/macro/  \n14:53\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0ahh, ok  \n14:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0just found that there is supposed to be a WorkspaceManager.TemplateTranslations too it seems so maybe the real issue if that WorkspaceManager.TemplateTranslations is not listed in XWikiPreferences  \n14:55\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0\"Various translations that are used in the workspace template and, implicitly, in the created workspaces\"  \n14:56\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0how did you created the wiki ?  \n14:57\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I used XEM to create a new wiki  \n14:57\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and filled in the form  \n14:57\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I can give you an account with admin rights if you would like to step through to see if it is a bug  \n14:58\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I cannot find a document in the subwiki that looks anything like WorkspaceManage Translations in the mainwiki  \n14:59\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0there is several way to create wiki since 3.3 actually that's why I'm asking, there is the old WikiManager.CreateNewWiki and the new UI to create workspaces and maybe you are supposed to use the proper UI for workspace to be properly created  \n15:00\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0ok, I am getting terms confused again - I thought a Space equals a Workspace, which I understood to be a subsection of a Wiki  \n15:00\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0so I clicked \"Create a new wiki\" - possibly from the old interface  \n15:01\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the new \"Workspace\" in 3.3 is technically a subwiki but in which the fact that it's actually a separated wiki is a bit hidden  \n15:01\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I would not have giessed that Workspace = Wiki  \n15:01\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0guessed  \n15:02\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0it is confusing, since each wiki also has SPaces  \n15:02\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I will destroy that testwiki and make a new one with \"Create a new Workspace\"  \n15:03\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if what you want is a simple XE as subwiki you can create a new wiki without choosing any template with the old UI and then import a XE xar in it  \n15:04\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can then make this new wiki a wiki template to create new wikis from this one or always to the import  \n15:04\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0http://viper7.dzone.com:8080/wiki/testwiki/view/Main/WebHome  \n15:04\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0the problem is not present on this new subwiki  \n15:05\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok so it probably mean that when you create workspace some more is done after the wiki creation (don't know it very well)  \n15:05\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0hmm, good idea - we would probably preconfigure a base template that is ready to use for our anticipated use case  \n15:06\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0my deeper goal is to understand if I can achieve good integration with a Q&A solution DZone has built?  \n15:06\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0so we'd want to automate this stuff 100% , if possible  \n15:07\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n15:08\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0as far as I know workspaces goal is to make easier to create wiki on demand for users that are not main wiki admins and allow them to setup users allowed to acces their workspace (so their wiki) etc...  \n15:09\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0very cool  \n15:09\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I suspect that integrating with our AnswerHub system will require a lot of limiting the visibility of admin options  \n15:09\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0well, merging the admin into our core admin  \n15:10\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but that's pretty far down the road - I am just trying to get a clear sense of what is possible  \n15:10\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:10\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0probably but since most of the UI, admin included, is in wiki pages you can easily chhose which pages you want in your template  \n15:10\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0tmortagne, do you recommend installation of Admin Tools with XEM?  \n15:10\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0ahh, beautiful  \n15:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you mean the admin tool on extensions.xwiki.org ?  \n15:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0s/on/from/  \n15:11\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0everything is really just wiki pages at some level, so if the template is modified, the admin access would no longer be present  \n15:11\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0yes, that is the one  \n15:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I don't know it very well but if you are using MySQL it's supposed to be pretty useful  \n15:11\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you don't use MySQL it's unusable I think  \n15:11\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I just put it in (I was lazy and didn't want to go make the mysql indexes :)  \n15:12\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0note that the mysql indexes are supposed to be automaticlaly created now  \n15:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0since 3.2 I think  \n15:12\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0aha  \n15:12\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0thanks to new hibernate version  \n15:15\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:15\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0drat, I was hoping that lack of indexes would explain why I am seeing slow performance on the main dashboard pages  \n15:16\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0it is taking up to 5+ seconds to produce these pages for some reason  \n15:16\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0http://viper7.dzone.com:8080/wiki/testwiki/view/Main/WebHome for example  \n15:17\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0this is a fast dual quad-core Xeon machine with loads of ram  \n15:17\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and there's nothing else running on it  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0the activity dashboard it's not very good, we need to improve it  \n15:17\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and there's nearly no wiki content (except what came included with XEM)  \n15:17\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0http://viper7.dzone.com:8080/wiki/testwiki/view/Main/AllDocs is much quicker for example  \n15:18\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0yes, the other pages are very snappy  \n15:18\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0most all of them  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in any case even without index with no wiki content that should not change much I think  \n15:18\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0so I hoped an index was missing on the homepage queries  \n15:18\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0index changed the speed a lot when it's starting to contain lots of content I think  \n15:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0if you really need this dashboard you could cache it using rendering cache or cache macro  \n15:19\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0until we improve it  \n15:19\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0nope - I don't need it too much  \n15:19\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I was just trying to get a feeling for whether I had installed correctly for good performance  \n15:20\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I'm just a noob exploring :)  \n15:20\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0still feel pretty long even for activity dashboard  \n15:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0it's that \"first impression\" thing  \n15:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0since that is the default page for the wiki  \n15:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0it won't satisfy the guys who expect sub-second page response  \n15:21\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep it's not very cool right now  \n15:22\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0everyone on my end will be comparing to Confluence  \n15:22\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and \"Confluence this..

 \n15:56\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0well, that didn't have the expanded link on the page  \n15:57\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0it was correct text, linking \"Admin\"  \n15:57\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but how can Admin not have sufficient rights?

 \n16:08\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Is it still showing up?  \n16:09\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I think a bug issue is in order but I would like to understand what caused the translations not to be applied despite being referenced from the main wiki.  \n16:12\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0editing and saving the various pages from within the subwiki cleared the symptom  \n16:12\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but I suspect that if I create another subwiki, it'll start off wrong again  \n16:12\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I will test now  \n16:13\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The issue with workspacemanager.menu.mainwiki.admin showing up was fixed?  \n16:13\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0when I created the subwiki with \"Create a new workspace.\" on the main wiki dashboard, that translation was properly included  \n16:14\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh so it was resolved.  \n16:14\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I used some other link to create the first subwiki, and it was untranslated when I did it that way  \n16:14\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I don't remember what other link it was - probably the one from the referenced old manager page  \n16:15\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0one of the nice things is you can script all of this and just have one button.  \n16:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0one of the not-so-nice things is supporting older code means a number of APIs doing the same things.  \n16:16\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I don't know if you can access this  \n16:16\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0http://viper7.dzone.com:8080/wiki/apptest/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=Invitation  \n16:16\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I can't.  \n16:17\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I made a new workspace, and the config page is showing the same message as the first one did  \n16:17\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0let me check if Admin user is there.  \n16:17\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but if I edit and save the referenced pages, I think it will work  \n16:18\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0there is no Admin user so either you need to add the Admin user back to the template you are using or resave those documents in the template.  \n16:19\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I believe that template was the original provided by XEM 3.3  \n16:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh, there is a bug.  \n16:20\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0btw, should I have installed this from svn instead of from the .war download?  \n16:20\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0The .war should be the most stable.  \n16:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0that missing Admin is affecting thre apps: Annotation, Invitation and Search  \n16:21\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0all three have the same symptom  \n16:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0There will be others as well such as the document livetable for attachments.  \n16:22\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0removing Admin user from the template was a mistake that has been fixed now I think  \n16:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0hmm maybe not actually  \n16:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0in any case the user is removed on purpose by workspaces  \n16:23\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0(wrong purpose IMO)  \n16:24\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0ahh, so this is a feature :)  \n16:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0heh  \n16:24\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0could say that  \n16:26\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0anyway it probably worth a jira issue, whatever the way it's fixed part of the workspace admin is unusable it seems  \n16:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0indeed, I can think of a few other places which will have trouble, eg: attachments livetable.  \n16:27\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0these have trouble anyway because they need programming right, having a local admin user will not help much  \n16:28\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0ahh I see  \n16:28\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0all this was supposed to be fixed by http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7298 but it has been vetoed  \n16:28\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0it's not SOOO terrible to have to edit and save those pages, but as a noob admin I wouldn't have known that was what I needed to do  \n16:28\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0rickross: yep it's a bug, this should not be required  \n16:29\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0IMO, everything in the default admin sidebar should work in a new workspace, by default  \n16:29\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0I agree  \n16:29\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0do you guys prefer apache or nginx as a front-end webserver?  \n16:30\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I don't think I'll leave it just running on Tomcat  \n16:30\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0we usually use apache but I could not explain you why, I don't know nginx very well  \n16:31\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I don't know nginx either - apache is familiar  \n16:31\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but, since I am exploring, I may as well try out nginx, too :)  \n16:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0Another option in the \"faster\" direction is lighttpd, a friend of mine swears by it.  \n16:32\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0But then I don't know webservers very well myself.  \n16:32\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0we do a \"multi-tenant, multi-site\" approach to hosted Q&A in our Java solution, and I wonder how that can integrate with xwiki?  \n16:33\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0xwiki appears to be making a new database for each subwiki  \n16:33\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0It does.  \n16:34\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0so federated user management isn't going to be easy, I guess?  \n16:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0you can share user accross all wiki by putting them on main wiki  \n16:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that usually what we do in a farm  \n16:34\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0like xwiki.org for example  \n16:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you wish you can have all the users created on the main wiki or use another auth like ldap  \n16:35\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0nice  \n16:35\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0so, we could somehow export the auth to our core app's user management, anyway?  \n16:36\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but we could hit limits of open tables and files if we tried to put too many subwikis on a single system  \n16:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep, you can create you own XWiki auth which authenticate on you own based sync xwiki users on main wiki  \n16:36\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0that's what we ddo with LDAP generally  \n16:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rickross: at some point we had a farm with over 10K wikis on it  \n16:36\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I'm not sure it'll matter much - the actual use cases we have encountered for customers are different than what we originally imagined  \n16:37\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0so we might make wiki integration an option for the higher-end customers  \n16:37\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0but I really love the idea of wiki integration with Q&A  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'd love to see that too :)  \n16:38\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and I know you guys do wiki better thanwe ever will  \n16:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(as we had discussed)  \n16:38\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and we do Q&A pretty well :)  \n16:38\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0it would be cool to migrate your FAQ into our system  \n16:38\u00a0<+tmortagne>\u00a0yep  \n16:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yup  \n16:41\u00a0<CIA-123>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f feature-extension-versions\u000f \\* rcd8baf4\u000f \u000f/ (1123 files in 54 dirs):\u000f Merge branch 'master' into feature-extension-versions ...  \n16:42\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I'm sorry this didn't move forward earlier - the two guys I had assigned this to spent time and produced nothing, but they were moaning about having problems installing and all kinds of stupid complaints  \n16:42\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0and I really didn't believe them, so when I had time over the holidays I decided to try it myseld  \n16:42\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0myself, and it was totally easy to setup (well, not totally, but pretty easy)  \n16:43\u00a0<rickross>\u00a0I'm sure they just didn't follow your instructions carefully (which really annoys me)  \n16:43\u00a0<CIA-123>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* rfd8819b\u000f \u000f/ (26 files in 11 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7337: Implements Searchable in local and core extensions repositories ...  \n16:43\u00a0<CIA-123>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* rf1b20a7\u000f \u000f/ (6 files in 3 dirs):\u000f XWIKI-7340: Return total hits in versions and extensions REST requests ...  \n16:43\u00a0<CIA-123>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* rd491502\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-extension/xwiki-platform-extension-repositories/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-xwiki/xwiki-platform-extension-repository-xwiki-handler/src/main/java/org/xwiki/extension/repository/xwiki/internal/XWikiExtensionRepository.java :\u000f XWIKI-7240: Add support for special versions qualifiers and version ranges ...  \n16:43\u00a0<CIA-123>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* rcd8baf4\u000f \u000f/ (1123 files in 54 dirs):\u000f Merge branch 'master' into feature-extension-versions ...  \n16:43\u00a0<CIA-123>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* r10240b6\u000f \u000f/ (142 files in 38 dirs):\u000f Merge branch 'feature-extension-versions' - http://git.io/eLnvSA  \n16:44\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n16:46\u00a0<CIA-123>\u00a0tmortagne\u000f master\u000f \\* ra1fc28b\u000f \u000f/ xwiki-enterprise-installers/xwiki-enterprise-installer-debian/pom.xml :\u000f XE-1074: Upgrade to jdeb 0.9 - http://git.io/WH25-Q  \n16:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rickross: ok\u2026 it could be easier to install for sure but it's not that hard and there's the forum and irc to help.
