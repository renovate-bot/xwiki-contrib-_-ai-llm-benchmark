:)  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*options  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well even if you had you'd probaby have 2 anyway  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since these extensions have to be installed in 2 different wikis  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so won't work...  \n10:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0indeed your case is a bit special  \n10:47\u00a0<Pbas>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0there is a bit if UI (even if not the kind of UI you go to explicitly) and there will be configuration UI at some point probably but yes won't really make one more important than the other  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0replied to your mail thomas  \n10:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for category I'd put \"Others\"  \n11:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm the AS is strange tmortagne: it says you created some radeox pages that I renamed (see http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/News) I guess this is because of the copy bug that keeps the author  \n11:49\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's funny: you supposedly created the pages but it's me who deleted them (rename=copy/delete)  \n13:10\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: we need to introduce events for copy and move so that AS store more meaningful activity in a case like this (plus we need those events for other use cases anyway)  \n14:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0does anyone still have anything blocker for 8.2M1 ?  \n14:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ci.xwiki.org looks ok enough so I will start the release ASAP  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you have some missing documentation  \n14:14\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0http://jira.xwiki.org/issues/?jql=Project%20in%20%28%22XWiki%20Commons%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Rendering%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Platform%22%2C%20%22XWiki%20Enterprise%22%29%20and%20fixVersion%20in%20%28%228.2-milestone-1%22%29%20and%20resolution%20in%20%28%22Fixed%22%29%20and%20%28%28Documentation%20is%20EMPTY%29%20or%20%28%22Documentation%20in%20Release%20Notes%22%20is%20EMPTY%29%29  \n14:14\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: sure, but there's still a problem with copy. It says that you created the page but I don't understand why: http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Old+XWiki+1.0+syntax+renderer/Chart+Macro+%28Radeox%29?viewer=history&showminor=false&firstIndex=0  \n14:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you were not even the creator of the page.

I don't consider this jira extension id change to be a major change that's worth being on the summary page  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0TBH I've documented the new URL serializer/parser too in the RN but that could have been skipped for the same reason I guess  \n15:04\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it's important that is is in the reference doc though)  \n15:06\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: you forgot to remove the dependencies on markdown in rendering integration test project  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah grrrr  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we didn't see it because we don't clean local repo on ci?  \n15:06\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*repos  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0when I move a project I usually try to remove its snapshots in nexus so that anyone looking at the old id fail  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n15:07\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's not a local repository issue  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes it's snapshot repo  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which has a clean  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but it keeps the last one for a long time surely  \n15:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't remember how long  \n15:08\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0vmassol: markdown was not move a long time ago anyway :)  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0well the time we keep snapshots is 1 day  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(just checked)  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so not long  \n15:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we also keep a minimum of 1 snapshot\u2026  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0forever it seems  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ah no  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have a second rule  \n15:09\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no not forever AFIK  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0120 days  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so every day till ther's only 1  \n15:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and then 120 days to remove that one  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm  \n15:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: any idea why we had a dependency on MD there?  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0since I don't think it was used in the tests  \n15:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I hope not)  \n15:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0no idea, never worked on markdown  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the integration tests pass?  \n15:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(without it)  \n15:12\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:12\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0they pass, from what I remember at some point all test were in that project  \n15:13\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe markdown that there back in those days  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0maybe  \n15:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0good if they pass  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0nice, ~/restart-release.sh does not seems to work anymore...  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok works now  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I think I used it not long ago  \n15:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0k  \n15:23\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:52\u00a0<acotiuga>\u00a0has quit  \n16:57\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0[release] git/maven release done  \n17:07\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has quit  \n17:43\u00a0<KermitTheFragger>\u00a0has quit  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n17:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n17:54\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n18:04\u00a0<vmassol1>\u00a0has quit  \n18:08\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:11\u00a0<fitz>\u00a0has quit  \n18:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n18:15\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n18:29\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:03\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n19:04\u00a0<ansuz>\u00a0has quit  \n19:06\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n19:16\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n19:44\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0has quit  \n20:02\u00a0<boubou>\u00a0has quit  \n20:10\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n20:10\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n20:11\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:40\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n20:41\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:41\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:10\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:10\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n22:11\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n22:42\u00a0<lkrejci>\u00a0has quit  \n23:16\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n23:32\u00a0<woshilapin>\u00a0has quit  \n23:38\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has quit\n"}
