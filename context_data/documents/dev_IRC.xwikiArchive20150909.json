the homepage of the app that was generated doesn't display correctly?  \n09:39\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0no, I'm writing a script to send an email  \n09:40\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0where the message has the content of the page  \n09:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what's the relationship with AWM?  \n09:40\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0I'm trying to get the content of a page generated by the AWM.  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically you're writing sharepage by email, right?  \n09:41\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0yes, exactly, but a with a few customizations  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0btw does it work if you share your AWM page by email using the standard share button?  \n09:41\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0sorry for not being clear  \n09:41\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0yes it does  \n09:42\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0I can't seem to get the content from the object attached to the page using getRenderContent  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes $doc.getRenderedContent() will render the page content in view mode  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0getRenderedContent() renders the content of the page  \n09:42\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0how does the share by email get all the content from the object then :O  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0basically it does the same as when you view the page  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the page content has script  \n09:43\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0oh really?  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that script executes  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and does whatever it does  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it could extract data from xobjects, call apis, etc  \n09:44\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0where is this script?  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0go to a page and edit it  \n09:44\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and if you don't see anything you need to understand the concept of sheets, see http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Sheet+Module  \n09:45\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0ok  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0each page is responsible for displaying its content  \n09:46\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0when I edit it, it goes into...inline form ..mode?  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0edit in wiki mode  \n09:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(see http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/PageEditing )  \n09:47\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0oh I see what you mean  \n09:47\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0the code to display is in the class sheet...  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yes  \n09:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(probably, I don't know your page)  \n09:49\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0ok  \n09:50\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0so a page from awm, is using a class sheet to display the document..  \n09:50\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't know AWM well, not sure  \n09:51\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but possibly  \n09:53\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0hmm ok  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so 11 issues to kill today :)  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(I'll be in a meeting the whole morning, starting in 5 minutes)  \n09:59\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0damn  \n09:59\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0enjoy  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0:)  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cannot say it's enjoyable but it has to be done  \n10:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0bbiab  \n10:26\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:26\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n10:48\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n10:49\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:22\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has quit  \n11:40\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:46\u00a0<Slashman>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:51\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:52\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:45\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:58\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0hi, is there a way to render convert a wiki2.0 string into \u00a0html using velocity code?  \n13:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0spawn57: you have an example in http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Rendering+Module of how to parse a string in a syntax and render it in another  \n13:01\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0at the end  \n13:02\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0thanks  \n13:02\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's also what is done by $doc.getRenderingContent() when you document content is xwiki/2.0 syntax for example  \n13:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0\\*getRenderedContent  \n13:03\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0except that it also execute transformations  \n13:10\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0I tried that but it won't render the object that's attached to the page  \n13:10\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0trying to replicate the share by email feature  \n13:11\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0but when there's an object attached to the page ..getRenderingContent() won't render it. \u00a0\u00a0But it's a page created using AppWithinMinutes so the object is displayed inline when I view the page  \n13:13\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0is the view uses a special template, the \"content\" of the page is empty (you can check that in the wiki editor) - so this is exactly what you get  \n13:13\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0yup, I understand that completely  \n13:14\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n13:15\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0dammit, I tried rendering from xwiki/2.1 to html/4.01, but it's empty  \n13:18\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0is there something wrong with this line? ---> #set ($htmlValue = $services.rendering.render($xdom, \"html/4.01\"))  \n13:19\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0is there anything in the xdom ?  \n13:20\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0I can't tell, but It's not null...  \n13:20\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0..is there a way to see it?  \n13:23\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0you can check with the javadoc: \u00a0http://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/org/xwiki/rendering/xwiki-rendering-api/7.1.2/xwiki-rendering-api-7.1.2-javadoc.jar/!/index.html \u00a0... look into the org.xwiki.rendering.block  \n13:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0the \"Block\" interface ith the API you might me most inters. (the XDOM in a block)  \n13:24\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0and it has eg. \u00a0xdom.getChildren().size()  \n13:27\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0let me try that  \n13:28\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0yeah it's giving numbers  \n13:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0using the traversal methods like \"getBlocks(BlockMatcher\u00a0matcher, Block.Axes\u00a0axes)\" is somewhat impossible in velocity, so there are string based alternatives like \u00a0#foreach($headerBlock in $doc.getDocument().getXDOM().getBlocks('class:HeaderBlock', 'DESCENDANT')) \u00a0\u00a0- get all HeaderBlocks in the current xdom  \n13:28\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0damn, that's complicated for me now  \n13:28\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0hmm  \n13:28\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, then it is odd that the xdom is not empty, but the html is ...  \n13:29\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0unless there's bad syntax..  \n13:29\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it would display a literal \"$services.rendering.render($xdom, \"html/4.01\")\" then, I think  \n13:30\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0dammit  \n13:31\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0maybe add more debugging like \"#foreach($child in \u00a0$xdom.getChildren()) $child.class #end or the like  \n13:32\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0shows things like class org.xwiki.rendering.block.ParagraphBlock  \n13:32\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0anyway, to display the stuff normally shown on the page, usually it is $doc.getRenderedContent() \u00a0... and this displays the objects in the sheet instead of the page content, as it is for \"App within Minutes\" pages  \n13:33\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0one of them was...empty.. but the size is one. \u00a0I thin the content for that is \"red\"  \n13:33\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, ok, yes, to the content contains paragraphs ... admittedly what is to be expected if there is content  \n13:34\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0damn...wonder what's wrong then  \n13:34\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0content is then child of the \u00a0ParagraphBlock ... should contains word blocks and such  \n13:36\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0I wonder why share page by email is able to use $doc.getRenderedContent() and I can't  \n13:36\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0that would save me a whole world of trouble  \n13:36\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yeah, why cann't you? what is the problem when you try to use it?  \n13:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:40\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0oh, I'm trying to use it on with a page that has an object, one that was generated using AppWithinMinutes. \u00a0like yousaid that it earlier,....it's getRenderedContent is suppose to be empty if I try to do that  \n13:40\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0btw, I just tried renderiung a simple xwiki syntax line like \\*\\*red\\*\\* and it doesn't work  \n13:41\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0hm, then \"share by email\" should not work with AWM-pages either, let me check ...  \n13:42\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0...infact it didn't evaluate $services.rendering.render($xdom, \"html/4.01\") too  \n13:43\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0I tried it with AppWithinMinutes, share by email renders the page fine  \n13:43\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0and sends it via email fine  \n13:44\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yeah, I see, and can reproduce: \u00a0#set ($xdom = $services.rendering.parse(\"some \\*\\*bold\\*\\* content\", \"xwiki/2.1\")) \u00a0\u00a0$services.rendering.render($xdom, \"html/4.01\") \u00a0.... shows explicit \u00a0the velocity code  \n13:46\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0what's wrong then?  \n13:46\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0hmm  \n13:46\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0I have to get going now, but can you open an issue, or email me if you find out what to do?  \n13:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0oh, yeah, of course ... it is \"xhtml/1.0\" as output syntax  \n13:46\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0that will work?  \n13:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0not \"html/4.01\" - the corresponding renderer is deprected and seemingly removed  \n13:46\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0works for me then  \n13:47\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0zomg  \n13:47\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0that works for me too  \n13:47\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0let me add it to my script  \n13:47\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0oh really? time to update that wiki page and docs then  \n13:48\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0oh wow  \n13:49\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0yep, you can check with \u00a0\u00a0$services.rendering.getAvailableRendererSyntaxes() \u00a0which syntaxes are available  \n13:50\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0\"html/4.01\" \u00a0is still available as a \\*parser\\*, however, so the example code still works  \n13:51\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0it must be supported, as that is what is produced by the wysiwyg editor  \n13:52\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0I see  \n13:52\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0alright, I got my script working  \n13:52\u00a0<spawn57>\u00a0thanks so much  \n13:52\u00a0<ClemensR>\u00a0glad it works :)  \n13:53\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:25\u00a0<Ramona1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:03\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has quit  \n15:07\u00a0<Denis>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:08\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:27\u00a0<Chuguniy>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:35\u00a0<OSIMasson>\u00a0has quit  \n15:55\u00a0<gsmeria>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n16:00\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tmortagne: did you see this: http://ci.xwiki.org/job/xwiki-platform/org.xwiki.platform$xwiki-platform-extension-handler-xar/1815/testReport/org.xwiki.extension.xar.internal.handler/XarExtensionHandlerTest/testUninstallFromWiki/ ?
