I really find useful the maven xar module for formatting, verifying and building a xar file. One thing I notice is that XWiki exports pages in a very wrong way according to what the XAR plugin consideres valid. For example: Content Author must be [xwiki:XWiki.Admin] but was [XWiki.Admin]  \n11:18\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0should we fix this in export also ? so we get more valid page out of the export ?  \n11:19\u00a0<GuillaumeF1>\u00a0has quit  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: not sure  \n11:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for ex if we put the absolute user name then if the user imports in a local wiki and if he wants to user to the Admin user loccally  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is a topic that needs to be discussed on the devs list I think, you could open a jira or better send an email about it  \n11:21\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I don't have an opinion about it, it just felt more logical, but now that you tell me this, yes, it's a hard topic  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0jvdrean: http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Platform/job/xwiki-platform/ is still failing, please fix it asap we cannot have the build failing for so long  \n11:33\u00a0<GuillaumeF>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:37\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0vmassol: I'll fix it in less than 2 hours  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is bad too: http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Functional%20Tests/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-ui/  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0consistent failing since the 10th  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same here: http://ci.xwiki.org/view/Functional%20Tests/job/xwiki-enterprise-test-extension/  \n12:33\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:38\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has quit  \n12:41\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:53\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:07\u00a0<Guest94316>\u00a0has quit  \n13:07\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:08\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0is now known as <Guest57397>  \n13:26\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:38\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has quit  \n13:57\u00a0<tillo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:01\u00a0<Guest57397>\u00a0has quit  \n14:01\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:02\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n14:03\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:44\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n14:45\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:06\u00a0<xwikibot>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:06\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n15:06\u00a0<cjd\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n15:25\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:45\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: projects in contrib which don't have a jira project associated, don't require a JIRA issue, right ?  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: all contrib project make there own rule but you can create an issue in the contrib jira project and associate proper component  \n15:53\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0or ask to ad a new component if none exist for the project you are targetting  \n15:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0tmortagne: since I don't h ave \u00a0yet a component, I guess I won't need a jira issue  \n15:53\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am about to commit VM creation module (still very early dev)  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0sburjan: again contrib projects do what they want, there is no defined rule you should see with the contrib author  \n15:54\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0I am the author :)  \n15:54\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then it's your call  \n15:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a best practice to have jira and components and versions  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would say it depends is the project has releases or not  \n15:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if you did not do any release yet then a jira issue is not really helpful  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: I'm creating a version + a component for you  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you always need to do a release IMO  \n15:56\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0except for the initial one probably  \n15:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan: what' sthe name of your project?  \n15:56\u00a0<sburjan>\u00a0vmassol: thanks. No, I never did a release, it's only starting to be useful, but I want to commit my code to be safe.
