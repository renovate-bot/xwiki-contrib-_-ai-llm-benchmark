Are you familiar with H2 ?  \n20:19\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0not really but try anyway  \n20:20\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0in normal distro (jetty+hsqldb), the database is stores as an sql script, which is run at every startup  \n20:20\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0\\*stored  \n20:20\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I need to do the same in H2. it seems H2 stores the db in binary  \n20:21\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I'm looking at the H2's manual, but I can't find anything to help  \n20:22\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0I'm really shakey on how the default stuff actually works but what I think happens is it starts the wiki and does an import then it saves the state of the database  \n20:23\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0the state is db specific, it doesn't matter what type of db it is, to us it's just a blob and we pass it to the db and the db reads it  \n20:23\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0yes, but when shutting down xwiki, all the db content is in plain format (readable)  \n20:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0are you trying to mine this file for something?  \n20:24\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0what is the end goal?  \n20:25\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I have an app (not related to xwiki).. and I use h2, but I don't have any sql file in plain. H2 creates the database in binary, not in plain text  \n20:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0my jdbcUrl is jdbc:h2:file:~database.sql an I get a ~datababase.sql.h2.db .. which is binary  \n20:26\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0and you want to turn this into an import script?  \n20:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0something like that, yes  \n20:26\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0basically.. exactly like tht :)  \n20:27\u00a0<@cjdelisle>\u00a0google h2 dump utilities?  \n20:29\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0I was hoping that h2 has something native in this. They have some encryption bullshit on thei manual, but nothing regarding on how the file is stored on disk  \n20:46\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has quit  \n21:11\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n21:23\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n21:41\u00a0<Chami1>\u00a0has left #xwiki  \n21:46\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n21:47\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:29\u00a0<venkatesh>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n23:54\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n\n"}
