This is scary. \u00a0WTF?  \n21:11\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Hi, nothing happens when you click the download link? let me take a look  \n21:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0ahh yes, OW2 is having some issues, let me get you a direct link.  \n21:12\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0did you want 4.4-rc-1 ?  \n21:12\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0yes  \n21:14\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0Here's a link from our own maven hosting: http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-installer-windows/4.4-rc-1/xwiki-enterprise-installer-windows-4.4-rc-1.exe  \n21:18\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0Thanks. I am also new to IRC using mIRC. I am unable to copy and paste the link from it. Any idea how to get it? I cant imagine why this would not work.  \n21:18\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0drsku: double click on the link  \n21:20\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0OK I did not know this was a link \u00a0it looks like text. Surely people need to copy and paste from the IRC client. \u00a0Download has started.. Thanks so much and best wishes for 2013  \n21:21\u00a0<cjd>\u00a0happy new year  \n21:45\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0Total newbie. Trying to install 4.4-rc-1.exe. When the progress bar step is complete I click next and then get a blank screen. It has a next too but this does nothing. Have tried twice. WTF?  \n21:48\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0drsku: Try usng the .zip package, the .exe isn't that well maintained. You should report a bug on jira.xwiki.org, though, so we'll remember to look at it  \n21:49\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0The zip is here: http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/enterprise/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb/4.4-rc-1/xwiki-enterprise-jetty-hsqldb-4.4-rc-1.zip  \n21:51\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0I used a link sent to me by @cjd because I could not get a download to load from the download page. I \u00a0will try your link now  \n21:57\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:01\u00a0<rrodriguez\\_>\u00a0is now known as <rrodriguez>  \n22:06\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n22:27\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0has quit  \n23:56\u00a0<drsku>\u00a0has joined #xwiki\n"}
