I will read it now!  \n18:22\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0I'd say it's easier to use the standalone distribution at the start  \n18:23\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0It's the quickest way, and it's easier to change things and restart  \n18:28\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0oh! Okay! I was actually thinking of using .war version  \n18:28\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0But I will see standalone first then  \n18:34\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0@sdumitriu, can I change the code and run XWiki again in standalone mode?  \n18:34\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Yes  \n18:35\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0oh, ok, thank you!  \n19:32\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:39\u00a0<jvdrean>\u00a0has quit  \n19:40\u00a0<vishnu>\u00a0has quit  \n20:54\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0Hi!

Please, what is the origin of this error message?  \n20:56\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0Thanks!  \n20:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0rrodriguez: sorry I don't have the time but I would recommend searching on google and on the xwiki mailing list archive  \n20:57\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0vmassol: thanks for your answer!
