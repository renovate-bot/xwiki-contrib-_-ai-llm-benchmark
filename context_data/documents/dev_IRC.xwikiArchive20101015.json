 \ntmortagne - (12:07): yes  \ntmortagne - (12:08): are you sure you are up to date ?  \nvmassol1 - (12:08): yes I did a full svn up 30 mn ago  \ntmortagne - (12:08): is cliir executed in your maven log ?

 \nsdumitriu - (12:11): Let me try  \ntmortagne - (12:12): what is weird is that indeed there is no commit since the release  \ntmortagne - (12:12): which mean there should not be any difference between 1.14 and 1.15-SNAPSHOT  \ntmortagne - (12:13): unless there is an issue with the 1.14 on maven repository  \nsdumitriu - (12:13): Build failure  \ntmortagne - (12:13): vmassol1: di you had to download the 1.14 jar when you built tag plugin ?  \nvmassol1 - (12:13): yes  \nvmassol1 - (12:13): I cleaned my lcoal repo  \nvmassol1 - (12:13): so it re-downloaded it  \ntmortagne - (12:13): ok then we are in the same situation  \nsdumitriu - (12:14): I think it's a JDK error  \nsdumitriu - (12:14): TagOperationResult is an enum  \nsdumitriu - (12:14): values() is a standard method of enums  \nsburjan - (12:15): the jar installer has problems. I am able to install it, but when I try to run it, I get an \"Details: failed to change directory \"/.....\"(No such file or directory)\"  \nsdumitriu - (12:15): It can change signature only if the JDK does things differently  \ntmortagne - (12:15): i'm using JDK 1.6.0\\_21  \ntmortagne - (12:15): sdumitriu, vmassol1: what is your's ?  \nsdumitriu - (12:15): 1.5  \nsdumitriu - (12:15): I released with 1.6  \ntmortagne - (12:16): hmm wait actually i'm not using 1.6  \ntmortagne - (12:16): not with maven  \ntmortagne - (12:16): i'm using 1.5.0\\_15  \ntmortagne - (12:16): so it's a 1.5 vs 1.6 thing  \nsdumitriu - (12:17): Yes  \ntmortagne - (12:17): hmm not very good releasing with 1.6  \nsdumitriu - (12:17): Building with 1.6 works  \nvmassol1 - (12:18): I'm on 1.6  \ntmortagne - (12:18): releasing with 1.6 is risky since maven configuration about forced 1.5 is not perfectly applied, for example you can build things like String#isEmpty etc without any complain  \ntmortagne - (12:20): and it make probably built classes depends on some version of class that will fail when executed on 1.5  \ntmortagne - (12:20): s/version of class/version of JRE class/  \nsburjan - (12:21): also the Uninstaller script (uninstaller.java) fails  \ntmortagne - (12:23): releasing with 1.5 should be part of the release process (until we move to 1.6), (note that jvdrean1 and me always release on 1.5 but i forgot to put that in the process)  \nvmassol1 - (12:24): +1  \nsdumitriu - (12:24): Me too, but this time I released from maven.xwiki.org, since my freewifi connection makes transfer times really really long  \nvmassol1 - (12:29): I mean +1 to put it in the release process to remember it  \nasrfel left at 12:38 (Quit: Leaving.  \nasrfel joined #xwiki at 12:38  \ntmortagne - (12:40): sdumitriu: we release on agent-1 generally with jvdrean1  \ntmortagne - (12:40): with is using 1.5  \narkub left at 12:40 (Ping timeout: 272 seconds  \nsilviar left at 12:40 (Quit: Leaving.  \ntmortagne - (12:40): and a lot nicer than releasing on our machine especially for deploy  \ntmortagne - (12:41): releasing on maven.xwiki.org is not very nice of maven.xwiki.org itself and hudson  \ncjdelisle - (12:42): Imagine a project on hudson which when it's started it does an entire release.  \nvmassol1 - (12:43): cjdelisle: yes that's the plan  \nvmassol1 - (12:43): with hudson deploying to a stage nexus repo  \nvmassol1 - (12:43): s/stage/staged/  \nvmassol1 - (12:44): now we need to configure that to make it a reality  \ncjdelisle - (12:44): Imagine we don't have to hold our patches during release week ;)  \nlucaa - (12:45): sdumitriu:do you know how can I keep my firebug active even when I close the panel?  \nsdumitriu - (12:46): Minimize it  \nsdumitriu - (12:46): F12  \nlucaa - (12:46): yes  \nlucaa - (12:47): ah, I see now  \nlucaa - (12:47): there is close and minimize, with the same visual effect but different actions...  \nlucaa - (12:47): almost same visual effect (icon colored or not colored didn't really make much difference to me)  \nlucaa - (12:47): thanks a lot  \nflorinciu left at 13:06 (Quit: Leaving.  \nflorinciu joined #xwiki at 13:15  \nStulle joined #xwiki at 13:27  \nStulle - (13:27): Hey  \nStulle - (13:27): I got another weird error  \nStulle - (13:27): i am trying to export a page with its children  \nStulle - (13:27): however, i get the following error:  \nStulle - (13:28): 2010-10-15 13:22:47,065 [http://localhost/bin/export/Normung/Normen+-+%C3%9Cbersicht?format=pdf&pdfcover=0&pdftoc=0&attachments=1&includelinks=0&includechilds=6] WARN \u00a0web.XWikiAction \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Uncaught exception: Error number 11015 in 11: Exception while exporting  \nStulle - (13:28): com.xpn.xwiki.XWikiException: Error number 11015 in 11: Exception while exporting  \nStulle - (13:28): and so forth  \nStulle - (13:28): any ideas, any suggestions?  \nsdumitriu - (13:36): Stulle: What's the last message in this stacktrace, the root cause?  \nStulle - (13:37): http://pastebin.com/600pMYaD  \nStulle - (13:38): i dunno what you mean in detail so i just pasted the entire log  \nStulle - (13:38): i hope that'll help you  \nsburjan - (13:39): ok. tested also on windows.
