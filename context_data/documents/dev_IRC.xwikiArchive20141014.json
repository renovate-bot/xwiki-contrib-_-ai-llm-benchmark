I wouldn't know how to fix the tests\u2026 and I have still problems understand some things on the CI :)  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the RM is not suposed to fix any test  \n13:53\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0he's supposed to make people fix the tests  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that the release date can be achieved on time  \n13:54\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0that's not what I've seen :) in practice  \n13:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0seriously I don't think there's anything preventing any committer from doing a release  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0techniczally speaking  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*technically  \n13:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0haven't you done one release already BTW evalica?  \n13:55\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0evalica: not sure you really saw all, I can confirm you that it's not the RM who fix everything himself at each release  \n13:56\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0not everything\u2026 but at least he understands what/where the problem is and whom to contact  \n13:56\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0vmassol: I had my full share of releases recently, ty. I`ll pass the next ones if that`s an option.  \n13:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only requirement for the RM is to be strong-willed to hassle the other to fix the tests :)  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma`: well you're the one with the lowest score ATM\u2026 we need to find some metrcis to decide who is the next RM  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and I'm fed up  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0to have to beg every time  \n13:57\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so let me know what you propose?

 \n14:36\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: no idea but don't worry about that, looks like a preformance plugin bug, I reported it to them  \n14:37\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it is not something that must be fixed for the release?  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's actually building find but then at the end it's sending a failing mail without any detailed reason  \n14:37\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0s/find/fine/  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0you even can see the complete stats for that build  \n14:38\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but still it send a failure mail without any reason  \n14:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0Guys, do we consider XWIKI-11171 as a blocker  \n14:55\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0It is not the typical use case  \n14:56\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0It happens when you do edit -> FullScreen -> preview -> back  \n15:04\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:16\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0gdelhumeau: any idea since when it's broken exactly ?  \n15:17\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0no  \n15:17\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I would say the more recent it is the more blocker it is basically  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if it's a regression caused by flamingo it's quite a blocker IMO for example  \n15:18\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0but if this use case is broken since before 4.0 and was reported only now not so much  \n15:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I reproduce on colibri  \n15:21\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0so it should mean that it is old  \n15:49\u00a0<momomomomo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:58\u00a0<msmeria>\u00a0has quit  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cool all jobs for 6.X are passing :)  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0don't commit anything anymore!  \n16:09\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(for that branch)  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0s/6.X/6.2.X  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I'm proposing to start the release now wdyt?  \n16:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0checking the issue list  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0hmm 2 blockers  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0none assigned  \n16:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looking bad  \n16:12\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0and XWIKI-11206 might be considered as a blocker too  \n16:12\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0Enygma`: do you still plan to do XWIKI-6540 for 6.3M1 ?  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: could you look at http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11171 ?  \n16:12\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0mflorea: could you check this one quickly to see if you can fix it or let us know how? http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11152  \n16:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(or reply to guillaume's question in comment)  \n16:14\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0vmassol: I will look into  \n16:15\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok thanks  \n16:16\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: if you cannot fix http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11206 what are you proposing to do?  \n16:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0I don't know  \n16:16\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0tmortagne: push it to 6.3M2  \n16:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0except not supporting IE9, which does not seen acceptable  \n16:16\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0\\*seem  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0then I still propose that we release 6.2.2 without it and that you continue trying to find a fix for 6.2.3, wdyt?  \n16:18\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's better to have all the other fixes released than nothing....  \n16:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0it make sense to have a stable release for people that does not need the ie9 support  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and we put that information in the Release notes  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for 6.2.2  \n16:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0k  \n16:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok so moving to 6.2.3 for now  \n16:19\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0regarding XWIKI-11027, I propose to not fix it in 6.2.x, since it is possibly a breaking change  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n16:20\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0an the other hand, it would make harder to upgrade a custom skin created from flamingo in the 6.2.x version  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: moving it to 6.2.3 thenok ?  \n16:20\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0\\*then ok  \n16:21\u00a0<DarkKnightCZ>\u00a0has quit  \n16:22\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0vmassol: wdyt: should we move it to 6.3.x or 6.2.3? breaking change vs. harder to upgrade to 6.3  \n16:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: I don't know. If the change is not dangerous, 6.2.3 seems better. WDYM by breaking hcange?  \n16:23\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0tmortagne: yes, looks like I removed it on purpose because it wasn't needed anymore  \n16:24\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: ok, removing it then  \n16:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0VMs will be moved from a directory to an other, so if someone has changed the VM, it will be much harder to upgrade  \n16:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0actually it is the same problem  \n16:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0but we just decide in which version we want to have it  \n16:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0from what you say the sooner the better  \n16:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0between 6.2.2 -> 6.2.3 : in a dot release?  \n16:24\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0between 6.2.2 -> 6.3: in a major release?  \n16:25\u00a0<gdelhumeau>\u00a0since we can consider that 6.2.x are not really dot releases, it make sense to fix it the sooner  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0mflorea: looks like there is one missing in DashboardMacro compared to Treeview.xml  \n16:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it's a pity that flamingo was considered usable before this was done, let's learn for the future  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0not sure if it's important  \n16:25\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0it's \"js/smartclient/skins/Enterprise/load\\_skin.js'\"  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0this one is loaded in \u00a0Treeview.xml but not in DashboardMacro  \n16:26\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0do you think we should add it to DashboardMacro ?  \n16:27\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0(also looks like that list id duplicated in way too many places, should probably be put behind some API)  \n16:27\u00a0<andreeapopescu>\u00a0has quit  \n16:28\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0I don't think we need. The reason the Dashboard macro is including the smartclient resources is because the dashboard uses the Macro dialog from the WYSIWYG editor, and the editor has a dep on smartclient which unfortunately must be present on load. But smartclient is used only for the tree and we don't need the tree on the dashboard macro  \n16:28\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok  \n16:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0keeping it like this then  \n16:29\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0I guess moving to your new tree will cleanup all that, right ?  \n16:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0yep  \n16:29\u00a0<mflorea>\u00a0no reason to handle the duplicated lines fro now  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0ok so the only blocker left for 6.3 is XWIKI-11171  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0anyone has any idea ?  \n16:32\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0will test it in older versions  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0same for 6.2.2  \n16:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0;)  \n16:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0gdelhumeau: you didn't reploy to my question earlier about \"gdelhumeau: could you look at http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-11171\u00a0?\"?
