(28/03/2009 19:38): Let me check  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:38): ok :)  \nsdumitriu - (28/03/2009 19:40): Yes  \nsdumitriu - (28/03/2009 19:40): It's too early to tell  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:40): ok, thank you  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:40): now i have some questions abut the project  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:40): you told me that there already is a captcha implementation  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:41): where can i read about it?  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:41): this only if there are useful ideas in it  \nsdumitriu - (28/03/2009 19:42): http://svn.xwiki.org/svnroot/xwiki/platform/core/trunk/xwiki-core/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/plugin/captcha/  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:43): great!, thank you  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:43): let me some .. i think i had other questions too :)  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:44): i was also thinking about the following thing .. and can you kindly give me your feedback?  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:45): for each user .. after few edits .. someone can check his edits ... and we can create for each user some kind of flag .. trustful, medium, spammer .. and for each type to have diferent options  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:46): for example for a medium user .. not very trustful, but not spammer ... we can allow him a certain number of edits per period  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:47): and for spammers .. only one in a long time .. to give him the chance to reabilitate ...   \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:47): because maybe one user will actually want to use his accont in good purposes .. but if we don't allow him any actions .. he will have to create another user ... and will cost some time for both parties  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:48): and we can create a table where, for each user we associate this flag ... and when he logs in .. he gets his personalized options  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:49): what do you think?  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:56): sdumitriu, oh i forgot to mention something .. someone will check only those users that are flagged with medium by the spam detector ...  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 19:57): because not all messages are obvious spams .. and can pass the detector  \nxwikibot - (28/03/2009 19:58): XWiki.MafazHassan was modified by XWiki.MafazHassan (Created user) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/MafazHassan  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:16): sdumitriu: I think it's important for the antispam stuff that all students reuse existing things and not reinvent anything. Reputation based system exists, antispam filters exists (typepad antispam, etc). I haven't followed the discussion but I know people have a tendency to reinvent things in general :)  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:17): vmassol ... where can i find all that already exists?  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:18): ancutagheorghe: on the web, you can use google for example  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:18): no, i mean all the things that already exist al xwiki  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:18): at  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:19): at xwiki the best is http://xwiki.org  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:19): :) thank you  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:19): and then the mailing list archives at http://xwiki.markmail.org  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:19): thank you  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:20): i got the email about typepad .. i will google it to learn more about it  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:20): and then... the source :)  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:20): thank you for that too :)  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:20): you're welcome  \nsdumitriu - (28/03/2009 20:23): vmassol: You're right  \nsdumitriu - (28/03/2009 20:24): But not everything can be reused  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:24): of course, but it should be checked if it can first  \nsdumitriu - (28/03/2009 20:24): ancutagheorghe: Again, I'm not sure that creating a new table is needed  \nsdumitriu - (28/03/2009 20:24): We already have objects  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:25): ok i will keep that in mind :)  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:25): what do you think about the rest of the idea?  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:27): ancutagheorghe: re reputation it's a more generic (and very interesting) domain. It can be used for antispam but it can also be used as a social feature in xwiki. One thing I'd look at is Mediawiki since they have a great need for antispam tools so there are good ideas to take there I'm sure  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:27): doing a mediawiki antispam tool analysis is a must IMO  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:30): vmassol i am sorry i am not familiar with what does reputation mean in this context  \nvmassol - (28/03/2009 20:30): ancutagheorghe: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation  \nancutagheorghe - (28/03/2009 20:31): oh i understand, thanks a lot !  \n\n"}
