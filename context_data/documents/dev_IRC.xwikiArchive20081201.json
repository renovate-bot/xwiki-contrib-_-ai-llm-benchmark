http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/XWikiWebDAV  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:41): asiri1: re the webdav doc, I think that once it's done we should put in the Features list herehttp://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:41): http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:42): if you're ok with this it means you should write the documentation in the same kind of style as it's written for the other features (I think this is what you're doing, user guide style)  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:43): we'll just need to remove the Contribute and Future sections I think  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:43): vmassol: cool!  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:43): I think it would be good to have a list of platforms where it's been tested on  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:44): maybe:  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:44): yes, under \"Accessing XWiki Through WebDAV interface\" section i'm documenting only those environments where xwiki-webdav has been tested on.  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:44): Introduction --> WebDAV  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:45): Accessing XWiki Through WebDAV interface. --> WebDAV Clients  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:45): ?  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:45): btw don't put dots in titles (I've seen you do this on jira issues too ;))  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:45): ah! i'm used to it ;) Will remove them :)  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:46): The topics you mentioned seems to be more generic :-/  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:46): this is really a finished user guide  \nxwikibot - (01/12/2008 16:46): Drafts.XWikiWebDAV was modified by xwiki:XWiki.asiri - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/XWikiWebDAV  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:46): s/is/should be/  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:47): so we shouldn't have things like \"you can leave a comment on this page, send an email to [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or file a jira issue at http://jira.xwiki.org. \"  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:47): (we already have a Support section on xwiki.org)  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:48): BTW a general rule is that you should duplicate information that is elsewhere. For example you should never mention [[email\u00a0protected]](https://dev.xwiki.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) anywhere but instead point to the MailingLists page which defines them  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:49): the idea being that if we modify the lists we won't have to change thousands of pages in the wiki  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:49): s/should/shouldn't/  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:49): if you don't duplicate info it makes it easier to maintain the wiki  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:50): \"As you might agree, being able to view / edit an XWiki repository through a well known abstraction like a file system, is a huge advantage.\": you shouldn't assume but instead list the advantages :)  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:50): (asiri1)  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:50): ah!  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:50): Thanks, a lot need to be improved :)  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:50): (vmassol)  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:51): asiri1: btw how will users disable webdav if they want to? Just by modifying their web.xml?  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:51): (removing the webdav servlet from web.xml?)  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:51): vmassol: Yes. And I'll mention in the doc that ssl is recommended..  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:52): removing the url-mapping will do  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:52): should this info go on the doc ?  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:52): asiri1: no, it should go in the Admin guide  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:53): here: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Configuration  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:53): vmassol: ok  \nxwikibot - (01/12/2008 16:53): Drafts.XWikiWebDAV was modified by xwiki:XWiki.asiri - http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Drafts/XWikiWebDAV  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:53): asiri1: user guide should for people using the webdav feature only  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:54): admin guide is for admins  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:54): and Dev guide is for developers  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:54): s/should/should be/  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:54): so \"Begining from XWiki Enterprise 1.7, WebDAV support has been integrated and enabled by default. There is no special configuration need to be done, simply start your XE installation and you are good to go\" shouldn't be in the user guide ? :)  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:55): (vmassol)  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:55): i think so.  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:55): will update the docs.  \nvmassol\\_ - (01/12/2008 16:55): asiri1: you can mention in an info box that it requires XE 1.7 and above  \nasiri1 - (01/12/2008 16:55): ah, yes.  \nxwikibot - (01/12/2008 18:09): XWiki.lucaa was modified by XWiki.lucaa (Created WatchList storage object) - http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/lucaa  \nxwikibot - (01/12/2008 21:07): Main.Roadmap was modified by xwiki:XWiki.VincentMassol (Updated) - http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Roadmap  \nxwikibot - (01/12/2008 23:14): Main.Test Page One was modified by XWiki.mcampb2811 (deleted document) - http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Test+Page+One  \nxwikibot - (01/12/2008 23:14): Main.Test Page Two was modified by XWiki.mcampb2811 (deleted document) - http://playground.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Test+Page+Two  \n\n"}
