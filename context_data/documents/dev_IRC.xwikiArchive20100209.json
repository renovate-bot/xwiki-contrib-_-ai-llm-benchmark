Now I need to create a page that knows how to parse the formats. I have the java code for that. But how do I integrate it into xwiki?  \nbblfish - (11:11): so presumably I would have to write a plugin  \ntmortagne - (11:13): bblfish: plugins are supposed to be the old way, you should use components now. See http://code.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Modules/ComponentModule  \ntmortagne - (11:14): unless what you want to provide is an authenticator which is neither a plugin or a component (not yet)  \nbblfish - (11:15): now, the authenticators will be for later. First get people to create keys.  \nbblfish - (11:15): thanks for the pointer, ...  \ntmortagne - (11:16): another way is to write your code in groovy or velocity of course  \narkub left at 11:16 (Quit: Leaving  \narkub joined #xwiki at 11:18  \nbblfish - (11:22): I'd rather stick to one language :-) and if I had to I'd rather do scala.  \ntmortagne - (11:23): bblfish: make me think is did not check since a long time if scala provide a JSR223 support  \nKermitTheFragger joined #xwiki at 11:24  \nbblfish - (11:25): I asked on their #irc channel, but they did not seem to know there  \nbblfish - (11:25): #scala  \nbblfish - (11:25): here is the java file btw: http://github.com/harbulot/keygenapp/blob/master/base/src/main/java/uk/ac/manchester/\\_rcs/bruno/keygenapp/base/MiniCaCertGen.java  \nbblfish - (11:32): ah, here is the Servlet http://github.com/harbulot/keygenapp/blob/master/samplewebapp/src/main/java/uk/ac/manchester/\\_rcs/bruno/keygenapp/webapp/MiniCaServlet.java  \ntmortagne - (11:33): found https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-1274 but it's for sling and not for scala  \nbblfish - (11:35): I am not sure the #scala people think of it as a scripting language...
