 \n09:41\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I guess the only option if you really want to prevent slow releases is to drop staging entirely.  \n09:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: you'll have the RC for sure  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: my point in the emails I've sent this morning  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0otehrwise we need to accept to loose 4-5 more days when we do releases  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0or  \n09:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0reduce the RC-final timespan  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's not good  \n09:43\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0users won't have enogh time to install and test it  \n09:43\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a01. long release, 2. no rc, 3. no staging  \n09:43\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0seems to be it  \n09:45\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0at any rate I think if we're going to make any dramatic change we need at least a proposal  \n09:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: sorry I have to start focusing on the windows7 stuff to finish ASAP  \n09:45\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ok  \n09:54\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0cjd: 4.1 RC1 is in staging while others still have code to commit ?  \n09:54\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: yes, there are also a few blockers (I counted 3)  \n09:54\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0What is in staging now will have to be dropped  \n09:55\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0so is there any point for testing it now ?  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sburjan`: yes (if you're prepared to test again later)  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the more tests the better  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if you find some blocking bug now we'll need to fix it  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0while if you wait and find the bugs later we'll need to delay even more  \n09:55\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but you'll spend more time overall  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0tough decision ;)  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0IMO  \n09:56\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0I have to test before I can spot something.  \n09:56\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you could do a quick test now  \n09:56\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0and I'll start testing today  \n09:57\u00a0<+sburjan`>\u00a0bbl  \n09:58\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: just wanted to day that I don't want to be a pain in the \\*\\*\\*.

 \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie finding blockers, stabilizing  \n11:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0nope, before the push  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only difference is that we were not publihsing anything during the stabilization  \n11:22\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so all is good ATM  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we just need to fix blockers ASAP  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so that we can release RC on Monday or Tuesday  \n11:23\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I just need a set of dates when I should push to staging, and push to maven.xwiki so I can plan around them, if the dates need to be moved then that's ok, but right now I have no idea if you're suggesting I do this in an hour or a week?  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you've already pushed to staging  \n11:23\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't undertand  \n11:23\u00a0<jvelo\\_>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:23\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I gather you want that staging repository dropped and it re-staged.  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0theoretically you need to repush every time there's a change in 4.1 branch  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what is called staging!!!  \n11:24\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Which makes sense since there are some new issues.  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0stagng means:  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok guys can you test  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok issue found , we fix it and restage  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this is what we're doing now  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I've fixed one  \n11:24\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which was the blocker bug on windows7 install  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have 2-3 more  \n11:25\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can either repush now or wait for some more fixes  \n11:25\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has quit  \n11:25\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you need to monitor the 4.1 branch too for commits.

What it can have is a calm period after which we decide it's ok to release  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0move what date?  \n11:26\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you said 12th right?  \n11:27\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0It was the 11th but you wanted thursday to fix the windows issue so I figured the prudent thing to do is shift everything up 1 day  \n11:27\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0then the testers are not trying to test in 2 hours of something silly  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0for me it jsut dpeends how fast we can fix the 2-3 blockers  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if they're fixed today we could release Monday  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if they're fixed Monday we could release Tuesday  \n11:27\u00a0<jvelo\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n11:27\u00a0<jvelo>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0according to what staging means testers should already be testing  \n11:27\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0however no announve have been made  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so I doubt anyone is testing  \n11:28\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ok so we will have no testing after the last known bug is fixed  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(except sorin)  \n11:28\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0except of course post-rc release  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we coudl view staging  \n11:28\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0as replacing the period of stabilizinf we were doing before  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in this case it doesn't delay the release  \n11:29\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie. for ex 2-3 days before the planned release date  \n11:30\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0how about the final, should we have a guaranteed 2 days of time from the last known good version to final?  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and it means to developers that they need to quickly wrap up their stuff and possibly only important bug fixes during this perdio  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(we'll always have exceptions though)  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0re final I guess it depends if we make any change or not after RC1  \n11:30\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we could stage 2-3 days before the date  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0not sure it's required but we could do it  \n11:31\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0this means mid next week  \n11:31\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0supposing more issues are found and fixed, do we want to potentially do the last stage of the final version without giving testers 2 days to look at it?  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0normally RC means we consider it's goof to eb released  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so if we fix bugs they're blockers only  \n11:32\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0and there shouldn't be a lot  \n11:33\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0So should it be a rule that final is delayed to make time for the testers to look at it?  \n11:33\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0(if it needs to be)  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you want to delay it?  \n11:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have close to 1 week  \n11:34\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0we had a week 1 week ago and now we're out of time, it seems that it's somewhat acceptable to release blind since it's \"just\" an RC  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we're 8th today  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the final is 18th  \n11:34\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0assuming we release RC1 on Monday or Tuesday  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we have 1 week - 1 day  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that's what I call close to 1 week  \n11:35\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:35\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0the question is if issues arrise do we remove the 2 day test period or do we delay final/  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if issue arise on the 17th sure we might want to delay  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if issue arise on 13th I don't see the point in delaying  \n11:35\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0in any case there's no point in defining a rule ehre  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it depends completely on the issue at hand  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0what we need to do is release for the 18th till something changes that  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ie try our best for the 18th  \n11:36\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0ok so then the rule is this: \u00a0RCs do not need to have testing time, staging is optional.. Final must have testing time and if that time is not available due to issues which cause the release to need to be remade, final must be delayed.  \n11:36\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0correct?  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0I don't understand  \n11:36\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sorry  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you've staged RC already  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0so now peopmle should be testing  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0why do you call that no testig time?  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0the only problem is that you've not annoucned it  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0actually you did  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but not very widely  \n11:37\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I'll have to build and stage rc-1 again.  \n11:37\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0sure that's staging  \n11:38\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0That will not be well tested before becoming the official rc-1  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it doesn't mean the full XWiki has changed  \n11:38\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0If something happens and I have to build and stage final again, do we do the same thing?  \n11:38\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which btw is why I said that staging cannot have an end date if we want to do it strictly  \n11:39\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0IE is there a \"clean period\" where testers are dealing with the exact binary which will be in production.  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0that cannot exist  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0because it assumes testers will never find any bug  \n11:39\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0which obviously is not correct  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0you can only know that after the fact  \n11:40\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0the assumption being that if testers find a bug which is bad enough to be worth blocking ther release, we delay and rebuild, giving testers another \"clean period\" to hopefully not find another blocker.  \n11:40\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0when you test you can never know if what you're testing is going to be in production  \n11:40\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Which sounds like a disaster when I word it that way  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0now all of this fun to discuss  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but in practice I doubt anything will change  \n11:41\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0no problem, I just wanted a clear picture of what you want.  \n11:41\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0do you know anyone testinf xwiki ATM (except sorin)?  \n11:42\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I give it a quick run and I imagine developers test their features  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0yep we do that  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0but we don't want the staging for that  \n11:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0want / wait  \n11:42\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0true enough  \n11:43\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I just wanted something definitive which I can write down and document on the list and in the release plans  \n11:43\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I will write it up and you can let me know if it sounds wrong.  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0ok  \n11:45\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0it would be good to have others opinions too  \n11:57\u00a0<Denis1>\u00a0has quit  \n12:07\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0is this a blocker? http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7885  \n12:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0looks like one tome  \n12:08\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0the issue is that there is no place to add an event if you are editing the page?  \n12:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0cjd: just discussed with Enygma`  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0we had the issue before apparently but it was less visible  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0(it could even have been considered a feature before, it looks weird now)  \n12:11\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0Enygma` is trying to fix it  \n12:12\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0Something we can count on being resolved for monday?  \n12:13\u00a0<@cjd>\u00a0I guess I'm tired or something because when I look at the page I can't tell the difference between the 3.0 version and the 4.1M1 version heh  \n12:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0if Enygma` cannot solve it today we could consider to skip it, wdyt Enygma`?
