Is that enabled by default?  \n01:24\u00a0<amon>\u00a0My goal as you probably guessed is for an Enterprise type setup for a small distributed company. Only staff may be allowed access; staff are in groups such that someone working on a proposal doesn't necessarily have access to Finance documents, etc.  \n01:25\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n02:10\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has quit  \n02:58\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n03:16\u00a0<amon>\u00a0How do I modify user passwords? I used ones that were too long the first time through and now I've got 12 user accounts that are no good and I cannot seem to get at a user panel to make the changes.  \n03:20\u00a0<amon>\u00a0The ability for the administrator to change a password is a fairly common need anyway, ie in case of a security breach, that I need to know how in general so I might as well learn now.  \n03:21\u00a0<amon>\u00a0One way I found was to delete the user and recreate them, but that might have side effects I don't want in a live environment.  \n03:22\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Might also note that an 18 character limit on pass phrases is a bit short these days. I often use double that or even more.  \n03:54\u00a0<amon>\u00a0When I select a user and the select preferences where the password should be, it just kicks me back to the menu panel but with a title: Administration: admin.${crtItemId} which looks to me like a bug.  \n03:59\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Yep, side effects of deleting and recreating a user to change the password are messy. I was not surprised to find it removes them from all groups, etc.  \n04:12\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Interesting... I seem to have got to the password change through a different pathway...  \n04:30\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Okay. If I am logged in as Admin and I click on the User name and the Preferences, I can change the password; if I instead clickon the \"manage' icon, the pencil, and then click on preferences, I get kicked out. Looks like a bug to me.  \n05:27\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0amon: There should be no limit on the password length  \n05:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Since it's a hash, you could put megabytes of length and it would still fit  \n05:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0And it should be possible to change the password of another user  \n05:28\u00a0<@sdumitriu>\u00a0Worst case, directly from the object editor on the user's profile  \n08:26\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has quit  \n09:06\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:07\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n09:10\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n09:13\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:01\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n11:10\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n11:19\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:07\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:34\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n12:38\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n12:42\u00a0<evalica>\u00a0has quit  \n13:27\u00a0<Enygma`>\u00a0has quit  \n13:42\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n13:47\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n13:48\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n14:04\u00a0<DrLou>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:06\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has quit  \n14:33\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:42\u00a0<sdumitriu>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n14:42\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n15:02\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n15:09\u00a0<lucaa>\u00a0has quit  \n15:24\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:11\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n19:20\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:21\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n19:26\u00a0<npm\\_>\u00a0has quit  \n19:27\u00a0<npm>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:07\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n20:08\u00a0<vmassol>\u00a0has quit  \n20:21\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n20:23\u00a0<rrodriguez>\u00a0has quit  \n22:05\u00a0<sburjan`>\u00a0has joined #xwiki  \n22:14\u00a0<abusenius>\u00a0has quit  \n23:18\u00a0<amon>\u00a0Sergou: I can create a password of any length in the admin interface, but a user complained they could only type in 18 characters in their browser.  \n23:19\u00a0<amon>\u00a0I have no idea if they were getting something wrong or not, perhaps they could type more without being limited.  \n\n"}
