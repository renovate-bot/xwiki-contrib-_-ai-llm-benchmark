 \n11:42\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0it's the same in each case  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0maybe tomcat is run by root and it's useless to look at it :)  \n11:43\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0hah, tomcat is installed via a script so I can't tell exactly, it's not a manual install sorry  \n11:43\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0if tomcat is running you can see who runs it in top or ps  \n11:44\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0but everything was launched with root (it's a secure environment, without any access to Internet)  \n11:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0yeah as far as I can tell, everything except mysql is stuck to user root  \n11:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0(and I don't even see a catalina process, only \"java\" process)  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0then I can't tell you  \n11:45\u00a0<xwiki\\_finstern>\u00a0(never understood that)  \n11:45\u00a0<tmortagne>\u00a0what error do you get exactly in the log ?
