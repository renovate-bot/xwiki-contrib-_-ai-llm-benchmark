  "prompt": "How do I configure group synchronization between XWiki and my OpenID Connect provider?\nI'm using an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims, and I want to synchronize these groups with XWiki groups. What's the process for setting this up?",
  "expected_answer": "To configure group synchronization between XWiki and your OpenID Connect provider 1. Locate the `xwiki.properties` file in your XWiki installation directory.\n2. Open the file with a text editor.\n3. Configure the group synchronization by setting the `oidc.groups.claim` property to the name of the claim used by your OpenID Connect provider to send group information. For example:\n```java\n#-# The name of the claim used to get the list of groups the user belong to.\n# oidc.groups.claim=groups\n```\nReplace `groups` with the actual claim name provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. If your OpenID Connect provider sends group memberships as a single value attribute delimited by a specific character (e.g., a comma), configure the `oidc.groups.separator` property with the appropriate character:\n```java\n#-# If the identity provider returns group memberships as a single value attribute delimited with a char, for example:\n# oidc.groups.separator=,\n```\nReplace the comma with the actual separator used by your provider.\n1. If you want to map the synchronized groups to specific XWiki groups, configure the `oidc.groups.mapping` property with the appropriate mappings:\n```java\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup\"=group1\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup2\"=group2\n```\nReplace `MyXWikiGroup` and `MyXWikiGroup2` with the names of the XWiki groups you want to map, and `group1` and `group2` with the actual group names provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. Save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.",
