This typically involves changing permissions in the codebase, updating access control lists (ACLs), or modifying role-based access controls.\n\nIf this is done within software with administrative features like CMS platforms (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal), you would typically navigate to your dashboard or user interface where administrators manage site settings and permissions. From there, look for sections related to user roles, permissions, or security settings. Adjust the script right permissions specifically tied to Administrator roles within those settings.\n\nPlease note that altering access rights can be sensitive operations, so they must only be carried out by authorized personnel.",

Anyone with edit rights can write a script in a wiki page. However, when the page is rendered, the script will only execute if the last author of the page has the &quot;Script&quot; right.\n\nXWiki &lt;14.10 For backward-compatibility reasons, the standard XWiki distribution comes with the &quot;Script&quot; right being allowed for all users at the main wiki level. So, unless an administrator explicitly revokes the right for some users or groups, they will be able to execute the scripts they wrote.\n\nXWiki 14.10+ The script right gives a lot of power to users so by default the right is not given anymore to all users at the main wiki level: administrators have to manually allow it.\n\n* Availability: Page and Wiki level.\n* Default status:\n\t+ ALLOWED on the main wiki\n\t+ DENIED on sub-wikis\n* Priority order: deny &gt; allow &gt; no setting\n* Checking order: page &gt; wiki\n\n",

      "content": "Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to use the new checkAccess() method everywhere you check an access before action. And you should refrain to catch the resulting exception, this should be done at higher level, by the UI which will therefore be able to centralize all access check violations. (Obviously this is a work in progress that we are starting now and will only properly work when the full migration of the old service is completed). Also note that, access violation done during checkAccess() are logged. In most situation, this should not happen, since the UI, or earlier code have already checked the possibility for access, and does not provide a path to the prohibited action. Remember also, that checking the same access several time is no more cost full, so checking access very near the action (even if you think there is no reason it would be denied) is good security measure to prevent security bugs. This is clearly the purpose of the checkAccess() method.\n\n## Some definitions as seen by this module\n\n",
