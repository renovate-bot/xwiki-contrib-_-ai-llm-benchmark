  "prompt": "Can I authenticate users with access tokens?",
  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can authenticate users with access tokens using the Token-based authentication for the LLM Application extension.\n\nThis extension allows external applications to authenticate users with signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The token needs to contain specific claims, such as expiration time, issuer, subject, and audience, and must be signed with an Ed25519 key.\n\nTo use this authenticator, you need to:\n\n1. Enable the token authenticator by setting the `xwiki.authentication.authclass` property in `xwiki.properties` file to `org.xwiki.contrib.llm.authentication.JWTTokenAuth`.\n2. Configure the authorized applications by adding a new entry to the \"Authorized Applications\" list, specifying the application's title, URL, public key, and group format.\n3. Generate a JWT token that meets the required claims and signing key requirements.\n4. Include the token in the \"Authorization\" header of the request in the form \"Bearer TOKEN\".\n\nNote that this authenticator only supports creating or updating users based on the information provided in the token and does not support using a token as authentication for an existing user that hasn't been created through this authenticator.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LLM%20Application/Authenticator/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LLM%20Application/Index%20for%20the%20LLM%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Authentication/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/Authenticator/ \n\n\nYes, you can authenticate users with access tokens in XWiki. According to the information provided, XWiki supports JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Here's a brief overview of how to set it up:\n\n### Token Generation\n\n1. **Generate Keys:**\n   You need to generate a private and public key pair using the Ed25519 algorithm. This can be done using OpenSSL with the following commands:\n   ```sh\n   openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -outform PEM -out private.pem\n   openssl pkey -in private.pem -pubout -outform PEM -out public.pem\n   ```\n\n2. **Create JWT Token:**\n   The JWT token must contain specific claims:\n   - `exp`: Expiration time (must be in the future but not more than 24 hours in the future).\n   - `iss`: Issuer (corresponding to the URL property configured in the authorized applications).\n   - `sub`: Subject (used for deriving the username).\n   - `aud`: Audience (must contain the URL of the XWiki installation in the form `https://www.example.com/` without path).\n\n   Optional claims include:\n   - `given_name`: First name of the user.\n   - `family_name`: Last name of the user.\n   - `email`: Email of the user.\n   - `groups`: List of groups the user belongs to.\n   - `iat`: Issued at (time when the token was issued).\n   - `nbf`: Not before (token is rejected if this time is in the future).\n\n3. **Include Token in Authorization Header:**\n   The token must be included in the `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer TOKEN`, where `TOKEN` is the signed JWT token.\n\n### Example JWT Token\n\nHere's an example of what a JWT token might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"exp\": 1633072800,\n  \"iss\": \"https://example.com\",\n  \"sub\": \"user123\",\n  \"aud\": \"https://www.example.com/\",\n  \"given_name\": \"John\",\n  \"family_name\": \"Doe\",\n  \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\",\n  \"groups\": [\"developers\", \"admin\"],\n  \"iat\": 1633069200,\n  \"nbf\": 1633069200\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nEnsure that your XWiki instance is configured to accept JWT tokens. This typically involves setting up the appropriate authenticator and configuring the authorized applications in the XWiki administration interface.\n\nBy following these steps, you can authenticate users with access tokens in XWiki.",

If your XWiki instance has very different domains for its wikis, this fix will not work.\n\nWhen using Tomcat as a servlet container, it&#x27;s possible to change the domain of the cookie JSESSIONID by adding the attribute sessionCookieDomain to context.xml as such :\n\n&lt;Context sessionCookieDomain=&quot;mytld.org&quot;&gt;  \n...  \n&lt;/Context&gt;# Endpoints\n\n## Callback\n\npath: **authenticator/callback**\n\n## [Back-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html)\n\npath: **authenticator/backchannel\\_logout**\n\n# Bypass OpenID Connect\n\nAs indicated in the previous section you can disable OpenID Connect using the property oidc.skipped in the xwiki.properties file.\n\nIt&#x27;s also possible to skip OpenId Connect temporarily using a URL parameter: for example https://mydomain/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?oidc.skipped=true.\n\n",
