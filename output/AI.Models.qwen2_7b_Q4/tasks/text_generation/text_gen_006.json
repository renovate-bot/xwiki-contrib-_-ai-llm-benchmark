  "ai_answer": "In fields of green and skies to see,\nWhere mountains stand with soaring glee,\nThe beauty of nature, so wide,\nA work of art that never dies.\n\nThe rustling leaves in playful breeze,\nA symphony not meant to please,\nBut for those who listen closely,\nAnd feel the earth's life fully.\n\nThe gentle river flows so free,\nCarving paths through rocks and tree,\nIts current strong yet ever calm,\nTeaching us balance, and making room.\n\nIn skies of blue with fluffy clouds,\nLies a beauty that astounds,\nWith sunsets painting golden hues,\nBringing peace to troubled souls anew.\n\nAnd in the night, stars twinkle bright,\nA sky full of secrets just right,\nGuiding lost ones on their way,\nTheir light shining as they play.\n\nNature's beauty surrounds us all,\nIn every breath and every call,\nIt teaches us patience, humility,\nAnd reminds us why we're here to be.\n\nSo let us cherish this gift so dear,\nFor in its splendor, we find our cure,\nA connection deep within our hearts,\nTo the world outside that we must always guard.",
