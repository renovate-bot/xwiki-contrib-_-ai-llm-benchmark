A very important detail is that the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page. Also, having administration rights imply the view, comment, edit and delete permissions with the added ability to permanently delete a page from the recycle bin.\n\n* Availability:\n\t+ page (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete rights)\n\t+ Wiki (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete, register)\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki > page\n\n## Programming Right\n\nA programmer is allowed to execute arbitrary Java code in the wiki, so any page which was last saved by an user with programmer rights can run dangerous scripts.

  "ai_answer": "To create a wiki page script that only executes if the last author has the \"Script\" right:\n\n1. Open the XWiki administration interface.\n2. Navigate to the \"Main\" or desired wiki's settings, depending on your version of XWiki (XWiki <14.10 vs XWiki 14.10+).\n3. Locate the \"Security Module\" section in the wiki settings.\n4. Find the \"Script\" permission and modify its status for either the main wiki level or sub-wikis based on the availability information provided.\n\nFor version compatibility:\n\n- **XWiki <14.10**: The standard distribution allows users to have the \"Script\" right at the main wiki level by default.\n- **XWiki 14.10+**: By default, the \"Script\" right is not granted to all users at the main wiki level; administrators must manually grant it.\n\nTo ensure that a script executes only when executed by someone with the \"Script\" permission:\n\n```markdown\n# Script Execution Check\n\n## Page Script Execution Check\n\nThis script will execute if and only if the last author of this page has the \"Script\" right.\n\n**Check Function:**\n\n1. Retrieve the user who authored the latest version of this page.\n2. Verify if they have the \"Script\" permission in either their personal settings or within the wiki's permissions.\n\n### Implementation Example\n\n```xwiki\n# Check if Script Permission Exists for Last Author\n\nif (hasPermission(\"Script\", getUserOfLastVersion())) {\n    // Your script code here, which will only execute if the last author has the 'Script' right.\n}\n```\n\n**Function Explanation:**\n\n1. `getUserOfLastVersion()`: This function retrieves the user who made the latest update to this page.\n2. `hasPermission(\"Script\", <user>)`: Use this XWiki API method to check if a given user has a specific permission, in this case, \"Script\".\n\nBy implementing this logic, your script will only execute when run by someone with the necessary \"Script\" right, ensuring security and preventing unauthorized execution.\n```\n\nThis wiki page script checks whether the last author of the current page possesses the \"Script\" right before executing any custom code. This ensures that scripts are executed only by users who have been explicitly granted permission to do so.\n\nPlease replace `<user>` with the actual user ID or use the appropriate method for your XWiki version and environment to handle this check effectively.",
