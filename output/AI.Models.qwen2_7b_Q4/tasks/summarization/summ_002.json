  "ai_answer": "Title: XWiki Script Right Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Overview:\n\nThe \"Script\" right in XWiki is designed to control who can execute scripts on a page. This feature ensures security by limiting script execution only to the last author of the page who has this specific right.\n\n#### Key Points:\n1. **Default Status**: For backward-compatibility reasons, the standard distribution of XWiki grants the \"Script\" right to all users at the main wiki level.\n2. **Execution Mechanism**: Scripts are executed during rendering when their author possesses the \"Script\" right.\n3. **Right Inheritance**: The Script right is managed on a per-page basis and does not inherit through sub-wikis.\n\n### Table: XWiki Script Right Configuration\n\n|**Right**| **Description**| **Default Status**| **Priority Order**| **Checking Order**|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|**Script**| Allows the execution of arbitrary Java code on a page.| **Allow (Main Wiki) / Deny (Sub-Wiki)**| **deny > allow > no setting**| **page > wiki**|\n- **Main Wiki**: The \"Script\" right is enabled by default for all users.\n- **Sub-Wikis**: Users without explicit permission cannot execute scripts unless the administrator grants this right.\n\n### Implementation:\n1. **Enabling Script Execution**: Administrators can enable or disable the execution of scripts on a page-by-page basis, depending on their security policies.\n2. **Admin Rights Overwrite**: The \"Script\" right takes precedence over other settings; if enabled for the main wiki, it applies globally unless overridden at the sub-wiki level.\n\n### Integration with Other Rights:\n- **Automation and Security**: Combine with other rights to build a comprehensive security model that restricts access based on roles and permissions.\n- **Compatibility Considerations**: Ensure compatibility between different versions of XWiki where the default status for \"Script\" right might vary.\n\n### Best Practices:\n1. **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and update user permissions based on their current roles and responsibilities to maintain security standards.\n2. **Educational Resources**: Utilize resources like the XWiki Security Module documentation for in-depth guidance on managing rights effectively across the wiki environment.\n\nBy following these guidelines, administrators can ensure a secure and efficient implementation of the \"Script\" right in their XWiki instances, balancing functionality with risk management.",
