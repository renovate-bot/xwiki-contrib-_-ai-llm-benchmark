The default wiki (extensions might provide more) provides the following RSS feeds:\n\n* Feed for all modified pages. This is available from the [Notifications Application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/).\n* Feed for all Blog posts. This is available if your wiki has the [Blog application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Blog%20Application) installed.\n* Feeds for Search results. This is available if your wiki has the [Search application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Search%20Application) installed.\n* Feeds on Tags. This is available if your wiki has the [Tag application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Tag%20Application) installed.\n* The [Watchlist Feature](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Watchlist%20Application) allows you to get a RSS feed of all the modifications to the pages in your Watchlist.\n\nNote that you can choose to start receiving information from the Blog and modified pages feeds by using your browser's RSS notification button. For example on Firefox:\n\n![rss.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RSS/rss.png?rev=1.1)\n\n# Customized RSS Feeds\n\nEven more so, it's easy to create new RSS feeds to fit a specific need (or modify existing RSS feeds):\n\n* You can also easily create your own page that outputs RSS (Atom, RDF, etc). Edit the Main.WebRss page in your wiki to see how it's implemented and do the same in your own page.\n* You can also modify the existing RSS pages (e.g. Main.WebRss) if you wish to customize the default RSS content produced by the various applications.\n\n\n",

  "ai_answer": "The text describes how RSS feeds can be used on an XWiki instance for notifications about activity taking place within the platform. It outlines several default RSS feeds available:\n\n1. **Feed for all modified pages**: This feed is accessible through the Notifications Application and notifies users of changes made to any page.\n\n2. **Feed for all Blog posts**: Provided if the Blog application is installed, this feed alerts users about new blog entries.\n\n3. **Search results feeds**: Available when the Search application is enabled, these feeds notify users of search results matching specific queries.\n\n4. **Feeds on Tags**: Offered when the Tag application is installed, these feeds alert users to changes in pages tagged with certain keywords or categories.\n\n5. **Watchlist Feature**: Allows users to receive notifications about modifications to pages they are watching.\n\nUsers can also customize RSS feeds by creating their own pages that output RSS content (e.g., Atom, RDF) and modifying existing RSS pages like `Main.WebRss` to tailor the default RSS feed content according to specific needs.",
