  "ai_answer": "This text describes how in XWiki, every change made to a page is automatically saved in its version history. This allows users to compare different versions of the same page to see what changes have been made and revert any unwanted modifications by rolling back to an earlier version. The process involves finding the \"History\" tab or menu item on the bottom or top of a page, respectively, selecting multiple versions to compare, viewing differences in content, attachments, and comments between those versions, using the browser's back button to return to previous steps, accessing specific versions through their number in the \"Version\" column, and rolling back to an earlier version via a dedicated button. For more information on this feature, users are directed to the Version Control page on XWiki.org. The text concludes by suggesting the next step for customization is changing the logo and panels in the platform.",
