The modified page now replaces the previous version. This makes it easy to update the website and have people contribute content. Each version of the page is stored in the page history and can be reverted to if needed.\n\nOn top of this basic feature set, most wikis include additional features such as access rights management and notifications.\n\nThe core advantages of a wiki compared with traditional Content Management Systems and ECM lie in its flexibility and the ease with which new pages can be added and linked to.\n\nThanks to their flexibility and ease of use, wikis can be used to address a wide range of situations:\n\n* Share information about a given topic (knowledge base, product catalog, documentation)\n* Manage a project (organize an event, create a product, setup a new tool)\n* Communicate with other people (as a website, an intranet or an extranet)\n* And much more!\n\nBasically, a wiki can be used whenever you want to use a flexible platform to centralize information and share it with other people. It comes as a handy replacement to email when many-to-many communication takes place and information needs to be made available to every participant in one place.

  "ai_answer": "A wiki is a website that allows easy online editing by multiple users. Users can modify pages, make changes, and save them directly, replacing the previous version of the page. Each edit maintains a history for revert purposes. Wikis offer additional features like access management and notifications beyond basic functionality.\n\nThe key benefits of wikis over traditional Content Management Systems (CMS) or Enterprise Content Management (ECM) platforms include flexibility and ease in adding new pages that can be linked together. They are versatile tools suitable for various applications such as knowledge sharing, project management, communication, and more.\n\nWikis are particularly advantageous when many users need to communicate about a topic and share information centrally instead of using email. XWiki is one type of wiki platform with additional features tailored for enterprise use cases.\n\nFor more details on how wikis can be utilized in different scenarios, you can visit the references page provided.
