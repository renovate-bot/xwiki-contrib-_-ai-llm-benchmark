  "prompt": "Please summarize the following text:\n\n\n[A wiki is a website that you can edit online easily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki).\u00a0\n\nWhenever you want to modify a page, click on the \"edit\" button, make your changes and save the page. The modified page now replaces the previous version. This makes it easy to update the website and have people contribute content. Each version of the page is stored in the page history and can be reverted to if needed.\n\nOn top of this basic feature set, most wikis include additional features such as access rights management and notifications.\n\nThe core advantages of a wiki compared with traditional Content Management Systems and ECM lie in its flexibility and the ease with which new pages can be added and linked to.\n\nThanks to their flexibility and ease of use, wikis can be used to address a wide range of situations:\n\n* Share information about a given topic (knowledge base, product catalog, documentation)\n* Manage a project (organize an event, create a product, setup a new tool)\n* Communicate with other people (as a website, an intranet or an extranet)\n* And much more!\n\nBasically, a wiki can be used whenever you want to use a flexible platform to centralize information and share it with other people. It comes as a handy replacement to email when many-to-many communication takes place and information needs to be made available to every participant in one place.

  "ai_answer": "The text is an introduction to the concept of a wiki, describing it as a website that allows easy online editing. It explains how users can edit pages by clicking on \"edit,\" making changes, and saving them, which replaces the previous version with each update. The modified page history is stored for revertability if needed. Wikis also offer additional features like access rights management and notifications.\n\nThe core advantages of a wiki compared to traditional Content Management Systems or ECM are flexibility and ease in adding and linking new pages. These platforms can be used for various purposes, such as sharing information about a topic (e.g., knowledge base, product catalog, documentation), managing projects, communicating with others, among other applications.\n\nA key selling point highlighted is that wikis serve as a flexible platform to centralize information and facilitate communication when many-to-many interactions occur. They can replace email for collaborative work where information needs to be available to all participants in one place.\n\nThe text concludes by suggesting interested readers explore specific usage examples through the XWiki website's references pages, leading into further details about what makes XWiki special with its enterprise edition features.",
