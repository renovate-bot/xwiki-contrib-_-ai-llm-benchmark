A very important detail is that the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page. Also, having administration rights imply the view, comment, edit and delete permissions with the added ability to permanently delete a page from the recycle bin.\n\n* Availability:\n\t+ page (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete rights)\n\t+ Wiki (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete, register)\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki > page\n\n## Programming Right\n\nA programmer is allowed to execute arbitrary Java code in the wiki, so any page which was last saved by an user with programmer rights can run dangerous scripts. Because it affects the entire wiki (or wiki farm), programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page in a single wiki environment or from the main wiki in a multi-wiki environment.\n\n* Availability: Main wiki level (automatically implies \u00a0LOGIN, VIEW, EDIT, DELETE, REGISTER, COMMENT, SCRIPT, ADMIN, see the documentation for the [security module](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module))\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki\n\n## Register Right\n\nThe register right is usually granted or revoked for the non-registered pseudo-user \"XWiki.XWikiGuest\".

So, unless an administrator explicitly revokes the right for some users or groups, they will be able to execute the scripts they wrote.\n\nXWiki 14.10+ The script right gives a lot of power to users so by default the right is not given anymore to all users at the main wiki level: administrators have to manually allow it.\n\n* Availability: Page and Wiki level.\n* Default status:\n\t+ ALLOWED on the main wiki\n\t+ DENIED on sub-wikis\n* Priority order: deny > allow > no setting\n* Checking order: page > wiki\n\n# Tabular view\n\n\n\n| Right | Description | Default 1) | Priority 2) | Order | Remarks |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **View** | The view right gives the user the ability to view a document or load it using the API. | Allow | deny >allow >no setting | page > wiki |  |\n| **Comment** | The comment gives the user the ability to add a comment, but not to edit or delete it. | Allow | deny >allow >no setting | page > wiki | In order to be able to edit or delete your own comments, you need to have edit rights on the \u00a0page.

  "ai_answer": " The XWiki security system is based on the concept of rights, which are specific permissions that users or groups can have on pages or wikis. There are several predefined rights in XWiki, including:\n\n* View: Allows a user to view a page or load it using the API.\n* Comment: Allows a user to add comments but not edit or delete them. To edit or delete your own comments, you need to have edit rights on the page.\n* Edit: Allows a user to edit a page and all of its objects.\n* Delete: Allows a user to move a page to the recycle bin.\n* Administration: A very powerful right that can only be granted at the page or wiki level. It includes the view, comment, edit, and delete permissions with the added ability to permanently delete a page from the recycle bin.\n* Programming: Allows a user to execute arbitrary Java code in the wiki. This right should be used with caution as it can affect the entire wiki (or wiki farm).\n* Register: Allows a user to register an account on the wiki.\n* Create Wikis: Allows a user to create new wikis.\n* Script: Allows a user to write scripts in a wiki page that will be executed when the page is rendered.\n\nThese rights can be granted or revoked at different levels, including the main wiki level and the sub-wiki level. The default status for each right varies depending on the level. For example, by default, all users have view rights on the main wiki but not on sub-wikis.\n\nThe order of priority for these rights is as follows: deny > allow > no setting. This means that if a user has an explicit deny for a certain right, they will be denied that permission regardless of any implicit or explicit allows. If there is no explicit allow or deny, the default status applies.\n\nIn addition to these predefined rights, XWiki also supports custom rights and groups. Custom rights can be defined by administrators to meet specific needs, while groups allow for easier management of permissions for multiple users.",
