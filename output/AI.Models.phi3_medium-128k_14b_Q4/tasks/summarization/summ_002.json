Also, you won't be able to edit or delete the comments of other users, unless you have administration rights.\n\n# Edit Right\n\nThe edit allows you to edit the page and all of its objects.\n\n* Availability: Page and Wiki level.\n* Default status: ALLOWED\n* Priority order: deny > allow > no setting\n* Checking order: page > wiki\n\n# Delete Right\n\nThe delete right allows you to move a page to the recycle bin.\n\n* Availability: Page and Wiki level.\n* Default status: DENIED (unless you're the document creator)\n* Priority order: deny > allow > no setting\n* Checking order: page > wiki\n\n# Special Permissions\n\n## Administration Right\n\nThe administration right can only be granted at page or wiki level. A very important detail is that the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page. Also, having administration rights imply the view, comment, edit and delete permissions with the added ability to permanently delete a page from the recycle bin.\n\n* Availability:\n\t+ page (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete rights)\n\t+ Wiki (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete, register)\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki > page\n\n## Programming Right\n\nA programmer is allowed to execute arbitrary Java code in the wiki, so any page which was last saved by an user with programmer rights can run dangerous scripts. Because it affects the entire wiki (or wiki farm), programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page in a single wiki environment or from the main wiki in a multi-wiki environment.\n\n* Availability: Main wiki level (automatically implies \u00a0LOGIN, VIEW, EDIT, DELETE, REGISTER, COMMENT, SCRIPT, ADMIN, see the documentation for the [security module](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module))\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki\n\n## Register Right\n\nThe register right is usually granted or revoked for the non-registered pseudo-user \"XWiki.XWikiGuest\". This permission can only be set from the wiki preferences page.\n\n* Availability: Wiki level\n* Default status: ALLOWED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki\n\n## Create Wikis Right\n\nThe \"createwiki\" right can only be granted via the main wiki, just like programming rights. .\n\n* Availability: Main wiki level\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki\n\n## Script Right\n\nThe \"Script\" right was introduced in version 7.2 in order to control who has the right to write scripts. Anyone with edit rights can write a script in a wiki page. However, when the page is rendered, the script will only execute if the last author of the page has the \"Script\" right.\n\nXWiki <14.10 For backward-compatibility reasons, the standard XWiki distribution comes with the \"Script\" right being allowed for all users at the main wiki level. So, unless an administrator explicitly revokes the right for some users or groups, they will be able to execute the scripts they wrote.\n\nXWiki 14.10+ The script right gives a lot of power to users so by default the right is not given anymore to all users at the main wiki level: administrators have to manually allow it.\n\n* Availability: Page and Wiki level.\n* Default status:\n\t+ ALLOWED on the main wiki\n\t+ DENIED on sub-wikis\n* Priority order: deny > allow > no setting\n* Checking order: page > wiki\n\n# Tabular view\n\n\n\n| Right | Description | Default 1) | Priority 2) | Order | Remarks |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **View** | The view right gives the user the ability to view a document or load it using the API. | Allow | deny >allow >no setting | page > wiki |  |\n| **Comment** | The comment gives the user the ability to add a comment, but not to edit or delete it. | Allow | deny >allow >no setting | page > wiki | In order to be able to edit or delete your own comments, you need to have edit rights on the \u00a0page.

This applies only to the main level of Wikipedia where this right is also set as default.|\n| **Edit** | The edit allows modification on the page and its components. | Allow | deny > allow> no setting | page > wiki | Defaulted on the main level, users can alter pages but must have editing rights to make changes or delete comments (unless they're admin). This applies primarily at Wikipedia where this is default permission.|\n| **Delete** | The delete right permits moving a page into the recycle bin. | Deny  | deny > allow> no setting | page > wiki | Defaulted on main level as well, users cannot remove pages unless they have administrative privileges (also applicable primarily at Wikipedia). |\n| **Administration** | This grants admin rights and includes viewing, editing, deleting capabilities along with the ability to permanently delete a page from recycle bin.  | Deny  | allow > deny> no setting | wiki >page | Automatically including other permissions like login, view, edit, register; this is only granted at the main level (primarily Wikipedia), administrators can't revoke their admin rights on certain pages.|\n| **Programming** | Enables users to execute Java code in wiki pages which may carry potential risk depending upon the last person who modified the page.  | Deny (Main Wiki) Allow (Sub Wiki) | deny > allow> no setting | wiki | This is controlled at either main or sub-wiki levels, with more risk at main level and Wikipedia; scripts only run if latest editor has script rights, which could cause danger as per the nature of code executed.|\n| **Register** | Permission for non-registered users to perform actions on a wiki page (represented as XWiki.XWikiGuest). Can be set from wiki preferences.  | Allow | allow > deny> no setting | wiki | This applies to the main level where it can only be adjusted via the wiki's preference panel and doesn\u2019t have any implications on sub-wiki levels in Wikipedia.|\n| **Create Wikis** | The \"create wikis\" permission permits creation of new wikis at the main wiki, with more risk involved (primarily for Wikipedia).  | Deny | allow > deny> no setting | wiki | This right can only be granted through main level settings primarily targeting Wikipedia and doesn\u2019t apply to sub-wiki levels.|\n| **Script** | Allows script writing but requires latest editor permission, providing control over execution of scripts that may cause potential harm if misused (mainly affecting Wikipedia).  | Allow for Main Wiki >Deny for Sub Wiki  | deny > allow> no setting | wiki | Standard distribution comes with the \"Script\" right being allowed for all users on main level by default unless revised. This is specifically relevant to Wikipedia and does not apply in other contexts. |\n| **Additional Information**: | Additional rights, implied permissions, and more information about these settings can be found at [this security module page](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module) as noted above in the first table for further reading.|\n",
