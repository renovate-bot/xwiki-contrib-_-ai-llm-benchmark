You don't need to upgrade to intermediary versions.\n\nNote 2 It's also good to check the [Release Notes](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/) for the versions between your old version and the new version you're upgrading to. You should pay an extra care about the section in the release notes entitled \"Issues specific to XWiki <version>\". For example, it's important to check if the new version of XWiki you're upgrading to has new [hardware of software requirements](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/#HHardwareandSoftwarerequirements).\n\nBackup Before you proceed, be sure to [backup](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Backup) all of your data, just in case something goes wrong with the update / downgrade. Depending on your usage, you should be backing up your information regularly.\n\nExtensions Before upgrading XWiki itself it's generally a good idea to make sure that all your extensions are up to date since new versions might contain compatibility fixes that would have otherwise preventing the new version fully start.\n\n# Upgrading\n\nKeep your XWiki instance up to date to benefit from the best new features and keep your data safe from security threats. There are multiple methods to upgrade XWiki depending on how many data you need to migrate or how experienced you are with different tools.\n\nIn the majority of cases an upgrade consists of two parts:\n\n* Part 1: Upgrading the *distribution* on the *server / filesystem* and\n* Part 2: Upgrading the *flavor (wiki pages)* from a *browser*.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Part 1 Upgrading the distribution\n\n### Method 1.A Upgrading from the Debian package .DEB\n\n* Update packages index:sudo apt update\n* Package upgrade:sudo apt upgradeThis will upgrade all packages, not just XWiki. If you want to avoid all the other packages and only update XWiki, you can use sudo apt install xwiki-tomcat9-mariadb (change xwiki-tomcat9-mariadb for the top level package you installed if you installed something else).\n\nWhen upgrading from pre 9.5 version apt upgrade won't find anything because the package name changed ([XWiki Enterprise does not exist anymore](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWiki%20Enterprise%20is%20dead%2C%20long%20live%20XWiki%21)).\n\nAll you have to do in this case is install the xwiki-tomcat\\* package corresponding to the top level xwiki-enterprise-tomcat\\* one you installed previously. For example if you had xwiki-enterprise-tomcat8-mysql 9.4 you should do sudo apt install xwiki-tomcat8-mysql.\n* Pages upgrade:However after upgrading you still need to install the new UI; see next step [Upgrading the flavor](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Upgrade/UpgradeDebian/#HPart2Upgradingtheflavor) below.\n\n### Method 1.B Upgrading from Docker .Docker\n\n* If you've installed XWiki by using the official XWiki Docker image, [follow the instructions there](https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/docker-xwiki/blob/master/README.md#upgrading-xwiki) for upgrading it.\n\n### Method 1.C Upgrading the WAR .WAR\n\n* The general strategy is to [download the new WAR distribution](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Download) and to replace your current installed WAR with it. However make sure you don't copy on top since this could leave some old files around which would make XWiki fail (like if old JARs are lying around in WEB-INF/lib). In addition you would override some XWiki configuration files located in WEB-INF (xwiki.properties and xwiki.cfg to name just two).\n* Thus, before replacing your current WAR, make sure you [back it up, including configuration and data files](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Backup).\n* Also you need to ensure that you use the same XWiki Permanent directory (configured in WEB-INF/xwiki.properties using the environment.permanentDirectory property).\n* Some additional operations may be required for upgrading and you must check the [release notes](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/) for all the versions from the version you're upgrading from up to the new version you're installing. It's also possible that new features are available and that some configuration files need to be modified. If this is the case then it'll be specified in the release notes.\n* Note that the database schema is automatically upgraded when needed. All you need to do is to ensure your xwiki.cfg file is correctly configured to perform the migration. Here's a relevant excerpt from the xwiki.cfg file:\n\n#-# Whether migrations are enabled or not. Should be enabled when upgrading, but for a better startup time it is better to  \n#-# disable them in production.  \nxwiki.store.migration=1  \n  \n#-# Whether to exit after migration. Useful when a server should handle migrations for a large database, without going  \n#-# live afterwards.  \n# xwiki.store.migration.exitAfterEnd=0  \n  \n#-# Indicate the list of databases to migrate.  \n#-# to upgrade all wikis database set xwiki.store.migration.databases=all  \n#-# to upgrade just some wikis databases set xwiki.store.migration.databases=xwiki,wiki1,wiki2  \n#-# Note: the main wiki is always migrated whatever the configuration.  \n# xwiki.store.migration.databases=From a failed migration the database tables **DATABASECHANGELOG** and **DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK** may be left over.  \nEnsure that these tables are dropped before restarting a failed migration.\n* **Invalid Extensions**\n\nAlso note that when you upgrade, some extensions that were previously valid may become invalid \u00a0(for example they may have been renamed, removed or have versions that do not match the version of the WAR you've installed as is the case with the example below). In this case you'll see in the console messages such as:\n\n2013-12-02 11:43:01,688 [localhost-startStop-1] WARN \u00a0ltInstalledExtensionRepository - Invalid extension [org.xwiki.enterprise:xwiki-enterprise-ui-common-5.2.1] on namespace [wiki:xwiki]  \n2013-12-02 11:43:01,688 [localhost-startStop-1] WARN \u00a0ltInstalledExtensionRepository - Invalid extension [org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-workspace-ui-5.2.1] on namespace [wiki:xwiki]  \n2013-12-02 11:43:01,688 [localhost-startStop-1] WARN \u00a0ltInstalledExtensionRepository - Invalid extension [org.xwiki.enterprise:xwiki-enterprise-ui-mainwiki-5.2.1] on namespace [wiki:xwiki]  \n2013-12-02 11:43:01,689 [localhost-startStop-1] WARN \u00a0ltInstalledExtensionRepository - Invalid extension [org.xwiki.enterprise:xwiki-enterprise-ui-wiki-all-5.2.1] on namespace [wiki:workspacetemplate]These are just warnings and don't affect that stability of your instance. Actually the Distribution Wizard you get (see the next section on \"Upgrading wiki documents\") will ask you to upgrade those invalid extensions and will remove the old versions that became invalid.\n\n### Method 1.D Upgrading the demo package .ZIP\n\n* If you've installed the standard distribution (zip or jar distribution) and you wish to upgrade it, the simplest is to [download](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Download) the new version and install it as you did the first time. Just make sure you don't install the new version over the old one (both installations need to exist).\n* Then copy [the configuration files and the permanent directory](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Backup) from the old installation to the new one. Ideally you should not copy over the configuration files exactly since the new version could have added new configuration options and thus ideally you should do a merge instead of a pure copy. Another strategy is to use the new configuration files, not copy over the old configuration files and instead manually edit the new configuration to make the same changes as you have may done before (If you've never touched the configuration files then there's nothing to do obviously!).\n* If you're on a unix system here are some commands that may help you doing the merge instead of doing it fully manually:\n\n## Note: We're assuming that \"xwiki.new\" is a symbolic link that points to the location   \n## where the new xwiki version is located and that \"xwiki\" is the location of the previous   \n## xwiki installation.  \nmv xwiki.new/WEB-INF/web.xml xwiki.new/WEB-INF/web.xml.ori; sudo sdiff xwiki/WEB-INF/web.xml xwiki.new/WEB-INF/web.xml.ori -B -W -E -o xwiki.new/WEB-INF/web.xml  \nmv xwiki.new/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg xwiki.new/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg.ori; sudo sdiff xwiki/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg xwiki.new/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg.ori -B -W -E -o xwiki.new/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg  \nmv xwiki.new/WEB-INF/xwiki.properties xwiki.new/WEB-INF/xwiki.properties.ori; sudo sdiff xwiki/WEB-INF/xwiki.properties xwiki.new/WEB-INF/xwiki.properties.ori -B -W -E -o xwiki.new/WEB-INF/xwiki.properties  \nmv xwiki.new/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml xwiki.new/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml.ori; sudo sdiff xwiki/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml xwiki.new/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml.ori -B -W -E -o xwiki.new/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml  \nmv xwiki.new/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml xwiki.new/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml.ori; sudo sdiff xwiki/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml xwiki.new/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml.ori -B -W -E -o xwiki.new/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml\n* Note that the database schema is automatically upgraded when needed. All you need to do is to ensure your xwiki.cfg file is correctly configured to perform the migration. Here's a relevant excerpt from the xwiki.cfg file:\n\n#-# Whether migrations are enabled or not. Should be enabled when upgrading, but for a better startup time it is better to  \n#-# disable them in production.  \nxwiki.store.migration=1  \n  \n#-# Whether to exit after migration. Useful when a server should handle migrations for a large database, without going  \n#-# live afterwards.  \n# xwiki.store.migration.exitAfterEnd=0  \n  \n#-# Indicate the list of databases to migrate.  \n#-# to upgrade all wikis database set xwiki.store.migration.databases=all  \n#-# to upgrade just some wikis databases set xwiki.store.migration.databases=xwiki,wiki1,wiki2  \n#-# Note: the main wiki is always migrated whatever the configuration.  \n# xwiki.store.migration.databases=From a failed migration the database tables **DATABASECHANGELOG** and **DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK** may be left over.  \nEnsure that these tables are dropped before restarting a failed migration.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Part 2 Upgrading the flavor\n\n### Using Distribution Wizard\n\nRecommended The recommended way to upgrade an XWiki installation is to use the [Distribution Wizard](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/DistributionWizard) which is automatically triggered after you upgrade the XWiki WAR (you need to be logged with a user having admin rights). It allows you to automatically upgrade extensions installed in your wiki, supporting automatic merges and conflict resolution.\n\nIf you're upgrading an XWiki far (i.e. a wiki with multiple sub-wikis), you'll need to navigate to each subwiki. You'll then be presented with the Distribution Wizard for each wiki that requires an upgrade.\n\nMake sure you run the Distribution Wizard (DW) with a user having Programming Rights. The following pages require being saved by a user having Programming Rights to work correctly and they may happen to have been modified and thus the DW may need to modify them:\n\n* AppWithinMinutes.DynamicMessageTool (kept for backward-compatibility, not used)\n* AnnotationCode.Style\n* AppWithinMinutes.LiveTableEditSheet\n* AppWithinMinutes.ClassEditSheet\n* AnnotationCode.Script\n* XWiki.OfficeImporterAdmin\n* Filter.WebHome\n* WikiManager.Translations\n\nIf you have already done the upgrade with a user not having Programming Rights, then log in with a user having those permissions (or ask someone who has them), [navigate to those pages](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/How%20can%20I%20navigate%20to%20a%20given%20page), edit them (using the wiki editor preferably) and save them without any modification.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Start fresh, plus Export and Reimport your data\n\nThere are cases when all you can do is [export your current content as a XAR](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/ImportExport) and [reimport it](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/ImportExport) into [a new instance](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/). You should use this method when you know exactly what content you have created and you manually check to not forget anything on the old instance.\n\nIt's usually not recommended because it means bypassing completely the automatic migration of data which is often not a good idea because it might make some data unreachable because they need to be changed for some reason (the filesystem attachment are stored in a different path, some data changed from String to List, etc.).\n\nIf your use case is that you want to move XWiki to a different server and upgrade it you should do it in two step:\n\n* move XWiki to the new verison in the exact same version and make sure all is working as expected\n* upgrade XWiki as explained in previous sections\nSome tips:\n\n* Make sure to only import your own content pages and not the default XWiki pages since you\u2019d overwrite the ones provided in new XWiki install.\n* You may get issues when trying to export a large XAR. In that case you may want to try installing [one of the Export Extensions](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Tags?do=viewTag&tag=export) but you'll need to verify that the one you install will work on your old version of XWiki.\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Downgrading\n\nYou should try to upgrade to a version that fixes the issue you're facing instead of downgrading. However if you really need to downgrade, read on...\n\nA previous upgrade may have modified the database schema and the data saved in the permanent directory may also have incompatible changes. Thus the best strategy for downgrading is using the [Alternative Method](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Upgrade/#HAlternativeStartfresh2CplusExportandReimportyourdata), and that consists of [exporting your wiki pages as XAR](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Backup#HUsingtheXWikiExportfeature) (the ones having your content, not the default wiki pages provided by the XWiki distribution or installed Extensions). Then install the older XWiki version and re-install optional Extensions that you need. Then reimport your XAR in it.\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## XWiki won't start without any error in the log and stay stuck on Solr initialization\n\nSolr has a tendency to lock itself when it has several cores to initialize. To workaround that, XWiki started creating new cores with an option to disable loading the core during Solr init (it's loaded during its first use), but you might still have some existing cores without this option set, in which case you will have to set it by hand: go to <permdir>/store/solr/ and edit each core core.properties file to add loadOnStartup=false\n\n\n",

  "ai_answer": "Upgrading your XWiki installation may be necessary due to bug fixes, performance improvements, or new features that become available with newer versions. It's crucial to understand the steps involved in upgrading and maintaining your data integrity throughout the process. Below is an improved guide on how you should proceed with a successful upgrade:\n\n# Guide to Upgrading XWiki 15x to Newer Version\n\nXWiki 15x has been a robust platform for years, but as time goes by and new technology emerges, upgrading may become necessary. However, this process comes with potential risks if not done correctly. Below are detailed steps to help you upgrade your XWiki installation while ensuring minimal risk:\n\n## Preparation Steps (Prerequisites)\n\n- Backup your XWiki content by [exporting all pages as XAR](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/ImportExport). \n- Take note of the current version number and download the required new release from the official website or repository. Ensure you are following instructions that correspond to your current operating system's package management (e.g., Yum, Apt) for installation.\n- Verify sufficient disk space before starting the upgrade process, as the upgrade might need more space than expected during transitional stages.\n\n## Upgrade Process:\n\n1. Stop running services/daemons of XWiki and Solr if they are active using their respective control panels or command line interface. This is necessary to avoid potential data loss during the upgrade process.\n2. Uninstall existing versions of XWiki, followed by deleting its content directory located at `/var/xwiki`. Cleanup any temporary files created during previous upgrades, specifically in `/tmp` and `solr_tmp` directories if available.\n3. Download new release packages for XWiki and Solr from their official sources.\n4. Install the downloaded packages using your package manager (Yum, Apt), following provided installation guidelines to ensure a smooth transition without leaving unnecessary or deprecated files behind.\n5. Restart XWiki services/daemons once new versions have been successfully installed and configured.\n\n## Post-upgrade Steps:\n\nAfter performing the upgrade steps above, your next steps are vital in maintaining the integrity of your upgraded system:\n\n1. Verify all wiki pages have correctly migrated by comparing content from backup with current XWiki instance. You can compare files directly or use available diff tools for this purpose. Make sure to manually check each page and verify that nothing is missing, such as attachments (both local and remote filesystem) and images displayed within the wiki environment.\n2. Test core features of XWiki thoroughly by accessing various pages through a web browser and using different browsers if possible to ensure compatibility and responsive design aspects work as intended. Check for any unexpected behavior or issues that may need additional adjustment.\n\n## Alternative Method (starting fresh):\n\nIf you encounter significant challenges during the upgrade, it might be better to start anew in a new environment:\n\n1. Backup your current data and wiki content as mentioned before. Export all pages to XAR format and create a list of installed extensions and plugins from both XWiki Admin Console > Manage Extensions page and /var/xwiki_extensions directory contents. Also, remember the server configuration used (e.g., Apache 2 with mod_ssl or Nginx).\n2. Set up your new environment by installing XWiki on a fresh instance in accordance with instructions provided for specific versions. Use this opportunity to review and follow best practices for securing your server's communication channels (HTTPS, SSH, etc.), using SSL certificates from trusted providers like Letsencrypt or Verisign.\n3. Reimport the backed-up XAR in your new environment by [applying the import process](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/ImportExport). Update necessary configuration files for Solr to ensure proper setup and load balance options (e.g., `loadBalancerHosts` parameter in solrconfig.xml) as per your deployment needs.\n4. Set up XWiki extensions and plugins using the provided list of previously installed ones, ensuring their compatibility with new versions and proper functionality within a clean environment.\n5. Configure user management (create default accounts or adjust roles/permissions if required), SSL certificate configuration, load balancing options for Solr instances (e.g., enabling load balancing with `solrsync` utility). Make sure you have also configured any firewall rules and other security settings according to your requirements and best practices guidelcued before deploying on new environments or making significant changes in server setup.\n6. Perform thorough testing of XWiki features by accessing various pages, checking for broken images/attachments (both local and remote filesystem) with correct Solr configurations (including proper configuration files and necessary parameters adjustment). Validate all core features' responsiveness across multiple browsers if possible, ensuring that no unexpected behavior is occurring in the upgraded environment.\n\nBy following this guide carefully, you can ensure a successful upgrade to newer versions of XWiki with minimal risks involved. However, it is essential to evaluate each step and assess your readiness before initiating the process\u2014safety measures like backing up data should be followed as prerequisites regardless of the chosen upgrade path (original environment or starting fresh).\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nAs with any upgrade scenario in technology deployments, risks exist. These include potential data loss and application downtime during transitional phases, so proceed with caution and understanding. When upgrading from version 15 to a later major version (e.g., version 20x or 36x), expect higher levels of complexity in both preparation and execution stages, requiring extra attention for successful upgrades.\n\nRemember that following best practices regarding system security, server configurations, and thorough testing are essential for maintaining an updated and secure XWiki environment post-upgrade.",
