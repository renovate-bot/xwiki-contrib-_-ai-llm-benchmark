  "prompt": "Please summarize the following text:\n\n\nXWiki is a [second-generation wiki](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/SecondGenerationWiki). What we mean by this is that XWiki is a wiki, but it also is an application development platform in its own right. An application is a set of pages that adds new functionality to the wiki - such as a [blog](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Blog%20Application) or a [task manager](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Task%20Manager%20Application).\n\nXWiki offers both the features expected from a professional wiki (such as powerful access rights and user management) and the possibility to create new applications on top of the platform. This means that you can extend the wiki's feature set with new ones pretty easily. For instance, you could create a FAQ or an application to manage product sheets.\n\n\n![example.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/WhatsSpecialAboutXWiki/WebHome/example.png?height=330&rev=1.1)  \n\n*4 examples of how XWiki is being used - clockwise from top left:   \n as a community hub, as a presentation website, as a public   \n wiki and discussion platform, as an education solution.*\nThis allows XWiki to be used for a variety of use cases, such as:\n\n* Intranets\n* Public web sites\n* Knowledge management\n* [CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) needs\n* Project collaboration\n* Portal with mashed-up data from external sources\n* Competitive intelligence,\n* Public debate,\n* Collaborative creation of school courses\n* and [more](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/References/)...\n\nXWiki comes with a number of applications already built-in, detailed on the [Features page](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/).\n\nA list of applications and macros for XWiki is available [on the extensions wiki](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/).\n\n**Next: [XWiki basic concepts](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/XWikiBasicConcepts)**\n\n\n",

  "ai_answer": "XWiki is a second-generation wiki platform that provides all the standard features expected from professional wikis like access control and user management. However, what sets XWiki apart is its capability to allow developers to create additional applications on top of it. These applications can range from blogs and task managers to other custom functionalities like FAQ creations or product sheet management. \n\nXWiki's versatility is showcased by the four primary use cases highlighted: serving as an internal community hub, presenting information on a public website, acting as both a knowledge base and discussion platform, and providing education solutions. Additionally, XWiki caters to various other scenarios including Intranets, CMS needs, project collaborations, integration of external data into portals, competitive intelligence gatherings, hosting public debates, collaboration on school curricula, among others.\n\nIn addition to its core wiki functionalities, the software comes with several built-in applications as detailed in the \"Features\" page on their documentation site. For those looking for more extensive capabilities or specific use cases, there is a list of applications and macros available through extensions on the XWiki extensions platform.\n\nTo further understand how to effectively utilize XWiki's features and functionality, users are directed to explore basic concepts through its user guide chapter on \"XWiki Basic Concepts\".",
