  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Hey kids, you know how we eat food for energy? Well, guess what? Plants need energy too! But instead of using yummy snacks or meals, they use something called \"photosynthesis\" - it's like a super special power that allows plants to catch sunshine from the sky and turn it into energy so they can grow strong and healthy. Isn't that cool? Just imagine if we could eat sunlight instead of sandwiches!",
