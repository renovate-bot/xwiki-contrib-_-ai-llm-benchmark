  "ai_answer": "Hey kids! Did you know that something amazing happens in plants? It's called photosynthesis, and it\u2019s like a superpower they have to make their own food using sunshine from the sky! Plants love soaking up the sunlight with their leaves. They use this sun energy as an invisible recipe to create their yummy food which helps them grow big and strong. Just think of plants having their very own solar-powered kitchen in each leaf, where they mix water from the ground and carbon dioxide from the air to make sugar, helping them do all sorts of fun things like growing flowers or tasty vegg groves!",
