  "prompt": "Adapt the following text to a younger audience (age 8-10):\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the plant's activities.",
  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Hey kids, have you ever wondered how a plant gets its food? It's really cool! Plants make their own \"yummy\" using something called photosynthesis - like making cookies with sunlight as an ingredient! They use the energy from the Sun to turn water and air into tiny pieces of sugar that they can eat. This helps them grow, bloom pretty flowers or even produce yummy fruits for us to munch on. So remember, plants are just like little chefs using sunshine as their oven!",
