  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/NestedPagesMigration/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/ \n\n\nIn XWiki, you can achieve this by using the Access Control mechanism along with the Team feature. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Create Teams:**\n   - Go to the Dashboard > Administration > Users and Groups.\n   - Click on 'Groups' and then click 'New Group'.\n   - Create a group for each team, e.g., \"TeamA\", \"TeamB\", etc.\n\n2. **Create Spaces:**\n   - Each team should have their own space. You can create spaces manually from the Dashboard > Create Space or programmatically using the XWiki REST API.\n   - Make sure to set the parent space (e.g., \"Main\") for each team's space, so they're all organized under a common hierarchy.\n\n3. **Configure Access Rights:**\n   - Go to the Space Tools > Permissions of your Main space.\n   - Click 'Edit' and then click '+ Add Right'.\n   - Set the right as follows:\n     - Type: Read\n     - Groups: Check all teams (e.g., TeamA, TeamB)\n   - This allows all teams to view all spaces.\n\n4. **Configure Edit Rights:**\n   - Now, go to each team's space (e.g., TeamASpace) and configure the edit rights.\n   - In the Space Tools > Permissions of the respective team's space:\n     - Click 'Edit' and then click '+ Add Right'.\n     - Set the right as follows:\n       - Type: Read/Write\n       - Groups: Check only their own team (e.g., for TeamASpace, check TeamA)\n   - This restricts editing to only the respective team.\n\n5. **Apply Changes:**\n   - Click 'Save' to apply these changes.\n   - Now, all teams can view all spaces but can only edit their own space.",

It means that all user-created page are called WebHome.\u00a0\n\nThen, when the user wants to create a sub-page, for example FrankCapra\u00a0inside the page Directors.WebHome, he actually creates a new space inside the space Directors with its WebHome page: Directors.FrankCapra.WebHome. That&#x27;s how we emulate it.\n\nThe notion of space has been removed from the UI. It&#x27;s not mentioned anywhere, anymore. Everything seems to work as if we were really creating sub-pages, even if under the hood, we create sub-spaces.\n\nThat emulation should be temporary. At some point we&#x27;d like to refactor the core model of XWiki and discard the concept of spaces to only keep pages. Don&#x27;t hold your breath though, this may be several years in the coming ![emoticon_wink](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_wink.png?cache-version=1711538036000)\n\nNote that users still have the ability to create pages that are not named WebHome. As a consequence, such pages (that are not the &quot;WebHome&quot; of their space) cannot have sub-pages. They&#x27;re called **Terminal Pages**.\n\n",

      "content": "### Parent/Child relationship\n\nThe user was able to specify a **parent** page for each page he had created. This parent could have been any page, for example the page Movies.ItsAWonderfulLife could have Directors.FrankCapra as parent. Then ItsAWonderfulLife was listed as Child of FrankCapra. This relationship was displayed in the *breadcrumb* at the top of each page. The user was able to navigate through this *hierarchy*.\u00a0\n\nSome applications used this parent/child relationship to organize their data. For them, this relationship is crucial.\n\n### The introduction of the Nested Pages concept\n\nIn XWiki 7.2, due to frequent users demands, we have introduced the ability to create spaces under other spaces. It&#x27;s the **Nested Spaces** concept. We suddenly had the ability to create a hierarchy of spaces to organize content.\n\nBut we have also found some issues. What if a space has the same name as a page? Which entry should we render to the user when he reaches an URL where two entities match? Moreover, does it make sense to have a difference between a space and a page? Why couldn&#x27;t pages have sub-pages inside of them?\n\nWe then have decided to switch to the **Nested Pages** concept. In theory, a page should now be able to have some sub-pages, because we don&#x27;t need to have a distinction between a page and a space like we have between a file and a folder.\n\nBut this change was not possible to make at the API level because it would have required too much work that we could not afford at this time (and breaking backward-compatibility incidentally since it would have required a complete model change). So the decision was made to stick to the **Nested Spaces** implementation at the API level (for now), but to propose **Nested Pages** at the UI level.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n",

The link will point to a page inside that \u00a0wiki. If no wiki is specified, the current wiki is used. Example: mywiki\n\t\t- **pageNameList**: A required list of slash-separated wiki Pages names pointing to the final linked wiki Page syntax.

Denying EDIT at the wiki level will not allow a user/group to create pages anywhere unless Allowed at the Page &amp; Children level. Denying EDIT on on Page/Space will deny editing the main page, but allow pages to be created in the space.\n\n# Wiki Access Configuration\n\nThe first thing you may want to do is configure a **policy access** for your wiki. Depending on what you intend to use your wiki for, you have several options: you can configure your wiki to be public, so that people can edit and comment without necessary being registered or logged in or you can limit the access only to registered users, by configuring a private wiki.\n\n",
