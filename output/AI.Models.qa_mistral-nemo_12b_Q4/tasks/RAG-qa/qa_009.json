  "prompt": "How can I deny script right to a space administrator?",
  "expected_answer": "This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI \n\n\nTo deny script rights to a SharePoint site collection administrator, you can follow these steps. (Note that this is done on an individual basis and not all administrators will be affected.)\n\n1. **Create a new Permission Level:**\n   - Go to your Site Settings page.\n   - Under the \"Users and Permissions\" section, click \"Advanced permissions\".\n   - In the ribbon, click on \"EditPermissionsDirectly\".\n   - Click on \"Create user policy\".\n   - Name this policy something like \"Read Only\".\n   - Check only the permissions you want to grant (e.g., View Pages, Open Items in Lists).\n   - Click \"Create\".\n\n2. **Change Administrator's Permission Level:**\n   - In the same Advanced Permissions page where you created the new permission level.\n   - Find the administrator whose script rights you want to deny.\n   - Click on their name and then click \"Edit User Permissions\".\n   - Under the \"Permission Levels\" section, select the custom permission level you created earlier (e.g., Read Only).\n   - Click \"OK\".\n\nThis will limit the administrator's permissions to the ones defined in the new permission level. However, it's important to note that this won't completely deny script rights if they have been granted through other means like SharePoint Designer or via PowerShell.\n\nFor complete control over script access, you might want to consider using SharePoint's item-level permissions or even better, implement a proper security model like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) which allows you more granular control over user permissions.",

      "content": "Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to use the new checkAccess() method everywhere you check an access before action. And you should refrain to catch the resulting exception, this should be done at higher level, by the UI which will therefore be able to centralize all access check violations. (Obviously this is a work in progress that we are starting now and will only properly work when the full migration of the old service is completed). Also note that, access violation done during checkAccess() are logged. In most situation, this should not happen, since the UI, or earlier code have already checked the possibility for access, and does not provide a path to the prohibited action. Remember also, that checking the same access several time is no more cost full, so checking access very near the action (even if you think there is no reason it would be denied) is good security measure to prevent security bugs. This is clearly the purpose of the checkAccess() method.\n\n## Some definitions as seen by this module\n\n",

While hasAccess() method will simply provide true/false answer, the checkAccess() method does not need any return value check, since it will throw an AccessDeniedException if the resulting access has been denied.\n\nIn the old right service, there were no distinction between access check for UI purposes, and access check for really proceeding to action. Only the hasAccess() method was provided. Missing this distinction is not good because:\n\n* it does not allow easily finding all critical security access check points where access is checked for ensuring security.\n* it leave the responsibility of properly checking return values by the caller at these security check point.\n* it leave the burden of managing access denied situation individually in all those security check points by the caller.\n\n",
