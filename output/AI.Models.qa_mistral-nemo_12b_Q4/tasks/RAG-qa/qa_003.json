  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I am not receiving notifications about my own activity. How can I enable notifications for my own actions?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, one don't receive notification about one's own activity (unless the event that triggered the notification targets explicitly that user). You have the ability to disable this filter in the \"Advanced filtering options\" section of your own notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \n\n\nIn XWiki, you might not be receiving notifications for your own actions because they are likely filtered out to avoid cluttering your notification center with self-generated activities. However, you can choose to receive these notifications if desired. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Check your Notification Preferences:**\n   - Log in to your XWiki account.\n   - Go to your profile by clicking on your username at the top right corner of the page.\n   - Click on \"Notification preferences\".\n\n2. **Change Notification Settings:**\n   - In the \"Notification preferences\" section, look for the setting that controls notifications for your own actions. This could be something like \"Notify me when I perform an action\".\n   - Change this setting to \"Yes\" or \"Always\", depending on how your XWiki instance is configured.\n\n3. **Save Changes:**\n   - Click on the \"Save\" button to apply your changes.\n\n4. **Check Your Notification Center:**\n   - After making these changes, you should start receiving notifications for your own actions in your notification center (accessible via the bell icon at the top right corner of the page).",

When a blog post is published?\n\nYou can enable or disable all notification types that belong to a particular application by clicking on the bells associated to this application. If some types are enabled and other are disabled inside an application, the switch looks like the next screenshot, meaning that the application&#x27;s notifications are partially enabled:\n\n![NotifUndeterminate.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifUndeterminate.png?rev=1.3)\n\nNote that you only receive notifications that occur after you turn on the notifications types.\n\n",
