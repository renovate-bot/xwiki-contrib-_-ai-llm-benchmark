  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nBased on the provided documents, it seems like you're having trouble with the bell icon for notifications even after installing the \"Notifications Application\" extension in XWiki. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and potentially fix this issue:\n\n1. **Check if all dependent extensions are installed:**\n   According to document [3](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/), the Notifications Application has several dependencies. Ensure that all of these are installed in your wiki. You can check this by going to the \"Extensions\" page in your XWiki administration and verifying that all required extensions are listed as installed.\n\n   If any dependent extensions are missing, you can install them using the following steps (from document [1]):\n   - Log in with a user having Administration rights.\n   - Go to the Administration page and select the Import category.\n   - Follow the on-screen instructions to upload the XAR file for each missing extension.\n   - Click on the uploaded XAR and follow the instructions.\n\n2. **Check if you're using an old version of XWiki:**\n   The Extension Manager is not available in older versions of XWiki. If you're using such a version, you'll need to use the manual installation method (as described in document [1]) to install the Notifications Application and its dependencies.\n\n3. **Check if the Bell icon is enabled in your theme:**\n   Sometimes, themes can override or hide certain elements like the bell icon for notifications. Make sure that your current theme has not disabled this feature.\n\n4. **Check if there are any unread notifications:**\n   The bell icon will only appear if you have at least one unread notification. If all your notifications are marked as read, the bell icon might not show up. You can check your notifications by clicking on the \"Alerts\" menu in the top bar (next to the search bar).\n\nIf none of these steps help resolve the issue, it would be helpful to gather more information about your setup and the exact error message you're encountering. This could include details such as:\n\n- The version of XWiki you're using\n- The theme you're currently employing\n- Any relevant error messages or logs\n\nWith this additional context, I might be able to provide more targeted assistance.",
