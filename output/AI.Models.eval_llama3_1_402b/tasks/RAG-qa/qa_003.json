You may need to contact your XWiki administrator for assistance.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

Then, on the very bottom of the page, you can select the interval between 2 emails. For example, if you choose &quot;Daily&quot; (default), you will receive one email every day with the recap of the events that have happened during the day. Of course, if there were no activity in this period of time, no email is sent.\u00a0\n\nLive notifications emails can be sent to a user. The wiki administrator can also define a &quot;grace time&quot; for live email notifications ; when an event that triggers a notification is sent, the platform will wait for the duration of this grace time before sending a notification email. If during this interval, a new event of the same kind is sent, the two events will be grouped in the same email. You can get more informations on how to configure this feature [here](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HCustomizeliveemailnotificationsgracetime).\n\nOf course, it works only if the user has properly filled her e-mail address.\n\nYou can edit the frequency of your email notifications by using the selector just at the bottom of the notification preferences pane in your profile page :\n\n![notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png?rev=1.4)\n\nThe notifications are sorted by pages and dates, and a table of content summarizes all notifications contained in the email:\n\n![NotifEmailTOC.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailTOC.png?rev=1.3)\n\nA breadcrumb is displayed on top of each notification that concern a page:\n\n![NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png?rev=1.3)\n\n",
