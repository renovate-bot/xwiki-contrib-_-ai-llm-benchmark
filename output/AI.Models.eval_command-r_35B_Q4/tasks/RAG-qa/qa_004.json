  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nTo manage your notifications in XWiki, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to your \"User Profile\" page and find the \"Notifications\" section. You can access this page by clicking on your username or profile picture usually found at the top of the screen and selecting the appropriate option, often named as \"User Profile\" or something similar.\n\n2. In the \"Notifications\" section of your profile, you'll see several tabs corresponding to different types of notifications: \"Alert,\" \"Email,\" \"Application,\" and possibly others. Each tab allows you to configure the settings for that specific type of notification. \n\n3. Under each tab, you'll find various options. The exact options and their labeling may vary depending on your XWiki version, but here's a general explanation:\n\n   - **System Filters:** These are predefined filters that you can only enable or disable. They are typically related to broad categories or specific roles, such as \"All Pages\" or \"Space Administrator.\" Disable the ones you don't want to receive notifications for.\n\n   - **Custom Filters:** These are user-defined filters that allow more granular control. You can edit or delete these filters. Click on the filter's name to modify it or the trash icon to delete it.\n\n4. If you want to create a new filter, look for a button labeled \"Add a new filter,\" \"Create Filter,\" or something similar. This will let you craft a filter according to your preferences. You can create inclusive filters (for pages you want to receive notifications about) or exclusive filters (for pages you want to exclude from notifications).\n\n5. Watching a location, such as a page or a space, may also create notification filters. If you no longer want notifications for a specific location, consider unwatching it. Look for the \"Unwatch\" button or similar wording usually found on the page itself.\n\nRemember that your changes may not take effect immediately, and some XWiki instances may require you to refresh the page or log out and back in to update notification settings.",

So the watch buttons might be in an undecided state if there&#x27;s an existing filter targeting the same location, but only some specific events, or some specific format. The idea is to inform the user that there&#x27;s already a filter for this location and that using the watch buttons might impact the filter.\u00a0\n\nIf a filter is not targeting all event types and all formats, and is actually in contradiction with the filter that would be created by the watch button, then this filter will be automatically disabled when using the watch button. For example, if a user had a filter to ignore all mentions on a space, then watching that exact same space will automatically disable that filter. The user can always review their filters and enable them back.\n\n![notification-watch-undecided.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-watch-undecided.png?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\nXWiki 16.3.0+\u00a0The custom filters are all displayed in a live data which can now be filtered and sorted out:\u00a0\n\n![notification-custom-filters-livedata.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata.png?rev=1.1)  \n![notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\n",
