  "prompt": "How can I deny script right to a space administrator?",
  "expected_answer": "This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/Permission%20types/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/ \n\n\nI found no mention of\u00a0\"space administrator\" or \"script rights\" in the documentation. However, based on my general knowledge, I assume you're referring to XWiki. In XWiki, the scripting right indeed determines whether users can execute arbitrary scripts within a certain space. \n\nTo revoke this permission for someone who currently has it, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in as an Administrator.\n\n2. Access the Administration page: click on the drawer icon and select \"Administer Wiki\".\n\n3. Choose the \"Rights\" option from the vertical menu.\n\n4. Find the user or group you want to edit permissions for; if they are administrators, they will have the \"ADMIN\" permission. You can use the search bar to find them easily.\n\n5. Once you've located their entry, click on it to open their permissions page.\n\n6. Look for the \"SCRIPT\" permission and change it to \"DENY\". \n\nRemember that anyone with \"ADMIN\" rights will always have access to scripts unless their account is deleted or their administrative privileges are removed. So even if you deny them script access, they can always re-allow it. Additionally, the main wiki administrator has implicit scripting permission and cannot be denied this right.",
