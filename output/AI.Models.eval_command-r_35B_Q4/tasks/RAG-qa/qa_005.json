  "prompt": "How can I configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect?\nI've set up OpenID Connect authentication in my XWiki instance, but users are not automatically enabled after their first login. What configuration do I need to adjust?",
  "expected_answer": "To automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect in XWiki, you need to adjust the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nAdd or update the following property:\n\n```\n#-# Define if user accounts should be enabled (marked as active) on first login\n# oidc.enableUser=true\n```\n\nMake sure to uncomment and set the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true`. After making this change, save the file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.\n\nThis will ensure that new user accounts are automatically enabled when they log in for the first time via OpenID Connect.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \n\n\nThe information you provided doesn't seem relevant to your request since it focuses on configuring the XWiki instance for domain-based instances and skip or bypass OpenID Connect altogether. \n\nHowever, based on my general knowledge, this behavior might be attributed to the fact that user account creation and enabling are two separate processes in XWiki. When a user logs in for the first time using OpenID Connect, their account is created, but it's not automatically enabled.\n\nTo enable newly created accounts, you need to manually change their status from \"created\" to \"enabled.\" This can be done either through the XAdmin interface or by using the API. \n\nAccessing XAdmin interface:\n\n1. Log in to your XWiki instance as an administrator.\n\n2. Navigate to the XAdmin page: usually, it's accessible at http://yourinstance.com/xwiki/bin/view/XAdmin.\n\n3. Locate the \"Users\" section and find the newly created user.\n\n4. Change the user status from \"created\" to \"enabled.\"\n\nUsing the API:\nYou can use the following HTTP request to enable a user account. Make sure to replace `http://yourinstance.com` with your actual XWiki instance URL and the username accordingly.\n\n```bash\nPOST http://yourinstance.com/xwiki/rest/json/1/user/<username>/enable\n```\n\nAfter enabling the user account, the user should be able to log in and access XWiki normally.",

      "content": "## Authentication with a domain-based instance\n\nWhen XWiki is configured as a domain-based instance, users will not be automatically authenticated on every wiki by default, as the OIDC authenticator does not rely on the property xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains in xwiki.cfg.\n\nTo still allow users to be automatically authenticated when accessing one of the wikis of the farm, you will have to update the configuration of the session cookie of your servlet container so that this cookie gets set on a top-level domain, encompassing every wiki of farm. If your XWiki instance has very different domains for its wikis, this fix will not work.\n\nWhen using Tomcat as a servlet container, it&#x27;s possible to change the domain of the cookie JSESSIONID by adding the attribute sessionCookieDomain to context.xml as such :\n\n&lt;Context sessionCookieDomain=&quot;mytld.org&quot;&gt;  \n...  \n&lt;/Context&gt;# Endpoints\n\n## Callback\n\npath: **authenticator/callback**\n\n## [Back-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html)\n\npath: **authenticator/backchannel\\_logout**\n\n# Bypass OpenID Connect\n\nAs indicated in the previous section you can disable OpenID Connect using the property oidc.skipped in the xwiki.properties file.\n\nIt&#x27;s also possible to skip OpenId Connect temporarily using a URL parameter: for example https://mydomain/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?oidc.skipped=true.\n\n",
