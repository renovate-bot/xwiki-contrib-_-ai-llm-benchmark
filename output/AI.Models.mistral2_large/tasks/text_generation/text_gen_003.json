  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Sure, let's make it more fun and easier to understand:\n\nPhotosynthesis is like a magic trick that plants do! They take the light from the sun and turn it into special energy that helps them grow big and strong. This energy also helps them make food, just like how we need food to run and play! Isn't that cool? Plants are like little factories that make food using sunlight!",
