  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Sure, let's make that easier to understand!\n\nPhotosynthesis is how plants make their own food. They use the sun's light and turn it into special energy that helps them grow and stay healthy. It's like how we eat food to get energy to run and play! But instead of eating, plants use the sun's light to make their food. Isn't that cool?",
