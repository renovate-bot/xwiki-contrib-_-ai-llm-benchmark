  "ai_answer": "The sunbeams dance on emerald leaves,\nA symphony of light, the forest weaves.\nA gentle breeze through branches sighs,\nWhispering secrets to the azure skies.\n\nA babbling brook, a crystal stream,\nReflects the clouds, a silver gleam.\nWildflowers bloom in vibrant hues,\nA tapestry of color, nature's muse.\n\nThe mountains stand, majestic and grand,\nTheir peaks adorned with snow so white and planned.\nThe ocean roars, a restless might,\nCrashing waves, a breathtaking sight.\n\nFrom towering trees to smallest seed,\nNature's beauty, a wondrous creed.\nA canvas vast, with endless art,\nA masterpiece that fills the soul and heart. \n\n\n",
