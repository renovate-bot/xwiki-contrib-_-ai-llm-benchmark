  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Plants are like tiny food factories! They use a special power called photosynthesis to make their own food. \n\nImagine sunlight as tiny energy balls. Plants catch these energy balls with their leaves and use them to mix water and air, just like baking a cake. This mixing creates sugar, which is the plant's yummy food!  \n\nThis sugar gives the plant energy to grow big and strong, just like the energy you get from eating your lunch! \n\n\n",
