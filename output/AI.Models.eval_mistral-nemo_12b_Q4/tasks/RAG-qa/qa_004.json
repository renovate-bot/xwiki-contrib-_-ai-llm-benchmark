  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nBased on the information provided, here are the steps you can follow to manage your notifications and filters in XWiki:\n\n1. **Disable global notifications**: To reduce the number of notifications you receive, you can disable them globally for some event types or formats (alerts, emails). You can do this by adjusting your notification preferences using the following macro:\n   ```\n   #notificationsFiltersPreferences\n   ```\n\n2. **Manage custom filters**: Custom filters allow you to fine-tune which notifications you want to receive. Here's how you can manage them:\n\n   - **List your custom filters**: Use the `notificationsCustomFiltersPreferences` macro to list your current custom notification filters:\n     ```\n     #notificationsCustomFiltersPreferences\n     ```\n\n   - **Disable or delete specific filters**: To disable or delete a filter, locate it in the list and use the appropriate action (disable/enable button or delete icon).\n\n3. **Manage watch buttons**: Watching a location automatically creates a custom notification filter for that location. If you're receiving too many notifications from watched locations, consider unwatching them:\n\n   - **Unwatch a location**: Click on the \"unwatch\" button next to the page or wiki you want to stop receiving notifications from.\n\n4. **Create new filters**: To further refine which notifications you receive, you can create new custom filters. Here's how:\n\n   - Go to the Notifications application (you might need to enable it first).\n   - Click on \"Add a filter\" in the Filter box.\n   - Choose either a page or wiki, and select whether the filter should be inclusive or exclusive.\n   - Configure the event types and notification formats you want to target for this filter.\n   - Click \"Save\" to create your new filter.\n\nFor more detailed information about managing notifications and filters, you can refer to the official XWiki documentation: <https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications/>",

You can then exclude some pages from your notifications.

So the watch buttons might be in an undecided state if there&#x27;s an existing filter targeting the same location, but only some specific events, or some specific format. The idea is to inform the user that there&#x27;s already a filter for this location and that using the watch buttons might impact the filter.\u00a0\n\nIf a filter is not targeting all event types and all formats, and is actually in contradiction with the filter that would be created by the watch button, then this filter will be automatically disabled when using the watch button. For example, if a user had a filter to ignore all mentions on a space, then watching that exact same space will automatically disable that filter. The user can always review their filters and enable them back.\n\n![notification-watch-undecided.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-watch-undecided.png?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\nXWiki 16.3.0+\u00a0The custom filters are all displayed in a live data which can now be filtered and sorted out:\u00a0\n\n![notification-custom-filters-livedata.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata.png?rev=1.1)  \n![notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\n",
