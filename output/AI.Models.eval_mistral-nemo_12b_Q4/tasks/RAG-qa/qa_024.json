  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that you're receiving unwanted notifications about various pages in your XWiki instance. Here's how you can manage and disable these notifications:\n\n1. **Access your notification preferences:**\n   - Click on your profile picture or username at the top right corner of the page.\n   - Select \"Profile\" from the dropdown menu.\n   - In your profile page, look for the \"Notifications\" section (it might be under \"Preferences\").\n\n2. **Customize your notifications:**\n   - You'll see various notification types and applications listed. By default, you're likely set to receive all notifications, which is why you're getting so many.\n   - To disable notifications about pages you're not interested in, you can:\n     - Deselect the checkboxes next to specific notification types (e.g., \"Page Created\", \"Page Updated\") for applications you're not interested in.\n     - Click on the bell icon next to an application to toggle all its notifications on or off. If some types are enabled and others disabled, it will show a partially filled bell.\n\n3. **Set notification filters:**\n   - You can also set custom notification filters to only receive notifications about specific pages or when certain conditions are met. To do this:\n     - Click on \"Custom Notifications Filters Preferences\" in the \"Notifications\" section.\n     - Define your filter rules and save them.\n\n4. **Change email notification frequency (if applicable):**\n   - If you're receiving too many emails with notifications, you can change the frequency of your email notifications by using the selector at the bottom of the notification preferences pane in your profile page.\n\nAfter making these changes, you should no longer receive unwanted notifications about pages you're not interested in. Keep in mind that it might take some time for the system to apply your new settings, and you'll only receive notifications for events that occur after you've made the changes.",

      "content": "## Emails\n\nYou can also select some types of notifications that you will receive by email. You can have different choices enabled by email and in the menu. Then, on the very bottom of the page, you can select the interval between 2 emails. For example, if you choose &quot;Daily&quot; (default), you will receive one email every day with the recap of the events that have happened during the day. Of course, if there were no activity in this period of time, no email is sent.\u00a0\n\nLive notifications emails can be sent to a user. The wiki administrator can also define a &quot;grace time&quot; for live email notifications ; when an event that triggers a notification is sent, the platform will wait for the duration of this grace time before sending a notification email. If during this interval, a new event of the same kind is sent, the two events will be grouped in the same email. You can get more informations on how to configure this feature [here](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HCustomizeliveemailnotificationsgracetime).\n\nOf course, it works only if the user has properly filled her e-mail address.\n\nYou can edit the frequency of your email notifications by using the selector just at the bottom of the notification preferences pane in your profile page :\n\n![notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png?rev=1.4)\n\nThe notifications are sorted by pages and dates, and a table of content summarizes all notifications contained in the email:\n\n![NotifEmailTOC.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailTOC.png?rev=1.3)\n\nA breadcrumb is displayed on top of each notification that concern a page:\n\n![NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png?rev=1.3)\n\n",

This feed can be accessed either through a link in your notification tray (or at the bottom of the notifications macro).\n\n![NotificationTrayRSSLink.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotificationTrayRSSLink.png?rev=1.3)  \n![NotificationsWithRSS.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotificationsWithRSS.png?rev=1.3)\n\n## Notifications Macro\n\nThe [Notifications Macro is provided by its own application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Macro/).\n\n# Settings\n\nOn the notifications menu, you also have a link to go to the &quot;settings&quot; of the notifications.\n\n![notif4.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notif4.png?rev=1.8)\n\nBy default, users only get notifications when they are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated. For receiving other notifications, you need to select which &quot;types&quot; of notifications you want to receive. When a page is created? When a blog post is published?\n\nYou can enable or disable all notification types that belong to a particular application by clicking on the bells associated to this application. If some types are enabled and other are disabled inside an application, the switch looks like the next screenshot, meaning that the application&#x27;s notifications are partially enabled:\n\n![NotifUndeterminate.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifUndeterminate.png?rev=1.3)\n\nNote that you only receive notifications that occur after you turn on the notifications types.\n\n",
