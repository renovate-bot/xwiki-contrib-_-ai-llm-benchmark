  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nBased on the provided information, here are some steps you can take to ensure you're receiving notifications in XWiki:\n\n1. **Check if the Notifications Application is installed**: The Notifications Application allows you to receive notifications in the top bar under the 'Alert' entry (represented by a bell). This application was introduced in XWiki 9.3 and later, so make sure it's enabled:\n   - Go to the Extension Manager.\n   - Search for 'Notifications Application'.\n   - Click on 'Install' if it's not already installed.\n\n2. **Configure your notification preferences**: You can manage your notification preferences using various macros. Here are a few relevant ones:\n   - **[notifications](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Notifications/Code/Macro/NotificationsMacro)**: Display notifications about events happened on the wiki.\n   - **[notificationsEmailPreferences](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Notifications/Code/NotificationsEmailPreferencesMacro)**: Display and manage your notification email preferences.\n\n3. **Check if you're auto-watching pages**: You might want to ensure that you're auto-watching the pages you're interested in:\n   - Use the **[notificationsAutoWatchPreferences](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Notifications/Code/NotificationsAutoWatchPreferencesMacro)** macro to manage your auto-watch preferences.\n\n4. **Review your custom notification filters**: You can create custom filters to refine the notifications you receive:\n   - Use the **[notificationsCustomFiltersPreferences](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Notifications/Code/NotificationsCustomFiltersPreferencesMacro)** macro to manage your custom notification filters.\n\nIf you've checked all these points and are still not receiving notifications, it might be helpful to check the XWiki logs for any error messages related to notifications. You can also reach out to the XWiki community or support for further assistance.",
