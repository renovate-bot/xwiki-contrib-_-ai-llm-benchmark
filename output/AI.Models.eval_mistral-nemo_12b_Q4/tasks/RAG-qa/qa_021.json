  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that you're having trouble accessing the bell icon (Notifications) at the top right corner even after installing the \"Notification Alerts\" extension in XWiki.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Notifications Application is enabled:**\n   - Go to your profile by clicking on your username at the top right corner.\n   - Click on \"Applications\" in the left-hand menu.\n   - Make sure that \"Notifications Application\" is checked under the \"Installed Applications\" section.\n\n2. **Check if you're watching anything:**\n   - In your profile, go to the \"Network\" tab.\n   - If there's nothing listed under \"Followed Users\", it means you're not currently watching any events. Try following a user or enabling notifications for specific applications to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n3. **Verify if you've enabled any application types for notifications:**\n   - In your profile, go to the \"Notifications\" tab.\n   - Make sure at least one application type (e.g., Mention) is enabled under \"Application Types\".\n\n4. **Check if you're using the latest version of XWiki and the Notifications Application:**\n   - The behavior of default watch settings changed in XWiki 15.5+. Ensure that both your XWiki installation and the Notifications Application are up-to-date.\n\nIf none of these steps help, it might be a good idea to reach out to the XWiki community or their support for further assistance, as they can provide more specific guidance tailored to your situation.",
