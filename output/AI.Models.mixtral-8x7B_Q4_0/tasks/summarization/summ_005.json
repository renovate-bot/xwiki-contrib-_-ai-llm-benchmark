The default wiki (extensions might provide more) provides the following RSS feeds:\n\n* Feed for all modified pages. This is available from the [Notifications Application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/).\n* Feed for all Blog posts. This is available if your wiki has the [Blog application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Blog%20Application) installed.\n* Feeds for Search results. This is available if your wiki has the [Search application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Search%20Application) installed.\n* Feeds on Tags. This is available if your wiki has the [Tag application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Tag%20Application) installed.\n* The [Watchlist Feature](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Watchlist%20Application) allows you to get a RSS feed of all the modifications to the pages in your Watchlist.\n\nNote that you can choose to start receiving information from the Blog and modified pages feeds by using your browser's RSS notification button. For example on Firefox:\n\n![rss.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RSS/rss.png?rev=1.1)\n\n# Customized RSS Feeds\n\nEven more so, it's easy to create new RSS feeds to fit a specific need (or modify existing RSS feeds):\n\n* You can also easily create your own page that outputs RSS (Atom, RDF, etc). Edit the Main.WebRss page in your wiki to see how it's implemented and do the same in your own page.\n* You can also modify the existing RSS pages (e.g. Main.WebRss) if you wish to customize the default RSS content produced by the various applications.\n\n\n",

  "ai_answer": "\n\n XWiki, a wiki platform, provides several default RSS feeds to keep users notified of activity taking place on an XWiki instance. These feeds include notifications for all modified pages, blog posts, search results, tags, and changes to pages in the Watchlist. The Blog application, Search application, and Tag application must be installed to use their respective feeds. Users can choose to receive information from the Blog and modified pages feeds using their browser's RSS notification button.\n\nCustomized RSS feeds can also be easily created or modified to fit specific needs in XWiki. To create a new RSS feed, users can edit a page to output RSS (Atom, RDF, etc.), and the Main.WebRss page in their wiki serves as an example of implementation. Existing RSS pages such as Main.WebRss can also be modified to customize the default RSS content produced by various applications.\n\nSources:\n[Available Feeds](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RSS#HAvailableFeeds)\n[Customized RSS Feeds](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RSS#HCustomizedRSSFeeds)",
