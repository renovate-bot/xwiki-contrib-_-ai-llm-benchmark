We divided into 3 different parts depending on whether you're a user, an administrator or a developer. Here goes:\n\n\n\n| **If you're a User** | In order to perform the following actions, you may need to log in. Please ask your administrator for your login credentials. Learn more about:* [Creating a page](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/CreatingAPage) * [Editing a page](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/EditingAPage) * [Page history](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/PageHistory) |\n| --- | --- |\n| **If you're an Administrator** | As an Admin, you may want to get started with the following steps:* [Changing the logo and the panels](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/ChangingTheLogoAndThePanels) * [Creating new users](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/CreatingNewUsers) * [Setting user rights](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/SettingUserRights) |\n| **If you're a Developer** | XWiki is also a second generation wiki. You can build simple applications, extend the platform with custom plugins, or even build complex Web applications. The Getting Started guide only covers basic use cases for users and admins, however, there are plenty of resources for Developers as well in the documentation. XWiki's powerful programming features are documented in the [Developer's Guide](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/). A number of applications are pre-installed but additional applications, macros and other extensions are available on the [Extensions wiki](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/). The documentation for the [XWiki Rendering](https://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/) has a [dedicated wiki](https://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/).For documentation related to the development of XWiki itself, visit the [XWiki Development Zone](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/). |\n\n**Next: [Step 1 Creating a page](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/CreatingAPage)**\n\n\n",

  "ai_answer": "\n\n According to the text, XWiki provides guidance for different types of users: regular users, administrators, and developers. Here's a summary of what each group can do:\n\n* **Users:** Users who have logged in can perform actions such as creating new pages, editing existing pages, and viewing page history. Specific links for these tasks are provided in the text.\n* **Administrators:** Administrators can make changes to the XWiki site's appearance and settings by changing the logo and panels, creating new users, and setting user rights. Again, specific links for these tasks are provided.\n* **Developers:** Developers who want to build applications or extend the XWiki platform have access to XWiki's powerful programming features, which are documented in the Developer's Guide. Additional resources such as pre-installed applications and macros, and extensions can be found on the Extensions wiki, while documentation for developing XWiki itself is available on the XWiki Development Zone.\n\nThe text also provides a link to the next section of the guide, which covers step 1, \"Creating a page.\"\n\nSource: [XWiki User Guide](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/)",
