According to this theory, a massive star can collapse directly into a black hole without going through the intermediate phase of a supernova explosion, provided that the conditions are just right.\n\nUsing advanced computer simulations, the team has shown that these conditions could indeed arise in the early universe, under certain circumstances. Specifically, they found that if a cloud of gas is sufficiently massive and isolated from other nearby matter, it can avoid fragmenting into smaller stars and instead form a single, supermassive black hole.\n\nThis discovery has important implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, as well as the role that black holes play in these processes. The study's lead author, Dr. Jane Doe, from the University of Somewhere, said: \"Our findings provide strong evidence for the 'direct collapse' scenario and pave the way for further exploration of this fascinating topic.\"\n\nYou can read more about this exciting discovery in the June 2023 issue of Nature Astronomy or visit their website at <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01876-z> for access to the full article.\n\n(Please note that I cannot provide a real link as I am an AI language model, and I don't have real-time internet access.)",
