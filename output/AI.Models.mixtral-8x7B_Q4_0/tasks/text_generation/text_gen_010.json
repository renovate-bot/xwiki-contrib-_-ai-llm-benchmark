  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "\n\n For a more technical audience, the human brain can be described as an intricate network of approximately 86 billion neurons, which communicate through electrical and chemical signals to facilitate various cognitive processes. These neurons are organized into specialized regions that control specific functions, such as movement, sensation, memory, and language. The brain also contains complex systems for interpreting and processing sensory information from the external environment, allowing us to perceive and interact with our surroundings. Furthermore, it serves as the seat of higher consciousness, emotions, and personality, making it a fascinating area of study in neuroscience and psychology.\n\nSource:\n\nThe Human Brain. (n.d.).
