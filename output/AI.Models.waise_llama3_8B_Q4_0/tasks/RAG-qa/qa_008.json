  "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5. Repeat for each (sub)wiki for which you need to set this configuration!",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Attachments \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Attachment/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments \n\n\nTo ensure that only images or PDF files of a maximum size of 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, you need to implement file validation using the `xwiki:actions:beforeUpload` event.\n\nHere's an example of how you can achieve this:\n```javascript\n$(document).on('xwiki:actions:beforeUpload', function(event, data) {\n  var file = data.file;\n  var fileName = file.name.toLowerCase();\n  var allowedExtensions = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'pdf'];\n  var allowedMimeTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'];\n\n  if ($.inArray(fileName.split('.')[1], allowedExtensions) < 0 || $.inArray(file.type, allowedMimeTypes) < 0) {\n    new XWiki.widgets.Notification('Only images and PDF files of maximum 10MB are allowed.', 'error');\n    event.preventDefault();\n  } else if (file.size > 10485760) { // 10MB\n    new XWiki.widgets.Notification('File size exceeds the limit. Please try again with a smaller file.', 'error');\n    event.preventDefault();\n  }\n});\n```\nThis code checks the file extension and MIME type to ensure it's an allowed image or PDF file, and also checks the file size to ensure it doesn't exceed 10MB. If either of these conditions is not met, it displays an error message and prevents the upload.\n\nNote that this code needs to be added to your wiki's JavaScript files, typically in a `xwiki.js` file located in the `WEB-INF/` directory. You can also add it to a custom JavaScript file and include it in your wiki's configuration.",

If you need only latest versions of attachments, you can disable attachment version control by editing your [xwiki.cfg](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Configuration/) and adding:\n\nxwiki.store.attachment.versioning=0# Deletion\n\nDeleted attachments are stored in a recycle bin so that they can be restored along with the document when rolling back or previewing an earlier version where the attachment should be visible. To disable this feature, edit [xwiki.cfg](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Configuration/) and add:\n\nstorage.attachment.recyclebin=0You can view the list of deleted attachments in your wiki and delete them permanently by going to XWiki.DeletedAttachments in your wiki.\n\n# Attachment Storage\n\nXWiki offers plugin attachment storage mechanisms so you can store your attachments in the database or directly in the filesystem.\n\nGenerally metadata for attachment and deleted attachments stay in the database whatever store is used for the content. The metadata contains the type of store used for the content allowing each attachment to choose a different store. The consequence is that what you configure is the **default** store for a new attachment and not the store used for all attachments.\n\n",

Log in the wiki with a user having Administration rights\n2. Go to the Administration page and select the Import category\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload the downloaded XAR\n4.
