  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": " Sure thing! Here's a simpler version for kids:\n\nPhotosynthesis is like a magic trick that plants use to make their own food. They take in sunlight, which is like their special ingredient, and then they use it to make energy that helps them grow, just like how you need food to grow big and strong! So, when you see a plant, remember that it's working hard to turn sunlight into its very own lunch!",
