  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nThe issue you're encountering might be due to missing dependencies or incorrect installation steps for the Alert Notifications application in your XWiki setup.\n\nHere are some troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies required by the Alert Notifications application are correctly installed and up-to-date. You can find these dependencies listed on the extension's page at [Alerts Application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Alerts%20Application/) or in the documentation provided.\n\n2. **Reinstall Dependencies**: If any of the dependencies mentioned are missing, you should install them first before installing the Alert Notifications application. This includes extensions like `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-notifications-ui`, `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-notifications-preferences-default`, and others listed in the dependency section.\n\n3. **Correct Installation**: Make sure that you have followed all steps correctly during installation, especially when using the Extension Manager or manual method:\n   - Log into your XWiki wiki with an account having Administration rights.\n   - Go to the Administration page and select the Import category.\n   - Upload the downloaded XAR file for Alert Notifications application following on-screen instructions.\n\n4. **Check Configuration**: Ensure that there are no configuration issues preventing the Alert Notifications from functioning properly. This might include settings related to permissions, server configurations, or specific XWiki versions compatibility.\n\n5. **Update XWiki**: Sometimes, issues can be due to using an outdated version of XWiki. Consider updating your XWiki installation to the latest stable release.\n\n6. **Check Logs**: Review logs for any error messages that could provide clues about what might be going wrong with the Alert Notifications application.\n\n7. **Contact Support**: If you've followed all these steps and are still experiencing issues, consider reaching out to XWiki support or community forums for further assistance. They can offer more specific guidance based on your setup details.\n\nRemember, it's crucial that each dependency is correctly installed and compatible with your version of XWiki to ensure the Alert Notifications application functions as expected.",
