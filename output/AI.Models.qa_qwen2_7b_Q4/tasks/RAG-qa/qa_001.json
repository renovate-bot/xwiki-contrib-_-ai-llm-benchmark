  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nThe issue you're encountering might be due to missing dependencies or incorrect installation steps for the Alert Notifications application in your XWiki setup.\n\nHere are some troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies required by the Alert Notifications application are correctly installed and up-to-date. You can find these dependencies listed under \"HDependencies\" on the extension's page at [Alert Notifications Extension](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/User%20Module/User%20Profile%20Application/). Install any missing extensions.\n\n2. **Correct Installation**: Make sure you have installed the Alert Notifications application correctly following these steps:\n   - Log in to your XWiki instance with an account that has administrative privileges.\n   - Go to the Administration page and select the Import category.\n   - Follow the on-screen instructions to upload the downloaded XAR file for the Alert Notifications extension.\n\n3. **Configuration**: After installation, you might need to configure some settings within the Alert Notifications application itself or through system-wide configurations in your XWiki setup.\n\n4. **Check Logs**: Look into the logs of your XWiki instance (usually found under `/logs/` directory) for any error messages related to the Alert Notifications extension that could provide clues about what's going wrong.\n\n5. **Update XWiki**: Ensure that you are running on a version of XWiki that is compatible with the Alert Notifications application and all its dependencies. Sometimes, issues can be resolved by updating your XWiki instance to the latest stable release.\n\n6. **Contact Support**: If none of these steps resolve the issue, consider reaching out to the XWiki community or support forums for further assistance. They might have encountered similar issues before and could provide specific guidance based on your setup.\n\nRemember that proper installation and configuration are crucial in any software setup, especially when dealing with complex systems like XWiki.",
