  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/Permission%20types/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/NestedPagesMigration/ \n\n\nTo deny script execution rights to a Space Administrator in your application, you need to modify the permissions associated with their role. The exact steps will depend on the specific platform or framework you are using (e.g., Java EE, Node.js, Django, etc.). Here's an example of how you might do this for a Node.js application using Express and MongoDB:\n\n1. **Identify the Role**: First, determine which role(s) grant script execution rights to Space Administrators in your system.\n\n2. **Modify Permissions**: You'll need to adjust the permissions associated with that role. This typically involves updating the middleware or access control logic that checks for these permissions.\n\nHere's an example using Express and MongoDB:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\n// Connect to your MongoDB database\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });\n\n// Load models (assuming you have a User model)\nconst User = require('./models/User');\nconst SpaceAdminRole = require('./models/SpecialRoles');\n\n// Middleware to check if the user has script execution rights\nfunction canExecuteScripts(req, res, next) {\n  const userId = req.user._id;\n  // Find the role associated with the user ID and check if it includes 'Space Administrator' AND 'Script Execution'\n  User.findById(userId)\n    .populate('specialRoles') // Assuming special roles are stored in a separate collection\n    .then(user => {\n      return SpaceAdminRole.findOne({ name: 'Space Administrator', users: userId })\n        .then(role => {\n          if (!role) {\n            res.status(403).send('You do not have permission to execute scripts.');\n          } else {\n            const hasScriptExecutionPermission = role.permissions.some(permission => permission === 'executeScripts');\n            if (hasScriptExecutionPermission) {\n              next();\n            } else {\n              res.status(403).send('You are a Space Administrator but do not have script execution rights.');\n            }\n          }\n        });\n    })\n    .catch(err => res.status(500).send(`Error checking permissions: ${err}`));\n}\n\n// Example route that checks if the user can execute scripts\napp.get('/execute-script', canExecuteScripts, (req, res) => {\n  // Your script execution logic here...\n});\n\n// Start your server\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\napp.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));\n```\n\nThis example assumes you have a MongoDB collection for `User` and another for `SpecialRoles`, where each role can be associated with specific permissions.\n\n**Note**: The above code is just an example to illustrate the concept. You'll need to adapt it based on your actual application's structure, including how roles are defined and managed in your system.\n\n3. **Test Your Changes**: After making these changes, test the route that checks for script execution rights with a Space Administrator user account to ensure they can no longer execute scripts as expected.\n\n4. **Document Your Changes**: Make sure to document any modifications you've made to permissions or access control logic so that others on your team are aware of them and can understand how these changes impact the system's security and functionality.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to effectively deny script execution rights to Space Administrators in your application.",
