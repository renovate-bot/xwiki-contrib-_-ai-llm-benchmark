  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "Here's a revised version of the text tailored to a more technical audience:\n\nThe human brain is a highly intricate and dynamic organ that serves as the central processing unit of the nervous system, regulating a vast array of physiological processes, integrating sensory information from the environment, and facilitating cognitive functions that underlie perception, consciousness, and behavior.\n\nNote that I've used more technical terms and phrases, such as \"central processing unit of the nervous system\", \"physiological processes\", \"integrating sensory information\", and \"cognitive functions\", to convey the same idea in a more precise and formal manner. I've also avoided using more subjective and philosophical terms like \"essence of the mind and soul\", which may not be suitable for a technical audience.",
