  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "Here is a revised version of the text, adapted for a more technical audience:\n\nThe human brain is a highly intricate and dynamic system that serves as the central control unit for the body's physiological processes, integrating and processing sensory information from the environment through complex neural networks, and giving rise to the emergent properties of cognition, consciousness, and behavioral regulation.\n\nNote that I've used more technical terms and concepts to convey the same ideas as the original text, such as:\n\n* \"central control unit\" instead of \"controls all functions of the body\"\n* \"integrating and processing sensory information\" instead of \"interprets information from the outside world\"\n* \"emergent properties\" instead of \"embodies the essence of the mind and soul\" to convey the idea that the brain's complex processes give rise to higher-level phenomena such as cognition and consciousness.",
