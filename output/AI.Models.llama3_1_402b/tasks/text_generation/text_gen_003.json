  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Here's a version of the text that's easier for 8-10 year olds to understand:\n\n\"Have you ever wondered how plants grow and thrive, even though they don't eat food like we do? It's because they make their own food! Plants use energy from sunlight, water, and air to create a kind of sugar that gives them the energy they need to grow big and strong. This magic process is called photosynthesis. It's like a special power that plants have to turn sunlight into energy, and it's what makes them healthy and happy!\"",
