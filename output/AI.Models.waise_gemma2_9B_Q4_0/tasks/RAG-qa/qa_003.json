Note that installing Extensions when being offline is currently not supported and you&#x27;d need to use some [complex manual method](https://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/#HOthermethods).\n\nYou can also use the following manual method, which is useful if this extension cannot be installed with the Extension Manager or if you&#x27;re using an old version of XWiki that doesn&#x27;t have the Extension Manager:\n\n1. Log in the wiki with a user having Administration rights\n2. Go to the Administration page and select the Import category\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload the downloaded XAR\n4. Click on the uploaded XAR and follow the instructions\n5. You&#x27;ll also need to install all [dependent Extensions](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HDependencies) that are not already installed in your wiki\n\n",
