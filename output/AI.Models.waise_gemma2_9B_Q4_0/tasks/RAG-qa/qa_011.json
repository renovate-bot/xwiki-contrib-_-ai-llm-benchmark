  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIt sounds like you're having trouble with the notification bell icon in XWiki. \n\nWhile I don't have access to your specific XWiki installation, here are some common reasons why the notification bell might not be visible:\n\n* **Extension Not Enabled:**  Make sure the \"Notifications Application\" extension is actually enabled in your XWiki instance.  \n* **Permissions:** You might not have the necessary permissions to see notifications. Check your user account settings.\n* **Caching:** Try clearing your browser cache and cookies. Sometimes outdated information can cause display issues.\n* **Theme or Skin:**  Your current XWiki theme might be overriding the notification bell icon. Try switching to a different theme to see if that helps.\n\n**To troubleshoot further:**\n\n1. **Check the XWiki Administrator Panel:** Go to the XWiki administrator panel and look for the \"Notifications Application\" extension. Verify that it's enabled and configured correctly.\n2. **Review User Permissions:**  Make sure your user account has the necessary permissions to view notifications.\n3. **Contact XWiki Support:** If you're still having trouble, reach out to the XWiki support team for assistance. They can provide more specific guidance based on your XWiki setup. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! \n",
