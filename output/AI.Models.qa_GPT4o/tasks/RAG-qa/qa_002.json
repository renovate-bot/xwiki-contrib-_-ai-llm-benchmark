  "prompt": "Why am I not receiving any notifications in XWiki.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RSS \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \n\n\nThere could be several reasons why you're not receiving notifications in XWiki. Here are some possibilities and solutions:\n\n1. **Default Settings**:\n   - If you are a new user on XWiki version 15.5 or later, by default, nothing is watched, although all application types are enabled. You need to start watching something to begin receiving notifications. For versions prior to 15.5, the whole wiki is watched by default, but no application types are enabled except specific ones like Mentions.\n\n2. **Notification Preferences**:\n   - Ensure that you have enabled the types of notifications you want to receive. You can manage this in your notification settings by selecting different event types (e.g., when a page is created, a blog post is published, etc.). You can access these settings through the notifications menu.\n\n3. **Notification Filters**:\n   - Check if there are any active filters that might be preventing notifications. For instance, filters for hidden pages or minor events might stop you from receiving certain notifications. You can manage and disable these filters in the \"Advanced filtering options\" of your notification settings.\n\n4. **Watching Users or Pages**:\n   - Make sure you are watching the users or pages you are interested in to receive notifications about their activities. You can do this by visiting user profiles and choosing to follow them.\n\n5. **Email Settings**:\n   - If you're expecting email notifications, verify that your email settings are configured correctly. Also, check the frequency at which you receive emails, as this might be set to a lower frequency like daily or weekly.\n\n6. **Check Admin Settings**:\n   - If you are an administrator, ensure that the default settings for notifications are correctly configured in the administration panel. You can specify which events should trigger notifications for all users by default.\n\nIf none of these solutions resolve your issue, there might be a technical problem or a specific configuration issue in your XWiki instance. In such cases, consulting the system administrator or referring to the XWiki documentation for troubleshooting steps might be necessary.",
