  "prompt": "Can I authenticate users with access tokens?",
  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can authenticate users with access tokens using the Token-based authentication for the LLM Application extension.\n\nThis extension allows external applications to authenticate users with signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The token needs to contain specific claims, such as expiration time, issuer, subject, and audience, and must be signed with an Ed25519 key.\n\nTo use this authenticator, you need to:\n\n1. Enable the token authenticator by setting the `xwiki.authentication.authclass` property in `xwiki.properties` file to `org.xwiki.contrib.llm.authentication.JWTTokenAuth`.\n2. Configure the authorized applications by adding a new entry to the \"Authorized Applications\" list, specifying the application's title, URL, public key, and group format.\n3. Generate a JWT token that meets the required claims and signing key requirements.\n4. Include the token in the \"Authorization\" header of the request in the form \"Bearer TOKEN\".\n\nNote that this authenticator only supports creating or updating users based on the information provided in the token and does not support using a token as authentication for an existing user that hasn't been created through this authenticator.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/Authenticator/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LLM%20Application/Authenticator/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Authentication/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LLM%20Application/Index%20for%20the%20LLM%20Application/ \n\n\nYes, you can authenticate users using access tokens in XWiki by employing several methods, depending on your setup and requirements:\n\n1. **JWT Token Authentication**: You can authenticate users with signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This method allows users to be directly created or updated based on the information provided in the token. You would need to configure the XWiki to use this token authenticator by setting the `xwiki.authentication.authclass` property in the `xwiki.properties` file to `org.xwiki.contrib.llm.authentication.JWTTokenAuth`. More details are available in the [LLM Application Authenticator extension documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LLM%20Application/Authenticator/).\n\n2. **OpenID Connect Authentication**: This method involves using the OpenID Connect protocol, which is a secure and standardized way to authenticate users. The access tokens obtained through this process can include various claims about the user (e.g., profile, email, address) and allow for single sign-on capabilities. You can configure this using the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension. More details can be found in the [OpenID Connect Authenticator documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/).\n\nEach of these methods requires specific configurations and setup steps in XWiki. Make sure to follow the respective extension documentation to properly implement the authentication method of your choice.",

To avoid that external applications create users with groups like XWikiAdminGroup that would grant admin right on the wiki, it is highly recommended to configure a unique prefix and possibly also suffix, e.g., by using &quot;Example${group}Group&quot; where ${group} will be replaced by the group name that is provided in the token.\n\n![Screenshot of an authorized application entry](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/LLM%20Application/Authenticator/WebHome/ExampleApplication.png?width=650&amp;height=435&amp;rev=1.1)\n\n",

If it fails it falls back to the standard XWiki authentication.\n\nTo configure XWiki to use it, specify:\n\nxwiki.authentication.authclass=com.xpn.xwiki.user.impl.xwiki.AppServerTrustedAuthServiceImplFor users to be actually created and not just set as context user you must set in xwiki.cfg configuration file (if the property does not already exist, create it):\n\nxwiki.authentication.createuser=empty## OpenId Connect Authentication\n\nSee the [OpenId Connect Authenticator Extension](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/).\n\n## Active Directory\n\nIf you&#x27;re looking to connect XWiki to an Active Directory server, you currently have 2 options:\n\n* Using the manual and generic approach using the [LDAP Authenticator extension](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/Authenticator/)\n* Using the dedicated [Active Directory Application](https://store.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/ActiveDirectoryApplication) which is a paying application dedicated to simplifying the integration of Active Directory with XWiki. The Active Directory Application allows you to easily connect your Active Directory server to XWiki using a **visual editor**, update\u00a0**advanced configuration** settings without restarting the application server, **technical support** provided by [XWiki SAS](https://xwiki.com/), etc.\n\n## LDAP\n\nSee the [LDAP Authenticator extension](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/Authenticator/).\n\nThe deprecated LDAP core authenticator (for XWiki &lt; 7.4) can be found on [OldLDAPAuthenticator](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Authentication/OldLDAPAuthenticator/).\n\n",
