  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIf the notifications bell is not showing in XWiki, even after installing the Alert Notification extension, there are a few things you can check and try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**: Ensure that the Notifications Application and all its dependencies are correctly installed. You can use the Extension Manager to check if the installation was successful. You may also want to manually check that all dependencies listed [here](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HDependencies) are installed.\n\n2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to view notifications. Sometimes, the visibility of UI elements is restricted based on user role or permissions.\n\n3. **JavaScript Settings**: The notifications feature relies on JavaScript to function properly. Make sure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.\n\n4. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser to see if the issue persists. Sometimes, cached data can cause UI elements to not display correctly.\n\n5. **XWiki Version Compatibility**: Confirm that the version of the Notifications Application is compatible with your version of XWiki. You may need to update either XWiki or the extension itself.\n\n6. **Configuration Settings**: Check the configuration settings in the `xwiki.properties` file or in the Administration settings under Notifications. Ensure that notifications are enabled.\n\n7. **Troubleshoot Logs**: Check the XWiki logs for any errors related to the Notifications Application. This may provide insight if there is a problem with the extension.\n\n8. **Consult Documentation**: Review the [Notifications Application documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/) for any additional setup instructions or troubleshooting tips.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the missing notifications bell in XWiki.",
