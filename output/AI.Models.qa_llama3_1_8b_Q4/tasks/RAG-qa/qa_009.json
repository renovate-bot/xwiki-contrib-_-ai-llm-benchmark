That being said, if you still want to do this, here's how:\n\n1.  Go to your Confluence site and log in with an administrator account.\n2.  Navigate to the space for which you want to modify permissions.\n3.  Click on \"Space Settings\" (gear icon) within the top right corner of the screen.\n4.  Select \"Permissions\" from the dropdown menu.\n5.  Locate the Space Administrator's username in the list and click on the \"Deny\" button next to their permissions.\n\n    **Note:** Before doing this, ensure that you have another user with the necessary permissions to manage the space.\n\n6.  A confirmation message will be displayed; review it carefully before proceeding.\n7.  Confirm your decision to deny script right to the Space Administrator by clicking \"Confirm.\"\n\nAfter completing these steps, the Space Administrator's ability to execute scripts within the designated space will be disabled.",

      "content": "Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to use the new checkAccess() method everywhere you check an access before action. And you should refrain to catch the resulting exception, this should be done at higher level, by the UI which will therefore be able to centralize all access check violations. (Obviously this is a work in progress that we are starting now and will only properly work when the full migration of the old service is completed). Also note that, access violation done during checkAccess() are logged. In most situation, this should not happen, since the UI, or earlier code have already checked the possibility for access, and does not provide a path to the prohibited action. Remember also, that checking the same access several time is no more cost full, so checking access very near the action (even if you think there is no reason it would be denied) is good security measure to prevent security bugs. This is clearly the purpose of the checkAccess() method.\n\n## Some definitions as seen by this module\n\n",

While hasAccess() method will simply provide true/false answer, the checkAccess() method does not need any return value check, since it will throw an AccessDeniedException if the resulting access has been denied.\n\nIn the old right service, there were no distinction between access check for UI purposes, and access check for really proceeding to action. Only the hasAccess() method was provided. Missing this distinction is not good because:\n\n* it does not allow easily finding all critical security access check points where access is checked for ensuring security.\n* it leave the responsibility of properly checking return values by the caller at these security check point.\n* it leave the burden of managing access denied situation individually in all those security check points by the caller.\n\n",
