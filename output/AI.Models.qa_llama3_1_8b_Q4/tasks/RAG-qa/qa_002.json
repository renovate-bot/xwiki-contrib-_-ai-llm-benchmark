  "prompt": "Why am I not receiving any notifications in XWiki.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \n\n\nIt seems like you're referring to a feature within XWiki, but the provided snippet about notifications doesn't mention specific reasons for not receiving notifications.\n\nHowever, considering general IT practices, there could be several reasons why you're not getting notified:\n\n* **Notification module disabled**: Check if the notification module is enabled on your platform. It might have been disabled by an administrator.\n* **Email notifications disabled**: Ensure that email notifications are enabled. This can be a setting in xwiki.properties or elsewhere in your system configuration.\n* **Notifications email address incorrect**: Double-check that you've entered the correct email address for receiving notifications.\n* **Filters blocking notifications**: There could be filters or rules set up on your email client (e.g., spam filters, vacation responders) that are preventing the notification emails from reaching you.\n* **Technical issues with the server**: Sometimes, there might be technical difficulties with the server where XWiki is hosted. This could include issues with the mail server configuration.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I would recommend checking these possible causes one by one and verifying if they resolve your problem. If none of them seem to work or you're unsure how to proceed, feel free to provide more details about your situation, and I'll do my best to assist you further!",
