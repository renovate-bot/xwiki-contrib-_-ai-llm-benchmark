  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nBased on the search results, to have the bell icon (notifications menu) working properly in XWiki, you need to ensure that both the **Alerts Application** and the **Notifications Application** are installed, as they work together. The Notifications Application contributes the content to the Alert menu (bell icon) in the top bar.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1. Verify that both extensions are installed:\n   - Alerts Application\n   - Notifications Application\n\n2. Make sure all dependencies are properly installed. The Notifications Application has several required dependencies, including:\n   - All the notifications-related modules\n   - The User Profile Application\n   - The Alerts UI module\n   - Various other dependencies listed in the search results\n\n3. If you're installing manually, follow these steps:\n   1. Log in with administrator rights\n   2. Go to the Administration page\n   3. Select the Import category\n   4. Install both extensions and their dependencies\n   5. Restart your wiki if needed\n\nIf after installing both extensions and their dependencies you still don't see the bell icon, you might want to:\n- Clear your browser cache\n- Verify that your user has the proper rights to see notifications\n- Check your XWiki version is compatible with these extensions\n- Check the XWiki logs for any potential errors\n\nIf the problem persists, you might want to consult the XWiki forums or documentation for more specific troubleshooting steps.",
