  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nBased on the search results, I can help you manage your notifications in XWiki. Here's how you can handle this situation:\n\n### Understanding the Default Behavior\n- In XWiki versions before 15.5, the whole wiki is watched by default for new users, which can lead to receiving many unwanted notifications\n- In XWiki 15.5+, nothing is watched by default for new users\n\n### How to Manage Your Notifications\n\n1. **Access Notification Settings**:\n   - Click on the notifications menu\n   - Look for and click the \"settings\" link\n\n2. **Disable Notification Types**:\n   - You can enable/disable specific types of notifications\n   - Look for the bell icons associated with each application\n   - Click the bells to disable notifications for entire applications you're not interested in\n\n3. **Configure Filters**:\n   - You can add filters to reduce the number of notifications\n   - By default, you can filter out:\n     - Minor events\n     - Your own events\n     - Events you've marked as read\n\n4. **Stop Watching Specific Areas**:\n   - Review what pages/spaces you're currently watching\n   - Unwatch areas you're not interested in\n\n### Important Note\n- Changes you make to notification settings will only affect future notifications\n- You'll still receive notifications for things you explicitly follow or when you're mentioned\n- By default, you only receive notifications when:\n  - You are mentioned\n  - Actions are performed on pages you created or updated\n\nThese adjustments should help reduce the number of unwanted notifications you receive.",
