  "prompt": "Can I customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki?\nI want to map additional user profile fields from my OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. How can I achieve this?",
  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider by mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nTo map additional user profile fields, use the `oidc.user.mapping` property. Here's an example of how to map custom properties:\n\n```\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}\n```\n\nReplace `myxproperty1` and `myxproperty2` with the actual XWiki user property names, and `${oidc.user.subject}` with the appropriate variable based on the data provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n\nAfter configuring the mappings, save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart XWiki to apply the changes.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Authentication/ \n\n\nYes, you can customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. The OpenID Connect Authenticator extension for XWiki allows you to map additional user profile fields from your OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Configuration in xwiki.properties**:\n   You can add custom mappings in the `xwiki.properties` file. The general syntax for adding custom mappings is:\n\n   ```\n   oidc.user.mapping.<XWiki user property>=<OIDC claim>\n   ```\n\n   For example:\n\n   ```\n   oidc.user.mapping.first_name=given_name\n   oidc.user.mapping.last_name=family_name\n   oidc.user.mapping.email=email\n   oidc.user.mapping.company=organization\n   ```\n\n2. **In-wiki Configuration**:\n   If you're using the in-wiki configuration (available since XWiki 1.30+), you can add these mappings in the XWiki.OIDC.ClientConfigurationClass object. Look for properties similar to those in the xwiki.properties file and add your custom mappings there.\n\n3. **Custom Claims**:\n   If your OpenID Connect provider offers custom claims that you want to map to XWiki user properties, you can use the same syntax. For instance:\n\n   ```\n   oidc.user.mapping.customField=custom_claim_name\n   ```\n\n4. **XWiki User Profile Class**:\n   Ensure that the XWiki user profile class has the properties you want to map to. If you need to add custom fields to the user profile, you may need to extend the XWiki.XWikiUsers class.\n\n5. **Group Mapping**:\n   If you want to map groups from your OpenID Connect provider to XWiki groups, you can use the `oidc.group.mapping` property. For example:\n\n   ```\n   oidc.group.mapping=groups\n   ```\n\n   This assumes that your OpenID Connect provider returns a claim named \"groups\" with the user's group memberships.\n\n6. **Restart XWiki**:\n   After making changes to the configuration, remember to restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.\n\nRemember that the exact claims available will depend on your specific OpenID Connect provider. You may need to consult your provider's documentation to know which claims are available for mapping.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to customize the user profile fields populated from your OpenID Connect provider in XWiki, allowing for a more tailored integration between your authentication system and XWiki user profiles.",
