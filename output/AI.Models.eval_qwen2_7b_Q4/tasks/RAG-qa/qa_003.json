  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I am not receiving notifications about my own activity. How can I enable notifications for my own actions?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, one don't receive notification about one's own activity (unless the event that triggered the notification targets explicitly that user). You have the ability to disable this filter in the \"Advanced filtering options\" section of your own notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nTo receive notifications about your own activities on XWiki, you need to check and adjust your notification preferences. Here are some steps to help you with that:\n\n1. **Notifications Preferences**: Navigate to the \"Preferences\" section of your user profile in XWiki.\n\n2. **Notifications Tab**: Within the preference settings, look for a tab or option labeled \"Notifications\". This is where you can customize how you receive notifications based on different types of actions and events.\n\n3. **Enable Self-Notification Settings**: Check if there are specific options related to receiving notifications about your own actions, comments, edits, mentions, etc. You might find settings like:\n\n   - **Self-Mentions**: Ensure that this option is enabled so that you receive notifications when someone mentions you.\n   - **Self-Activity on Pages**: Make sure that the system notifies you about any activity (such as creating, editing, or publishing) on pages where you are a contributor or owner.\n\n4. **Email Notifications**: Check if there's an option to enable email notifications for self-action events. This might include setting up whether emails are sent daily with a recap of your activities during the day or based on other schedules that suit your needs.\n\n5. **Custom Filters and Rules**: If available, use custom filters to define specific rules about what kind of actions should trigger a notification in terms of frequency, type of events, etc. This might allow you more granular control over which notifications you receive.\n\n6. **Application Preferences**: Explore other XWiki applications related to notifications such as the Notifications Application or any others that are installed on your wiki instance. These can provide additional settings for receiving alerts about various activities like updates, comments, and page events.\n\n7. **Review and Confirm Settings**: After making adjustments, review all notification preference settings to ensure they match your desired configuration. Save your changes after configuring them according to your preferences.\n\n8. **Test Notifications**: Once you've set up the preferences, test by performing some actions (like editing a page or commenting on one) and check if the notifications are received as expected based on your new settings.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure XWiki to notify you about your own activities more effectively.",

Then, on the very bottom of the page, you can select the interval between 2 emails. For example, if you choose &quot;Daily&quot; (default), you will receive one email every day with the recap of the events that have happened during the day. Of course, if there were no activity in this period of time, no email is sent.\u00a0\n\nLive notifications emails can be sent to a user. The wiki administrator can also define a &quot;grace time&quot; for live email notifications ; when an event that triggers a notification is sent, the platform will wait for the duration of this grace time before sending a notification email. If during this interval, a new event of the same kind is sent, the two events will be grouped in the same email. You can get more informations on how to configure this feature [here](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HCustomizeliveemailnotificationsgracetime).\n\nOf course, it works only if the user has properly filled her e-mail address.\n\nYou can edit the frequency of your email notifications by using the selector just at the bottom of the notification preferences pane in your profile page :\n\n![notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png?rev=1.4)\n\nThe notifications are sorted by pages and dates, and a table of content summarizes all notifications contained in the email:\n\n![NotifEmailTOC.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailTOC.png?rev=1.3)\n\nA breadcrumb is displayed on top of each notification that concern a page:\n\n![NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png?rev=1.3)\n\n",
