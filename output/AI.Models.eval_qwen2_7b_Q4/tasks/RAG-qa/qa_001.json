  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nIt seems that you're experiencing an issue with the notifications system in XWiki where the bell icon in the top right corner doesn't appear, even after installing the Alert Notification extension.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. **Check if Notifications are Enabled**: Ensure that the notifications feature is enabled on your wiki. You can check this by navigating through your XWiki administration settings or looking for related configurations in the system's configuration files.\n\n2. **Review Extension Configuration**: Check the configuration of the Alert Notification extension to ensure it's set up correctly and recognized by the system. This might involve verifying that the extension has been properly installed, activated, and configured with any necessary settings.\n\n3. **Inspect System Logs**: Look into your XWiki logs for any error messages related to notifications or the Alert Notification extension. These logs can provide insights into why the bell icon isn't showing up as expected.\n\n4. **Check User Preferences**: Ensure that user preferences regarding notifications are set appropriately, as this might affect whether they see system notifications.\n\n5. **Extension Compatibility**: Verify that the Alert Notification extension is compatible with your current version of XWiki and doesn\u2019t have any known issues or conflicts with other extensions or settings on your wiki.\n\n6. **Contact Support**: If none of the above steps help, it may be worth reaching out to the XWiki community support or forums for further assistance. They might offer specific advice based on similar issues that others have encountered.\n\n7. **Check for Updates**: Sometimes, such issues can be resolved by ensuring all components (XWiki and its extensions) are updated to their latest versions. Check if there is an update available for the Alert Notification extension and install it.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue with missing notifications in your XWiki setup.",
