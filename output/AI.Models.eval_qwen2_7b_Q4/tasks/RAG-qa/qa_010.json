  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/NestedPagesMigration/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Exports \n\n\nTo achieve the configuration where one space is used by each team, allowing them to see all spaces while restricting editing rights to their own respective space, you would need to set up roles and permissions within XWiki.\n\nHere's a high-level guide on how you might accomplish this:\n\n1. **Create Teams**: First, ensure that teams are represented as separate groups or roles in your XWiki instance. You can create these by navigating to the 'Administration' section of your wiki, then selecting 'Groups'. Here, add new groups and name them according to each team.\n\n2. **Set Up Spaces**: Each space should ideally represent a specific project, task, or subject that concerns the particular team. If you have already done this, ensure that each team corresponds directly with their respective spaces.\n\n3. **Assign Roles**: For each team/group you've created:\n   - Go to the 'Spaces' section of your wiki's administration.\n   - Edit the settings for each space (e.g., Directors.WebHome).\n   - Within the space settings, add or manage roles that correspond to the teams/groups you've created.\n\n4. **Configure Roles**: For each team/group, assign specific permissions:\n   - **Viewing All Spaces**: To allow a team to view all spaces, you need to ensure they have at least 'Reader' permission in every space available for viewing.\n   - **Editing Own Space**: To restrict editing rights to their own space, ensure that within the settings of each space, only members of that specific team are granted 'Editor' or 'Admin' permissions.\n\n5. **Apply Group Memberships**: Make sure that users who belong to a team/group are added to the respective group in XWiki. You can do this by adding them when creating groups or later through the user management interface.\n\n6. **Test Permissions**: After setting up, test access and editing permissions for each team to ensure they can view all spaces but only edit their own space as intended.\n\n7. **Documentation and Training**: Consider documenting these roles and permissions clearly within your wiki or external documentation so that users can understand how the system works and what permissions mean.\n\nRemember, this process might vary slightly depending on your version of XWiki and its specific features, so always refer to the latest XWiki documentation for detailed steps and best practices.",

It means that all user-created page are called WebHome.\u00a0\n\nThen, when the user wants to create a sub-page, for example FrankCapra\u00a0inside the page Directors.WebHome, he actually creates a new space inside the space Directors with its WebHome page: Directors.FrankCapra.WebHome. That&#x27;s how we emulate it.\n\nThe notion of space has been removed from the UI. It&#x27;s not mentioned anywhere, anymore. Everything seems to work as if we were really creating sub-pages, even if under the hood, we create sub-spaces.\n\nThat emulation should be temporary. At some point we&#x27;d like to refactor the core model of XWiki and discard the concept of spaces to only keep pages. Don&#x27;t hold your breath though, this may be several years in the coming ![emoticon_wink](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_wink.png?cache-version=1711538036000)\n\nNote that users still have the ability to create pages that are not named WebHome. As a consequence, such pages (that are not the &quot;WebHome&quot; of their space) cannot have sub-pages. They&#x27;re called **Terminal Pages**.\n\n",

The process could be very long. It will use a lot of server resources, so we recommend to don&#x27;t let users access the wiki during the process. (For example, you can temporary forbid remote connections to your servlet container and access XWiki through an SSH tunnel for yourself.)\n* Since all logs are displayed in the page, even the browser can became slow. Note that we have experienced better performances using Chrome instead of Firefox.\n* Some OutOfMemory errors could happen. To avoid them, we recommend to give a lot of memory to your XWiki instance during the execution of the migration.\n* To minimize migration time, we recommend that you ensure that the Solr queue is empty before starting the migration. You can check Solr queue on the Wiki administration&gt;&gt;Solr Search Section, see [documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Solr%20Search%20Application#HSearchAdministrationSection).\n**We highly recommend to perform migration tests on a staging server before doing it on a production instance.**\n\n",

Check out the [Administration Application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application#HExport) for more information about the export tree.\n\nNaturally, this tree is not displayed if the current page is terminal, which means it cannot have children.\n\nNotes:\n\n* The &quot;XAR&quot; export format option will only appear if you are logged in with an admin user.\n* To import back a XAR file, you also need to be an admin user and use the [Import section in Administration](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/ImportExport)\n\n",
