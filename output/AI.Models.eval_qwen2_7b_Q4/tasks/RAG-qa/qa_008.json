  "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5.

  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Attachment/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Attachments \n\n\nTo restrict uploads to only include images and PDF files up to a size of 10 MB across your entire wiki, you'll need to configure two aspects: mimetypes restrictions and file size limits.\n\n### Mimetypes Restrictions\n\nYou can define which types of files are allowed based on their MIME types. For this example, let's restrict uploads to only include images (including PNGs, JPEGs, GIFs) and PDFs.\n\n**Step 1:** Edit the configuration parameters for your wiki that manage attachment restrictions.\n\n```markdown\nattachment.upload.blockList=text/plain,image/*,application/pdf\n```\n\nThis line of code tells XWiki not to allow files with MIME types `text/plain`, which are typically text documents, and anything under `image/` except images (indicated by the wildcard `*`), as well as PDF files (`application/pdf`). The `#-#` notation you see is just a comment indicating how to use this configuration.\n\n### File Size Limit\n\nYou also need to set limits on the maximum size of attachments. This can be configured globally for your wiki:\n\n**Step 2:** Set up the maximum attachment size in bytes (e.g., 10 MB).\n\n```markdown\nXWikiPreferences Maximum Upload Size=10485760 # This is equivalent to setting a limit of 10MB.\n```\n\nRemember, this step assumes you are using XWiki version 10.9RC1 or later since the maximum size was set differently in previous versions.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n\n1. **Access the Configuration**: Log into your wiki as an administrator and navigate to the configuration settings for your entire wiki (or each sub-wiki if they have separate configurations).\n\n2. **Edit XWiki Preferences**: Look for a document named `XWiki.XWikiPreferences` that allows you to edit preferences.\n\n3. **Update BlockList**: Modify the `attachment.upload.blockList` setting in the `XWiki.XWikiPreferences` document according to your needs (as shown above).\n\n4. **Set Maximum File Size**: Edit the `Maximum Upload Size` field in the same document with the new file size limit you want to set.\n\n5. **Save Your Changes**: After making these changes, save them and ensure that the wiki is restarted for the configuration changes to take effect.\n\n6. **Browser Cache Update**: If you have already attempted uploads and encountered issues due to a mismatch between your settings and previous configurations, clear your browser's cache to ensure that the new settings are applied effectively.\n\nBy following these steps, you can configure XWiki to accept only files of specific types (images and PDFs) up to 10 MB in size across all pages on your wiki.",
