  "prompt": "I'm not receiving any notifications in XWiki.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nIt seems like you're facing issues with receiving notifications in XWiki. There are several ways you can check and ensure that you're set up to receive notifications:\n\n1. **Notifications Application**: Ensure this feature is enabled on your wiki and you have access to it from the top bar under Alert entry (represented by a bell).\n\n2. **Email Preferences**: Check if your email preferences in XWiki are correctly configured to send notifications via email. You can view these settings through the Notifications Email Preferences macro.\n\n3. **Custom Filters Preferences**: If there are any custom filters you've set up, ensure they're not blocking or altering how notifications are sent.\n\n4. **Auto Watch Preferences**: Make sure that pages you're interested in are auto-watched by your account so that you receive updates whenever changes are made to these pages.\n\n5. **Mentions**: Ensure that mentions of your user name are enabled and working properly on the wiki.\n\n6. **System Notifications Filters**: You might want to check if there are any system-wide filters affecting notifications that could be causing the issue.\n\n7. **Check Extension Status**: Make sure all relevant extensions for notifications, like `Notifications Application`, `Share Page by mail`, and `Mentions Application` (for newer versions), are correctly installed and enabled on your XWiki instance.\n\n8. **Review Notifications Logs**: Some wikis log notification activity in their logs or system dashboard which might provide clues to why you're not receiving notifications.\n\n9. **Contact Support**: If none of the above helps, consider contacting your wiki administrator or seeking assistance from the XWiki community forums or support channels for further troubleshooting.\n\nIf you've recently made changes or updates on your XWiki instance and the issue started then, it might be worth checking if there were any configuration issues introduced with those changes.",
