Star quirks are transient bursts of radio waves lasting just a few seconds. They were predicted in the 1980s by astronomers who realized that if the magnetosphere - the magnetic field around the sky - is distorted sufficiently, it could accelerate electrons to near light speeds and throw them into a spiral path that would emit radio waves.\n\nBut despite this prediction, star quirks had remained elusive until now. \"It's very exciting because, for the first time, we've actually imaged one of these events,\" said astrophysicist Daniel Thorington of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), lead author of a study published in Nature earlier this year describing the discovery. \n\nThe UCSC astronomers were conducting observations using the Breakthough Listen, a powerful digital system installed on the 305-meter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, when they serendipitously picked up a star quiz burst. The extremely sensitive antenna was scanning the sky above the plane of our galaxy when it detected a brief spike in radio waves from a region near the constellation Scorpio. \n\n\"We're like kids in a candy shop with this new instrument,\" said astrophysicist Gerard Gilmore, UCSC professor and co-author of the study.\" We're seeing all kinds of exciting things and this is one of the most unusual.\" \n\nThe burst lasted about three seconds, emitting highly polarized radio waves \u2014 alpha particles spiraling in the same direction \u2014 coming from a faint dwarf galaxy more than 3 billion light years away. The emission was bright and distinctive, making it obvious that this unusual event warranted further attention, Thorington said.\n\n\"We're very lucky to have seen this thing because it's quite possible it won't happen again for several months or even years,\" he added. \"It's really a needle in the cosmos.\" \n\nFollow-up observations revealed that the burst came from a galaxy with an extremely low level of hydrogen, suggesting it was a small galaxy devoid of the hydrogen clouds usually found around galaxies. This ruled out some other explanations for the burst, confirming it as a star quiz. Gilmore said the discovery has already proved valuable in another way: It shows that astronomers can use polarized radio waves to locate the distant homes of these bursts and study the magnetic fields surrounding their sources. \n\nThat's important because magnetic fields are elusive; although they dominate the cosmos and play an essential role in many cosmic phenomena, including particle acceleration and gamma-ray bursts, we don't know how they form in many situations, he said. Thorington added that it's also exciting for astronomers to finally observe a phenomenon predicted decades ago.\" It gives us confidence that the theoretical understanding of this bizarre astrophysics is on the right track,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers now hope to build on this discovery by continuing to scan the skies with the Green Bank Telescope in the hopes of locating more star quizzes, which could reveal more about their origins and the mysterious magnetospheres around celestial bodies. \"It's a whole new way of studying the magnetism of galaxies,\" Gilmore said.",
