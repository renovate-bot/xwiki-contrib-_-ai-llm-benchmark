And occasionally, they make a surprising discovery that sheds light on both past and present mysteries.\n\nThat's exactly what happened when an international team of researchers recently found a way to extract DNA from 43 million-year-old amber. The DNA analysis revealed the insect trapped inside the fossilized tree resin was an entirely new species\u2014and it seemed to bridge an important gap in our understanding of ant evolution.\n\nThe amblyops arkanus, as the new species has been named, provides a crucial link between primitive blind ants that lived millions of years ago and the diverse range of ants seen today. The discovery, published recently in Nature Communications, offers a rare glimpse into an ancient branch of insect evolution, helping to explain how ants went from simple creatures that lived on flies and wood-boring beetles to the complex societies we see today.\n\n\"This find is like discovering a missing fossil link,\" said Dr. George Poinar Jr., a professor emeritus of entomology at Oregon State University and one of the authors of the study, in a press release. \"It helps fill in details of the origin and early evolution of the agricultural and eusocial behavior seen in modern ants.\"\n\nEusociality is a fancy way of describing the highly organized social structures of modern ants, where you have fertile queens, sterile workers, soldiers, and others all working together to survive. It's a unique phenomenon in the animal kingdom, and one that has helped ants take over much of the planet. But as anyone who has ever had an ant infestation knows, these tiny creatures are hard to study since they're so diverse and difficult to catch in the act of behaving.\n\nThe recently discovered amber-encased ant doesn't resemble modern forms\u2014it's small (only 3 millimeters long), has large eyes, and appears to have lived a solitary life. But its DNA suggests it was closely related to living ants, particularly those with eusocial behaviors. This is exciting because it shows scientists what an ancestral ant might have looked like and how it behaved.\n\nPoinar and his colleagues made the discovery while on an expedition through France's Oise department, searching for amber left behind by an ancient forest that once flourished near the Arctic Circle some 43 million years ago. It was a painstaking process, but they ended up finding six specimens trapped in amber, which they could see had large compound eyes and delicate antennae. \n\nThe scientists knew they'd found something special, and extracted the DNA to learn more about these mysterious creatures. Comparison with the DNA of other ant species alive today showed the amblyops arkanus to be a very primitive form\u2014an early member of a major branch of ants that includes forms with wings, stingers, and many modern traits. \n\nThe study also suggested that this new ant species shared an ancestor with those living ants about 129 million years ago. That's significant because it lines up with theories about the timing of when ants first began to diversify, which was likely driven by their association with flowering plants. \n\nWhile this discovery helps fill in some of the blanks regarding ant evolution, there's still a lot we don't know. Fortunately, this find shows that ancient amber can yield valuable genetic material and shed light on the origins of major insect groups. \n\n\"It's exciting to think about what other genetic treasures might be hidden in ancient ambers, waiting to be discovered,\" Poinar said.",
