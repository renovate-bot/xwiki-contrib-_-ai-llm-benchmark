  "ai_answer": "A team of international researchers, including scientists from the University of Sydney's School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, have developed a revolutionary material that can be used to print complex 3D objects which dramatically change shape in response to external stimuli such as heat or light.\n\nThe breakthrough, published today in Nature Materials, opens up a new frontier in the emerging field of metamorphic materials science, which enables designers and engineers to create innovative structures that can morph their shape and potentially assemble themselves.\n\nThe research reveals a new way to control matter so it can be designed to exhibit a specific behaviour or respond in a certain way \u2013 an important step towards creating truly shape-shifting materials for real-world applications.\n\n\"We demonstrate how different materials can be integrated into a single platform that displays triggered, reversible changes in shape and also show how multiple stimuli-responsive functions can be combined within one material structure,\" said lead author Dr. Sebastian Demmel from the University of Sydney.\n\nThe researchers created a material that can be activated to change its shape when exposed to heat, and then return to its original shape when cooled, all while being flexible enough to accommodate complex designs. \n\n\"Our technique involves printing an intricate lattice structure with different materials arranged in specific areas which have varying responses to heat,\" said Dr. Demmel. \n\nWhen heated above 60 degrees Celsius the material expands unevenly causing the printed part to deform and twist in a complex way. The design and material arrangement dictates the shape change, which can be tuned by the researchers.\n\n\"We're essentially giving the material a form of artificial muscle so it can reconfigure itself. It's like having multiple joints that can contract or expand in response to heat,\" said Dr. Demmel.\n\nThe team fabricated a 3D-printed armature which changes shape when heated, forming a intricate three-dimensional sculpture of a latched bird cage. When heated the cage unfurls and opens up, and cools down to touch returning to its original printed state. The piece morphs from a simple compact shape into a complex 3D structure with a stroke of heat.\n\n\"This level of complexity has not been shown before in self-morphing materials,\" said Dr Demmel. \n\nThe researchers say the material platform could be adapted for multiple applications including reconfigurable architecture, deployable structures for space missions, or even in health care as reversible stents or implants.\n\n\"There's also potential for the material to respond to stimuli other than heat, such as light, which we are exploring now,\" said Dr. Demmel. \n\nThe development of metamorphic materials has been largely theoretical until now, but this research proves the concept with real-world applications in sight.\n\n\"We're opening up a new field of design where engineers can create functional moving structures simply and directly manipulating the response of materials to their environment,\" said Dr Demmel.",
