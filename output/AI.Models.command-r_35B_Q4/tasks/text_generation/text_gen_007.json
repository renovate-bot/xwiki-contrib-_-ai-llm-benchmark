They have identified a new species of crocodile, which they have named the 'Ngomensis Crocodile'. This new species is believed to be a crucial piece in understanding the evolution of some of the largest crocodiles that ever lived.\n\nThe Ngomensis Crocodile is estimated to be around 6 million years old and belongs to a group of ancient crocodiles known as the machairodonts, which translates to 'knife-teeth'. This species is characterized by its massive, serrated teeth that resemble the sabers seen in saber-toothed cats.\n\nDr. John Bales, a paleontologist who led the research team, said that the discovery of the Ngomensis Crocodile helps fill in a gap in the evolutionary record. \"We knew that large machairodont crocodiles must have been present in Africa during the Miocene era, as their giant relatives have been found elsewhere in the world. It was quite thrilling to uncover the first direct evidence of these massive reptiles.\"\n\nThe discovery came about serendetically while Dr. Bales and his team were examining fossil teeth and bones unearthed by local villagers in Senegal. Among the assortment of fossils was a remarkable collection of crocodile teeth with distinctive serrated edges. Further excavation at the site yielded more crocodilian fossils, including a nearly complete skull. \n\nComparison with other known extinct species and thorough anatomical analysis using CT scans revealed distinct features of this new species, confirming their suspicions. The Ngomensis Crocodile had a long, slender snout packed with incredibly large teeth, indicating a specialist hunter capable of taking down large prey.\n\nThe discovery sheds new light on the evolution of crocodiles and their incredible adaptability over millions of years. According to Dr. Bales, \"This find contributes greatly to our understanding of the biodiversity of African crocodiles during the Miocene and provides a crucial glimpse into the origins of some of the most fearsome predators that have ever roamed the Earth.\" \n\nThe study has been published in the latest edition of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.",
