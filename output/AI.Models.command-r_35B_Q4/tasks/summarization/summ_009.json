  "prompt": "Please summarize the following text:\n\n\n[A wiki is a website that you can edit online easily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki).\u00a0\n\nWhenever you want to modify a page, click on the \"edit\" button, make your changes and save the page. The modified page now replaces the previous version. This makes it easy to update the website and have people contribute content. Each version of the page is stored in the page history and can be reverted to if needed.\n\nOn top of this basic feature set, most wikis include additional features such as access rights management and notifications.\n\nThe core advantages of a wiki compared with traditional Content Management Systems and ECM lie in its flexibility and the ease with which new pages can be added and linked to.\n\nThanks to their flexibility and ease of use, wikis can be used to address a wide range of situations:\n\n* Share information about a given topic (knowledge base, product catalog, documentation)\n* Manage a project (organize an event, create a product, setup a new tool)\n* Communicate with other people (as a website, an intranet or an extranet)\n* And much more!\n\nBasically, a wiki can be used whenever you want to use a flexible platform to centralize information and share it with other people. It comes as a handy replacement to email when many-to-many communication takes place and information needs to be made available to every participant in one place.

The key advantage of wikis over other content management systems lies in their flexibility and simplicity, making them ideal for sharing information. Anyone can modify pages, and each version is stored in the page's history. Wikis are versatile and can be used in various scenarios, such as knowledge sharing, project management and communication. They are particularly useful when multiple people need to access and contribute to a central platform.
