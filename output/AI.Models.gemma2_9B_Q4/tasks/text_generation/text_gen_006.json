  "ai_answer": "Sunrise paints the mountain peaks,\nA fiery blush, the world awakes.\nEmerald valleys, dew-kissed green,\nWhere wildflowers bloom, a vibrant scene.\n\nA symphony of birdsong fills the air,\nA gentle breeze, a whispered prayer.\nSunlight dances on a crystal stream,\nReflecting clouds, a fleeting dream.\n\nAncient trees, with roots so deep,\nTheir branches reach, towards secrets they keep.\nA canvas vast, of blue and gold,\nA story told, a beauty untold.\n\nThe moonbeams bathe the sleeping land,\nIn silver light, a mystic hand.\nStars ignite, a twinkling sea,\nA cosmic dance, for you and me.\n\nSo let us pause, and take it in,\nThis wondrous world, where life begins.\nFor in its grace, and boundless might,\nWe find our solace, day and night. \n\n\n",
