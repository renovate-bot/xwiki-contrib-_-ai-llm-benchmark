  "ai_answer": "The sunbeams dance on emerald leaves,\nA symphony of light, the forest breathes.\nA gentle breeze through branches weaves,\nA rustling song, the earth believes.\n\nA crystal brook, a silver thread,\nFlows through the meadows, softly led\nBy wildflowers bright, in hues spread,\nA vibrant tapestry, where dreams are fed.\n\nThe mountains rise, a silent stand,\nGuarding secrets, made by hand\nOf time and stone, across the land,\nA timeless beauty, so grand.\n\nThe ocean roars, a mighty sound,\nCrashing waves upon the sandy ground.\nShells scattered, treasures found,\nIn beauty wild, without a bound.\n\nFrom towering pines to petals small,\nNature's art enthralls us all.\nA wondrous world, for one and all,\nA beauty vast, that conquers all. \n\n\n",
