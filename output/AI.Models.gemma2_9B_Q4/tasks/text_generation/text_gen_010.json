  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "The human brain is a highly complex neural network responsible for orchestrating physiological processes, sensory perception, cognitive functions, and behavioral responses.  As the central processing unit of the body, it integrates and interprets afferent stimuli, generating efferent signals that regulate motor output and modulate homeostasis. \n\n\nWhile the subjective experiences of consciousness, cognition, and emotion are integral to the human condition, their neurological underpinnings remain an active area of scientific inquiry.\n",
