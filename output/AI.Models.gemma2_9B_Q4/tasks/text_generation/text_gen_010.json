  "prompt": "Adapt the following text to a more technical audience:\n\nThe human brain is a complex organ that controls all functions of the body, interprets information from the outside world, and embodies the essence of the mind and soul.",
  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "The human brain is a highly complex biological network responsible for orchestrating physiological processes, sensory perception, information processing, and the expression of cognition and consciousness. \n\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n* **\"Complex organ\"** is replaced with **\"highly complex biological network\"** to emphasize the intricate interconnectedness of its neural structures.\n* **\"Controls all functions of the body\"** is rephrased as **\"orchestrating physiological processes\"** for a more concise and technical tone.\n* **\"Interprets information from the outside world\"** is made more specific as **\"sensory perception\"** and **\"information processing\"**.\n* Instead of \"embodies the essence of the mind and soul,\" we use **\"expression of cognition and consciousness\"** to reflect a more scientific approach, acknowledging the complex neural basis of these phenomena. \n\n\nThe revised text avoids overly poetic language and focuses on conveying the brain's functions in a precise and technical manner.",
