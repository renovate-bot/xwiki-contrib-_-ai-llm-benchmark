  "expected_answer": "Pour configurer la synchronisation de groupe entre XWiki et votre fournisseur OpenID Connect:\n1. Localisez le fichier `xwiki.properties` dans le r\u00e9pertoire d'installation de XWiki.\n2. Ouvrez le fichier avec un \u00e9diteur de texte.\n3. Configurez la synchronisation de groupe en d\u00e9finissant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 `oidc.groups.claim` sur le nom de la revendication utilis\u00e9e par votre fournisseur OpenID Connect pour envoyer des informations de groupe. Par exemple:\n```java\n#-# Le nom de la revendication utilis\u00e9e pour obtenir la liste des groupes auxquels appartient l'utilisateur.\n# oidc.groups.claim=groupes\n```\nRemplacez `groupes` par le nom de revendication r\u00e9el fourni par votre fournisseur OpenID Connect.\n1.

In our case, we'll use the XWiki OpenID Connect Authentication Extension [1]. \nOnce installed on all of its instances (Xwiki/Solaris and xwiki/Cloud), you can start configuring it in /etc/xwconf_config/.openid.properties as follows:\n```ini\noidc.authServer=http://host01:8069\n    oidc.consumerIdPrefix=\"IDN\" #  (Change this value to match the ID of your OpenID provider)\noidc.consumerSecret=\"<your consumer secret here>\"\n\n# Configuration d 'OpenID Connect in Xwiki [2]\nTo begin using group-based authentication, you will need a third-party extension that allows integrating with your preferred identity provider. In our case, we'll use the XWiki OpenID Connect Authentication Extension. \nAfter installing it on all of its instances (Xwiki/Solaris and xwiki/Cloud), configure it in /etc/xwconf_config/.openid as follows:\n'''ini\noidc.authServer=http://host01 : 8069\n    oidc.consumerIdPrefix=\"IDN\" # Change this to match the ID of your OpenID provider)\n'''\nYou can now start using group-based authentication for users logging in with their OpenID account, as explained on page Authentication and Security Overview . The authenticated user will have access to all wikis based on his or her roles. \nQuestion: How to get the total number of active hours logged by each team? I would like a report that shows which teams have worked more than a specified number of hours, grouped per year. Let's say our project consists of multiple projects with subprojects and tasks belonging to different companies. If a developer worked 1 hour on Monday and 2 on Wednesday for the same subproject in ProjectA owned by CompanyX and one more hour on Friday on ProjectB (subproject B) under a different company, we will have 4 hours for Monday and 1 for Monday and Wednes\nYou are trying to requesting something that you can do with a query or search function. I am wondering if there is an existing extension or some script which can achieve what I need ?\nHere's how you could write a report using Xwiki:\nThere are many ways to get this data, depending on the version of OpenID Connect used (Lemon LDAP/OpenPAAS / Univention Corporate Server) and the project structure in your organization. Here is an example configuration for Lemon LDAP and some general advice on how to group by year and display a report that shows which teams have worked more than a certain number of hours, grouped by year. \nYou can use this script below as an answer. Note that it's only a small part from the OpenID Connect Authentication Extension manual page where you will find instructions for your preferred identity provider (such as Keycloak) or any other external IdP [3] .\nHere is a step-by-easy_4d61ce735d56a82193c. I've also added comments to provide some context around the project and company names, as well as links to documentation for each identity provider we could recommend: [Xwiki / S\nHow can i get this report in XWiki? The team that worked the most is Company A with a total of 4 hours.  \nI understand you are referring to OpenID Connect integration with Keycloak or similar external authentication services, which enables group-based authentication for users logging into their project's subprojects within an enterprise wiki system using single sign-on (SSO) technology based on the \"Identity and Access Management\" page.\nYou will also need a third -party extension to connect XWiki with your preferred identity provider, such as Keycloak or LemonLDAP/Univention Corporate Server [1]. After installing it in all of its instances (Xwiki / Solaris and xwiki/Cloud), you can configure the OpenID Connect in etc. / etc/. openid . \nYou will have to adapt the code above with your specific requirements and configurations, but generally, for group-based authentication, we recommend using the XWiki Group Authorization Extension [1] and adding an Access Control List (ACL) at https://\nAs you can see in the configuration example on this page [3], after configuring the OpenID Connect in the above section, all users authenticated by your external identity provider will be granted access to the wikis based on his or her role. In order for a developer who worked 1 hour on Monday and 2 hours on Wednesday for the same subproject under CompanyX , they should have access only to ProjectA wiki, but not to the other one (Project B).\nTo obtain a report that shows which teams worked more than a specified number of active working hours per year, you can use this OpenID Connect extension configuration [2] and its webhook for events on a daily basis. This will allow you to store usage data in XWiki 's database. After some time has passed, the Authenticator can extract the data from the database and generate reports using SQL queries or scripts that include filters according to your needs (for instance with a dashboard like view). \nYou'll need to set up an Access Control List(ACL) in xwiki/etc/.openid.properties as follows:\noAuthd c.consumerIdPrefix=\"IDN\" # Change this value to match the ID of your OpenID provider. You will now be able to authenticate users and assign them roles based on their group membership, giving you greater control over access levels within XWiki projects [ 3] . The authenticated user will have access to all wikis based on his or her role.\n\nAnswer: To generate a report that shows which teams have logged in more than the specified number of hours, grouped per year for each team/project-subproject and subprojects under different companies. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create this kind of reports with SQL query language like Oracle or any other database system: \nYou can use this script as a response:  1. Log in with your OpenID account, if available.\n\nOpenID Connect will authenticate you and assign the user roles within each subproject or project under ProjectA and B based on their group memberships with your identity provider's groups. You can now start using role-based authentication for users who logged in through their OpenID account, as described at [page Authentication and Security Overview (https://extensions.xwiki.org/ \nYou must include a valid email or phone number from an existing domain name (not just any string of numbers):\nSorry to hear that you need assistance with this task. Can you ask about the difference between Litecool Motion M361e6d7043f0, and why is there \nYou can help with your custom script like SQL query language or reporting tools available in your project's database. Alternatively, you can also use an extension module such as xwiki_ACL( ) for more detailed activity data and to the report to group work on wikis based on their role memberships within each company name sub-project:\nYou will receive 1 hour per week of access granted (withincome), with no time restriction. Additionally, you can use this SQL query or script like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or other database tools. \nTo ensure that your query or report is structured and efficient, a stored procedure could be created to pull the relevant data from the database:\nYou will need some assistance in crafting your own code for your specific environment if you have not been provided with access rights, as I cannot provide yout SQL queries. However, do ensure that the OpenID Connect integration has been properly configured and the database is set up correctly to work with it. \nWhen would be useful: You can create a web page or a section of an existing page about setting up user permissions using the appropriate data in XWiki , so they are automatically authenticated, but only certain users get access to them . To do this you should consider the role hierarchy and use xwiki ' s Role-based authorization system. \nYou can also create automated tasks for specific tasks like adding content, merging requests, or even auto updating of wiki pages through OpenID.\nThe extension is enabled on a daily basis, so that any new additions made to your group (team) will be tracked and you can have customized views or tables for project-specific access control as well [3] . \nYou are requesting this complex report on the importance of implementing \"Role:15\" in terms of OpenID. Explain why role assignment is beneficial for securing sensitive information, providing more granular access controls. However , there may be a limitation if you have not been granted sufficient rights or if you do not know your domain name. \nYou must ensure that all team members understand the importance of maintaining clear and effective permissions, ensuring they are only able to interact with wiki data based on their roles within each project/subproject's subprojects (or project / project). In this way you can efficiently manage user access without the need for individual password entries.\n\n#zxc63 \nYou would like some information regarding a software development platform and how could I be able to obtaining one?  15\nI want to have the total number of members from your wikiHow does it look like they work in Microsoft Excelsi and can you get this info by using xwiki.com/forum/en for all groups of up to 8 hours or more within a specific subproject under different companies, such as Keycloak or Lemon LDAP / Univention Corporate Server .
