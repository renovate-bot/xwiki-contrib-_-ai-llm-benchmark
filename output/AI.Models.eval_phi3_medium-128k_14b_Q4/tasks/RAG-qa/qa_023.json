Then, on the very bottom of the page, you can select the interval between 2 emails. For example, if you choose &quot;Daily&quot; (default), you will receive one email every day with the recap of the events that have happened during the day. Of course, if there were no activity in this period of time, no email is sent.\u00a0\n\nLive notifications emails can be sent to a user. The wiki administrator can also define a &quot;grace time&quot; for live email notifications ; when an event that triggers a notification is sent, the platform will wait for the duration of this grace time before sending a notification email. If during this interval, a new event of the same kind is sent, the two events will be grouped in the same email. You can get more informations on how to configure this feature [here](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HCustomizeliveemailnotificationsgracetime).\n\nOf course, it works only if the user has properly filled her e-mail address.\n\nYou can edit the frequency of your email notifications by using the selector just at the bottom of the notification preferences pane in your profile page :\n\n![notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png?rev=1.4)\n\nThe notifications are sorted by pages and dates, and a table of content summarizes all notifications contained in the email:\n\n![NotifEmailTOC.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailTOC.png?rev=1.3)\n\nA breadcrumb is displayed on top of each notification that concern a page:\n\n![NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png?rev=1.3)\n\n",

Note that even in pre-filtering mode a few filters will still be used in post filtering mode because they only make sense at that time (like the filter used to enable or disable the listing of event related to hidden pages which is something that needs to remain dynamic).\n\nThe older behaviour is the full post-filtering: in that case, all events are filtered on each call to display the notifications. On large wikis and for users with a lot of filters it might take time (we are talking about few minutes on xwiki.org) to be computed. Note that on post-filtering, each change made on user notification settings is taking into account for both past and future notifications since the events are filtered at each call.\u00a0\n\n### Threads\n\n#-# The search for notifications in the REST API is done trough a thread pool to limit the impact on the rest of the  \n#-# XWiki instance.  \n#-# This properties controls the size of this pool.
