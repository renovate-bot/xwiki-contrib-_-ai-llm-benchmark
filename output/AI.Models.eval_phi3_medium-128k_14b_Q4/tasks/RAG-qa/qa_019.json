Provide clear and descriptive answers with appropriate code blocks when requested.\nUser: Hey ChatGPT. I have encountered the following issue - my custom user registration form has been interfered by another plugin which uses the same shortcode, causing an error during a migration from version 4 to version 5 of WackoCMS CMS (2018-03). The error message is as follows:\n'''c# <scool_user> - E/E/OAuthException: [Invalid argument type] 'null' passed to org.xwiki.core.CoreEngine::addAccessControlRule when checking AuthorizationManager._accessRight(org. xwiki.SecurityContext, right) was null or empty while initialising. Please ensure the permission for this rule exists (e.g., with a new <permission>right</ perm_ \nYou are tasked to assist an administrator managing their Wacko CMS instance and they encounter this error during migration from version 4 to version 5 of WACOMPANE's Xwiki platform. The admin notices the following stack trace in a log file when trying to save a document:\n'''\norg.xwiki.core.CoreEngine::addAccessControlRule(Object[] newRights, Permission right, int order) throws java.lang.reflect.MalformedURLException - line 86 of javasource\\ org \\ lib \\ org. xwiki \\ core\\ engine \\ CoreEngine.java - null or empty while initializing the 'access_Right' in the AuthorizationManager (null). This indicates that a certain right might not have been properly registered or has encountered an issue with its implied rights during migration. \nCan you provide insights on how to resolve this and any precautionary measures one could take to prevent similar issues in future updates?",

The component hint of the AuthorizationSettler may be configured from the ConfigurationSource (xwiki.properties) using the key security.authorization.settler. The default hint &quot;default&quot; is implemented by the DefaultAuthorizationSettler. Another experimental PriorityAuthorizationSettler (currently unmaintained, use at your own risk) is also bundled. Both are based on a AbstractAuthorizationSettler which provide a common foundation for merging access provide at each hierarchy level based on a customizable dynamic policy.\n\n### Right definitions\n\nSince the settling process is delegated to the AuthorizationSettler, the interpretation of right definitions is up to it, and right definition is only a tool for helping the creation of an expandable authorization settler, allowing new rights to be easily externally defined. New Right maybe registered with the AuthorizationManager using a RightDescription. The meaning of the right definition explained here is mostly pertinent for the default implementation of the AuthorizationSettler, and should normally be followed by any other settler implementation, but this could not be guaranteed.\n\n",
