  "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5. Repeat for each (sub)wiki for which you need to set this configuration!",

Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Set the Maximum Upload Size\n\n1. **Navigate to XWiki Preferences:**\n   - Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`.\n\n2. **Edit XWikiPreferences Object:**\n   - Click on the line that says `XWikiPreferences 0` (right below the line that says `Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1)`).\n\n3. **Set Maximum Upload Size:**\n   - Scroll down to the field that says `Maximum Upload Size` and change the number to `10485760` bytes (which is 10MB).\n\n4. **Save Changes:**\n   - Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\".\n\n### Step 2: Restrict Allowed MIME Types\n\n1. **Access the Administration UI:**\n   - Go to the administration section of your wiki.\n\n2. **Navigate to Attachment Restrictions:**\n   - Find the `Attachments Restriction` section in the administration UI.\n\n3. **Set Allowed MIME Types:**\n   - Define the list of allowed MIME types. Since you want to allow only images and PDFs, you can set the allowed MIME types to:\n     ```\n     image/*,application/pdf\n     ```\n\n4. **Save Changes:**\n   - Save the configuration.\n\n### Example Configuration in `xwiki.properties`\n\nAlternatively, you can configure these settings directly in the `xwiki.properties` file:\n\n1. **Set Maximum Upload Size:**\n   ```properties\n   attachment.upload.maxSize=10485760\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Allowed MIME Types:**\n   ```properties\n   attachment.upload.allowedList=image/*,application/pdf\n   ```\n\n### Summary\n\nBy following these steps, you will restrict uploads to only image and PDF files with a maximum size of 10MB across your entire XWiki instance. This ensures that users can only upload files that meet these criteria.",

      "content": "## Filesystem Attachment Store\n\nThe default since 10.5\n\nThe Filesystem attachment store saves your attachments in files in a directory tree. This means you will have one more thing to do when you back up your data but it also means you can save larger (over one gigabyte) files. Filesystem attachment store implements a two stage commit mechanism to maintain integrity even if the database fails to commit the attachment meta-data.\n\n### Filesystem attachment store location\n\nBy default the filsystem storage is located in a sub-folder (store/file since XWiki 11.0 and storage before) of the permanent directory (defined with the parameter environment.permanentDirectory in the xwiki.properties file). By default it&#x27;s defined to be data, which is a directory relative to where the Java Servlet Container was started. It&#x27;s recommend to modify this value to be absolute sure that you can start the Servlet Container from any directory and still have XWiki find the attachments located in this work directory.\n\nFor example:\n\nenvironment.permanentDirectory=/opt/tomcat6/dataSince 11.4 it&#x27;s possible to set the location of the filesystem store without modifying the general permanent directory using property store.file.directory of the file xwiki.properties.\n\nstore.file.directory=/my/custom/location### Other considerations\n\nIf you are running a [cluster](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Clustering/) you will need \u00a0to have a synchronized storage directory for each node. You can use NFS or other means to mount the disk on each node in the cluster.\n\n",
