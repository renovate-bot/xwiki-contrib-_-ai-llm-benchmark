  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIf you're not receiving any notifications in XWiki, there are several potential reasons and solutions to consider:\n\n1. **Check Notification Settings**:\n   - Ensure that notifications are enabled on the platform. The configuration variable `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` should be set to `true`.\n   - Verify that email notifications are enabled by checking the `notifications.emails.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`.\n\n2. **Email Configuration**:\n   - Make sure that your email address is correctly filled in your user profile.\n   - Check the interval setting for email notifications in your notification preferences pane. By default, it is set to \"Daily,\" but you can change it according to your needs.\n\n3. **Grace Time for Live Email Notifications**:\n   - If live email notifications are enabled, ensure that the grace time is properly configured. The variable `notifications.emails.live.graceTime` in `xwiki.properties` defines how long the platform waits before sending a notification email after an event is triggered.\n\n4. **Filters**:\n   - Ensure that you haven't accidentally filtered out notifications. XWiki allows you to filter notifications for your own events, minor events, and more. Check the Filters section in your notification settings.\n\n5. **Server Restart**:\n   - After making changes to the `xwiki.properties` file, remember to restart the server for the changes to take effect.\n\n6. **Scalability Issues**:\n   - If you suspect scalability issues, it might be worth contacting XWiki support for assistance. Disabling email notifications temporarily could help diagnose the problem.\n\nHere is an example of how the settings might look in `xwiki.properties`:\n\n```properties\n# Enable notifications\nnotifications.enabled = true\n\n# Enable email notifications\nnotifications.emails.enabled = true\n\n# Set grace time for live email notifications (in minutes)\nnotifications.emails.live.graceTime = 10\n```\n\nIf you've checked all these settings and are still not receiving notifications, it might be helpful to look at the server logs for any errors or warnings related to the notification system.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Notifications Application documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/).\n\nIf you need further assistance, please provide more details about your setup and any error messages you might be seeing.",

In order to reduce the load on the server and on your MTA, you can define a live notification grace time in xwiki.properties with the variable notifications.emails.live.graceTime. The server should be restarted for the changes to take effect.\n\n#-# [Since 9.6RC1]  \n#-# Indicate the grace time used when sending live email notifications.  \n#-# When an event is triggered in the wiki (for example, a document update), the platform will wait X minutes  \n#-# before sending live notifications emails.
