  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "Here's a more technical adaptation of the text:\n\nThe human brain is a sophisticated neurological organ that serves as the central processing unit for the body's physiological functions, cognitive processes, and homeostatic regulation. It integrates and analyzes sensory inputs from external stimuli, facilitates higher-order thinking, and is considered the biological substrate for consciousness and cognitive functions. The brain's intricate network of approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of synaptic connections form the neuroanatomical basis for information processing, memory formation, and executive functions, while also coordinating the autonomic nervous system and endocrine responses.",
