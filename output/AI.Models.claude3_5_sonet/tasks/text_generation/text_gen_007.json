Once bound, engineered enzymes begin breaking down the plastic into harmless organic compounds. The magnetic particles can then be collected using electromagnetic fields, leaving clean water behind.\n\nInitial testing in laboratory conditions has shown promising results, though researchers caution that scaling up the technology for real-world application will require additional research and development.\n\n\"We're optimistic about the potential impact of this technology,\" says marine biologist Dr. James Martinez, who wasn't involved in the study. \"However, we need to ensure it's safe for marine ecosystems before implementing it on a larger scale.\"\n\nThe research team plans to begin small-scale ocean trials within the next year, pending environmental approval.\n\n[Note: This is a fictional news article created for demonstration purposes.]",
