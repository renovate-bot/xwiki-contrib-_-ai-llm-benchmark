  "prompt": "How can I deny script right to a space administrator?",
  "expected_answer": "This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/Permission%20types/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module \n\n\nBased on the information provided, I'm afraid it's not possible to deny the script right to a space administrator. Here's why:\n\n1. The ADMIN right, which is granted to space administrators, automatically includes several other rights, including the SCRIPT right. As stated in the information:\n\n   ```\n   ADMIN | admin | DENY | ALLOW | not deniable | LOGIN, VIEW, EDIT, DELETE, REGISTER, COMMENT, SCRIPT | Wiki, Space | may be allowed | Admin user with all basic rights\n   ```\n\n2. The ADMIN right is marked as \"not deniable\", which means that once it's granted, you cannot selectively remove individual rights that are included within it.\n\n3. The SCRIPT right is one of the implied rights for the ADMIN right, so it cannot be separated from the admin privileges.\n\nGiven these constraints, if you want to deny the script right to a user, you would need to remove their space administrator status entirely. This would also remove all other admin privileges for that user in the space.\n\nIf fine-grained control over script execution is crucial for your use case, you might need to consider alternative approaches, such as:\n\n1. Implementing custom authorization logic at the script execution level.\n2. Creating a new role with all admin rights except for script execution, but this would require modifications to the XWiki platform itself.\n\nIt's important to note that the inability to deny specific rights to administrators is a security feature designed to maintain the integrity of the admin role and prevent potential privilege escalation issues.",

      "content": "Therefore, the real task of settling access decisions is entirely delegated to customizable components that may be introduce by third parties and configured without rebuilding the platform. The component hint of the AuthorizationSettler may be configured from the ConfigurationSource (xwiki.properties) using the key security.authorization.settler. The default hint &quot;default&quot; is implemented by the DefaultAuthorizationSettler. Another experimental PriorityAuthorizationSettler (currently unmaintained, use at your own risk) is also bundled. Both are based on a AbstractAuthorizationSettler which provide a common foundation for merging access provide at each hierarchy level based on a customizable dynamic policy.\n\n### Right definitions\n\nSince the settling process is delegated to the AuthorizationSettler, the interpretation of right definitions is up to it, and right definition is only a tool for helping the creation of an expandable authorization settler, allowing new rights to be easily externally defined. New Right maybe registered with the AuthorizationManager using a RightDescription. The meaning of the right definition explained here is mostly pertinent for the default implementation of the AuthorizationSettler, and should normally be followed by any other settler implementation, but this could not be guaranteed.\n\n",
