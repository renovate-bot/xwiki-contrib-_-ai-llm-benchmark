  "prompt": "Can I customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki?\nI want to map additional user profile fields from my OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. How can I achieve this?",
  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider by mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nTo map additional user profile fields, use the `oidc.user.mapping` property. Here's an example of how to map custom properties:\n\n```\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}\n```\n\nReplace `myxproperty1` and `myxproperty2` with the actual XWiki user property names, and `${oidc.user.subject}` with the appropriate variable based on the data provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n\nAfter configuring the mappings, save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart XWiki to apply the changes.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \n\n\nYes, you can customize and extend the functionality of your XWiki instance by mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to specific XWiki user properties using a combination of OIDC configuration settings in `xwiki.properties` file along with some Java code modifications if necessary. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Configure the OIDC Provider Settings: \n   - Open or create an XML file named \"oidc-provider\" under your XWiki installation directory (e.g., `xwiki/conf/oidc-provider`). This is where we will define our custom mappings and properties for each provider type supported by the OIDC plugin in XWiki, which includes Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.\n   - Add a new entry to this XML file with your OpenID Connect Provider details (e.g., `providerId`, `clientId`, `redirectUri`). You can find these values on the developer console of your chosen provider or in their documentation if available. \n   \n2. Define Custom Mappings: In the same \"oidc-provider\" XML file, add a new entry for each additional user profile field you want to map from your OpenID Connect Provider (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`). Here's an example of how this can be done using Google as our OIDC provider:\n```xml\n<oidc-provider id=\"google\" clientId=\"${client_id}\" redirectUri=\"${redirect_uri}\">\n    <property name=\"user.name\" value=\"@account_email@gmail.com\"/> <!-- Default user property -->\n    <mapping>\n        <from field=\"givenName\"/> <!-- Google's first name profile field -->\n        <to xwiki:type=\"xwiki/UserPropertyValue\">firstName</to>\n    </mapping>\n    <mapping>\n        <from field=\"familyName\"/> <!-- Google's last name profile field -->\n        <to xwiki:type=\"xwiki/UserPropertyValue\">lastName</to>\n    </mapping>\n</oidc-provider>\n```\nIn this example, we are mapping the `givenName` and `familyName` fields from Google to XWiki user properties named \"firstName\" and \"lastName\", respectively. You can add as many mappings as you need for your specific use case by following a similar structure in XML format within each provider entry under `<oidc-provider>`.\n   \n3. Update `xwiki.properties` File: In the XWiki installation directory, locate and open or create an empty file named \"xwiki.properties\". Add custom properties for your additional user profile fields using this syntax (e.g., `\"firstName\"=\"\"`): \n```properties\nuser.name=@account_email@gmail.com\nfirstName=\"\"\nlastName=\"\"\n```\nIn the above example, we have defined three XWiki-specific custom properties: `user.name`, `firstName`, and `lastName`. You can add as many of these custom user property definitions to your \"xwiki.properties\" file based on how many additional fields you want to map from your OpenID Connect provider.\n   \n4. Customize XWiki User Properties (if necessary): If the default properties provided by XWiki do not meet your requirements, or if they need further customization for handling special characters and formatting issues in user profile data coming from an OIDC Provider, you may have to modify some Java code within `xwiki-user.properties` file located under `/WEB-INF/classes`. This step is optional but recommended when dealing with complex or non-standardized user profiles that require additional processing before being stored as XWiki properties (e.g., converting special characters, trimming whitespace).\n   \n5. Test and Validate: After completing the above steps, restart your XWiki instance to apply these changes. Log in using an account from your OpenID Connect provider of choice that has additional profile fields populated with data other than email address (e.g., Google or Facebook accounts), then verify if those custom user properties are correctly mapped and displayed within your Wikispace as expected by testing them out on different pages where they should appear, such as the User Profile page (`/user`).\n   \nBy following these steps, you can successfully map additional OpenID Connect provider fields to specific XWiki user property values. Remember that this approach requires some knowledge of XML and Java programming languages along with familiarity working within a Wikispace environment like XWiki or similar open-source wiki software solutions such as Confluence Enterprise Edition (CE) from Atlassian Corporation Pty Ltd, which also supports OIDC authentication.",
