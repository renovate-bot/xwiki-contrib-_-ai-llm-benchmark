  "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5. Repeat for each (sub)wiki for which you need to set this configuration!",

If it\u2019dealings in WordPress or similar CMS that allows customizing media settings:\n\n1. Log into your admin dashboard of the wiki platform (e.g., MediaWiki). \n2. Navigate to 'Settings' and then find a section for upload size limits, which might be under \"Uploads\" or something similar depending on the CMS you are using. Here is where most platforms allow setting maximum file sizes:\n3. Set your desired limit (in this case, it would be 10MB). This will apply to all uploaded files across the wiki platform and not just attachments but also images in articles or other media-related content areas if applicable. If you want only image/PDF uploads restricted then look for a section specifically about file types where you can limit allowed extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf).\n4. Save the changes and inform your users of this new policy through an announcement or update in one of your wiki's articles explaining that only images/PDF files up to 10MB are accepted for attachments due to system limitations. This will help manage user expectations while maintaining transparency about why these restrictions exist (e.g., server capacity, bandwidth considerations).\n5. If the platform doesn\u2019t provide this functionality directly in settings or preferences menu, you may need a plugin/extension that allows for such customization if it's WordPress-based; alternatively, use .htaccess file to set maximum upload size and MIME type restrictions on your server level (if applicable).\n6. Remember always test these changes thoroughly before applying them live as they might affect the user experience or functionality of other parts of your wiki platform that rely on media files too!",
