You have the ability to disable this filter in the \"Advanced filtering options\" section of your own notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \n\n\nTo receive notifications regarding your activities in an XWiki environment, you typically need to adjust settings within both the application and possibly related notification services or plugins that are integrated with it. Here's a general guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Check User Permissions**: Ensure that as a user, you have permission rights set up in XWiki for receiving notifications about your own activities (if applicable). This might involve administrative privileges since notification settings can be sensitive and are often restricted based on roles within the system.\n\n2. **Review Application Settings**: Log into the admin panel of XWiki or consult with a site administrator to review any global user-specific setting that controls notifications for individual users, which may include enabling self-notifications if such an option exists in your version of XWiki. This might be found under settings related to 'Notifications' or similar sections within the admin interface.\n\n3. endregion \n# Self Contained Solution:\nTo enable yourself receiving notifications about activities on a system using XWiki, follow these steps assuming you have administrative privileges and that self-notifications are supported by your version of XWiki (as this feature is not standard in all versions):\n\n1. Log into the admin panel or contact an administrator to access settings related to user permissions:\n   - Navigate to the 'Users' section within the administration interface, where you can manage individual users and their roles/permissions.\n   \n2. Locate your profile among other profiles in this area of XWiki\u2019s admin panel. If self-notifications are supported by your version:\n   - Find a settings or preferences option for notifications within the user management interface, which might be under 'User Settings', 'Preferences' or similar sections where you can customize notification behavior.\n   \n3. Enable options that allow receiving notifications about personal activities if they exist in XWiki\u2019s admin panel:\n   - Look specifically for a checkbox labeled something like \"Receive Notifications About My Own Activities\" and enable it by checking the box or toggling an appropriate switch to 'On'. This option might not be available, so proceed with caution. If you cannot find such settings within XWiki itself:\n   \n4. Check for third-party plugins that extend notification capabilities in your version of XWiki (if applicable):\n   - Search the plugin repository or marketplace associated with your specific installation to see if there are any additional tools designed to enhance user notifications, including self-notifications. If you find a suitable one:\n   \n5. Install and configure third-party plugins as necessary:\n   - Download the appropriate notification extension from its source (often GitHub or another repository). Follow instructions for installation within your XWiki environment which may involve uploading files to specific directories, activating them through an admin interface, etc. Once installed:\n   \n6. Configure plugin settings if required by third-party tools:\n   - After installing the notification extension, access its configuration options via a dedicated section in the administration panel or within the tool's own user interface (if it has one). Adjust these to ensure that you receive notifications about your activities as intended. This might involve setting up email alerts for specific actions like creating pages, editing content, etc.\n   \n7. Test notification settings:\n   - Perform an action in XWiki where a change is expected (like adding or modifying wiki articles) and verify that you receive the appropriate notifications through your configured method of choice such as emails or system alerts within the interface itself if supported by plugins. If not, check plugin logs for errors during this test phase to troubleshoot any issues with notification delivery.\n   \n8. Review user permissions regularly:\n   - As an administrator, periodically review and adjust individual users' permission settings in case changes are needed over time or as roles within the organization evolve. This ensures that all relevant parties continue receiving appropriate notifications about activities on XWiki. \n\nIf after following these steps you still do not receive self-notifications:\n\n9. Reach out to technical support for your specific version of XWiki, if available, or consult the community forum associated with it (if one exists) where users and administrators might share insights on customizing notification settings in unique scenarios like yours. \n\n10. If self-notifications are not a feature supported by your current setup:\n    - Discuss this limitation openly within your organization to understand if there's an interest or need for such functionality, which could lead to future updates being made available that support it.",
