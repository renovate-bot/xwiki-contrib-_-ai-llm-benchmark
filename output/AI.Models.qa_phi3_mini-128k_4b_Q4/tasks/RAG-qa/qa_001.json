  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIf you are unable to find or use the bell icon (often used for alerts) on your XWiki installation even after installing an Alert Notification extension, there could be several reasons behind it. Here\u2019s a step-bydependent guide that might help resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Extension Installation**: Ensure that you have correctly installed and enabled the 'Alert Notification' extension by following these steps:\n   - Log in to your XWiki admin panel using an account with administrative privileges.\n   - Navigate to `Extensions` or a similar section where extensions are managed (the exact path may vary depending on your installation).\n   - Look for the Alert Notification extension and ensure it's installed, enabled, and properly configured according to its documentation. If not already done so, install and enable it by following any provided instructions specific to XWiki or third-party guides if necessary.\n   \n2. **Extension Configuration**: After installation, check that the bell icon is set up correctly within your extension settings (if applicable). Some extensions might require you to configure certain UI elements manually after they are installed. Look for any configuration options related to alerts and ensure everything is in place as per documentation or help sections of the extension.\n\n3. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure that the bell icon's display isn\u2019t being blocked by your browser due to extensions, pop-ups blockers, or other security settings. Try accessing XWiki from a different web browser and see if you can find the bell button there. If it appears in another browser but not yours, consider adjusting your current browser's settings accordingly.\n\n4. **Theme Compatibility**: Some extensions may only work with specific themes or might require certain styles to be present on XWiki for their UI elements like buttons and icons to display correctly. If you are using a custom theme that was not tested with the Alert Notification extension, try switching back to one of the default themes provided by XWiki (e.g., 'Xwiki' or 'Classic') temporarily to see if this resolves your issue.\n\n5. **Check for Updates**: Ensure you are using a compatible version of both XWiki and the Alert Notification extension, as compatibility issues can sometimes cause UI elements not to display correctly. Check their respective official websites for updates or release notes that mention changes related to alerts/bell icons.\n\n6. **Reinstall Extension (if necessary)**: If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Alert Notification extension as a last resort. Sometimes corrupted installation files can cause issues with UI elements not displaying correctly or functioning properly. Make sure to follow proper removal procedures for extensions in XWiki before installing it again.\n\n7. **Consult Documentation/Support**: If you are still unable to resolve the issue, consult the extension's official documentation and FAQ section first as there might be known issues with specific versions or configurations that have already been addressed by updates from the developers. Additionally, consider reaching out for support through XWiki\u2019s community channels if available (forums, user groups), providing details of your setup so they can offer more tailored advice.\n\n8. **Check Permissions**: Ensure you are logged in with an account that has sufficient permissions to access and configure the extension's features on XWiki. If necessary, ask a site administrator or someone with higher privileges for assistance if this is beyond your scope of control.\n\n9. **Browser Cache/Cookies Issue**: Clearing browser cache and cookies can sometimes resolve display issues as it forces browsers to reload resources from the server instead of using cached versions that might be outdated or corrupted. Remember, clearing data will remove saved login credentials too, so you'll need to log in again afterward.\n\n10. **Check for Conflicts**: If there are other extensions installed on your XWiki instance, they could potentially conflict with the Alert Notification extension and cause display issues. Try disabling all non-essential plugins one by one to identify if any of them is causing a problem. Re-enable each plugin individually afterward to test for conflicts.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be worth considering reaching out directly to XWiki's support team or checking their official social media channels and community resources where you can report such issues along with detailed information about your setup which could help them diagnose and provide a solution more effectively.",
