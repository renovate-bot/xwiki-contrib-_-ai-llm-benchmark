  "prompt": "Can I authenticate users with access tokens?",
  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can authenticate users with access tokens using the Token-based authentication for the LLM Application extension.\n\nThis extension allows external applications to authenticate users with signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The token needs to contain specific claims, such as expiration time, issuer, subject, and audience, and must be signed with an Ed25519 key.\n\nTo use this authenticator, you need to:\n\n1. Enable the token authenticator by setting the `xwiki.authentication.authclass` property in `xwiki.properties` file to `org.xwiki.contrib.llm.authentication.JWTTokenAuth`.\n2. Configure the authorized applications by adding a new entry to the \"Authorized Applications\" list, specifying the application's title, URL, public key, and group format.\n3. Generate a JWT token that meets the required claims and signing key requirements.\n4. Include the token in the \"Authorization\" header of the request in the form \"Bearer TOKEN\".\n\nNote that this authenticator only supports creating or updating users based on the information provided in the token and does not support using a token as authentication for an existing user that hasn't been created through this authenticator.",

The authenticator supports authenticating users from several applications that are mapped to distinct user accounts. When no token is present in the request, the authenticator falls back on a configurable authenticator and it should thus be able to combine this token authenticator with any other authenticator.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can enable this token authenticator by setting the xwiki.authentication.authclass\u00a0property in\u00a0xwiki.properties file to org.xwiki.contrib.llm.authentication.JWTTokenAuth. Alternatively, you can select the &quot;JWT Token Authenticator for the LLM AI Application&quot; in the [authentication configuration](https://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Authentication/#HChoosetheauthenticator).\n\nWhen there is no token in the request (see below), the authenticator falls back to the default authenticator. You can set the llm.authentication.jwt.authenticator property in xwiki.properties file to the authenticator that shall be used as fallback instead of the default authenticator.\n\n",
