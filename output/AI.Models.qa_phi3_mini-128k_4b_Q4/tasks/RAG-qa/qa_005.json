  "prompt": "How can I configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect?\nI've set up OpenID Connect authentication in my XWiki instance, but users are not automatically enabled after their first login. What configuration do I need to adjust?",
  "expected_answer": "To automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect in XWiki, you need to adjust the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nAdd or update the following property:\n\n```\n#-# Define if user accounts should be enabled (marked as active) on first login\n# oidc.enableUser=true\n```\n\nMake sure to uncomment and set the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true`. After making this change, save the file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.\n\nThis will ensure that new user accounts are automatically enabled when they log in for the first time via OpenID Connect.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Authentication/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LDAP/Authenticator/ \n\n\nTo have your XWiki instances auto-enable new or existing user accounts upon the successful completion of an initial OpenID Connect login flow, you'll typically want to implement a custom script that runs as part of the post-login process and checks for any newly created users. If no such scripts are already in place within your system, here is how you can approach this:\n\n1. **Create or Update User Scripts**: You will need user activation scripts which run after successful login but before access to protected resources like wiki pages becomes available. These scripts should be able to check for new users and enable them if necessary. Here's a pseudo-code example of what the script might look like, assuming you have an API endpoint or similar mechanism in place:\n\n```pseudo\nfunction activateNewUser(user) {\n    // Check if this is a newly created user (e.g., by checking creation date against login time).\n    \n    // If it's new and not already enabled, enable the account using your XWiki API or administrative interface:\n    apiCall(\"enableAccount\", {\"userId\": user.id});\n}\n```\n\n2. **Integrate with OpenID Connect Login Flow**: Ensure that after a successful login via OpenID Connect (which typically involves OAuth 2.0), your XWiki instance redirects the user to this script or an endpoint where it can be executed automatically, such as `/wiki/enable-user`.\n\n3. **Script Execution Trigger**: The activation scripts should only run once per login session for each new account and not on subsequent logins unless there's a reason (e.g., the user was disabled). This ensures that users don't get enabled multiple times unnecessarily, which could lead to confusion or security concerns.\n\n4. **Testing**: After implementing this script, thoroughly test it with various scenarios including different types of new accounts and existing ones where you want them automatically activated upon login for the first time using OpenID Connect. Make sure that your XWiki instance's user management system is updated to reflect these changes accurately in real-time without causing any disrufort or confusion among users during their initial setup phase.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Document this process clearly within your organization, explaining how new accounts are enabled and under what circumstances they might not be automatically activated (e.g., if the script encounters an error). This will help in maintaining transparency with users about their account statuses during initial setup phases or when issues arise that prevent automatic activation.\n\n6. **Backup Plan**: Always have a manual process to enable accounts as needed, especially for cases where automated scripts might fail due to unforeseen circumstances like network errors or misconfigurations in the OpenID Connect flow itself. This ensures continuity of service and user accessibility even when automatic processes do not work as expected.\n\nRemember that this is a high-level approach, and you'll need to adapt it based on your specific XWiki setup, available APIs or administrative interfaces, scripting language (e.g., Lua for Wikispaces), and the exact OpenID Connect implementation details of your organization. Always ensure compliance with data protection regulations when handling user information during these processes.",
