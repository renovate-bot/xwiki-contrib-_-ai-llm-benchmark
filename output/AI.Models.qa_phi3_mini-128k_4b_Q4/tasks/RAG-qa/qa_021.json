So the watch buttons might be in an undecided state if there&#x27;s an existing filter targeting the same location, but only some specific events, or some specific format. The idea is to inform the user that there&#x27;s already a filter for this location and that using the watch buttons might impact the filter.\u00a0\n\nIf a filter is not targeting all event types and all formats, and is actually in contradiction with the filter that would be created by the watch button, then this filter will be automatically disabled when using the watch button. For example, if a user had a filter to ignore all mentions on a space, then watching that exact same space will automatically disable that filter.
