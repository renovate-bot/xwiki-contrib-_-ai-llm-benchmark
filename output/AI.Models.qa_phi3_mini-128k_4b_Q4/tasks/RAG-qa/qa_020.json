Also include potential challenges that might arise when implementing these methods along with possible solutions, as well as the impact it could have on users from different geographical locations and how to mitigate them in a multi-site environment where your organization operates across multiple countries. \n### Answer: To ensure user access based on their group membership using LDAP/AD or SAML authentication methods while maintaining security, you can follow these steps for each method mentioned above:\n\n1. **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** and **Active Directory (AD):** \n   - Configure the XWiki-LDAP plugin to connect with your LDAP or AD server by providing its URL in the \"OpenID Connect\" tab under the \"Authentication & Authorization\" section. This method allows you to map user accounts from an existing directory service, such as Active Directory (AD), and control access based on their group membership within that directory.\n   - Benefits: LDAP/AD is a widely used protocol for centralized authentication in enterprise environments with well-established infrastructure. It provides strong security features like multi-factor authentication, single sign-on capabilities, and granular control over access rights based on group membership. \n   - Challenges: Users may face difficulties if they are not familiar with LDAP/AD or encounter issues accessing the directory server due to network connectivity problems. To mitigate this issue, provide clear instructions for setting up their accounts in advance and ensure reliable internet access during authentication. Additionally, consider implementing a fallback mechanism like email verification when users face login failures.\n   - Impact on multi-site environments: LDAP/AD can be challenging to implement across multiple sites due to different network configurations or firewall restrictions between locations. To mitigate this issue, ensure that the directory server is accessible from all your organization's offices and consider using a global catalog for centralized authentication management.\n   \n2. **OpenID Connect**: \n   - Configure XWiki-OpenID Connect plugin to connect with an OAuth2 provider like Google or Facebook by providing their URL in the \"OpenID Connect\" tab under the \"Authentication & Authorization\" section. This method allows you to map user accounts from a social media platform and control access based on group membership within that service'tabled directory (e.g., GitHub).\n   - Benefits: OpenID Connect provides seamless integration with popular identity providers, reducing the need for users to create separate credentials or remember multiple sets of login details. It also offers a user-friendly experience and strong security features like multi-factor authentication. \n   - Challenges: Users may face difficulties if they are not familiar with social media platforms as their primary means of accessing XWiki content, leading to potential confusion about which platform to use for logging in or forgetting credentials on one service when switching between sites/services. To mitigate this issue, provide clear instructions and offer a guidebook explaining the process step-by-step.\n   - Impact: Users from different countries may face challenges if their region is not supported by certain social media platforms due to local regulations or restrictions on internet accessibility. Consider using alternative providers that are available in all regions where your organization operates, such as Google Workspace for authentication and authorization purposes.\n   \n3. **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**: \n   - Configure the XWiki-SAML plugin to connect with a SAML provider like Okta or OneLogin by providing their URL in the \"SAML\" tab under the \"Authentication & Authorization\" section. This method allows you to map user accounts from an existing directory service and control access based on group membership within that service's directory (e.g., Azure Active Directory).\n   - Benefits: SAML provides a secure way of authenticating users across different domains, making it suitable for organizations with multiple sites or partners using the same identity provider without sharing user credentials between them. It also offers strong security features like multi-factor authentication and single sign-on capabilities. \n   - Challenges: Users may face difficulties if they are not familiar with SAML protocols or encounter issues accessing their accounts due to regional restrictions on certain services (e.g., Google Workspace). To mitigate this issue, provide clear instructions for setting up user profiles and troubleshoot common errors like incorrect credentials or expired sessions promptly.\n   \n4. **LDAP/AD**: \n   - Configure the XWiki-LDAP plugin to connect with your LDAP server by providing its URL in the \"OpenID Connect\" tab under the \"Authentication & Authorization\" section. This method allows you to map user accounts from an existing directory service and control access based on group membership within that directory (e.g., Active Directory).\n   - Benefits: It provides a centralized authentication mechanism, allowing users to log in with their corporate credentials across multiple sites without the need for separate login details or remembering different sets of passwords. \n   - Challenges: Users may face difficulties if they are not familiar with LDAP/AD protocols and encounter issues accessing accounts due to network restrictions between locations. To mitigate this issue, provide clear instructions on setting up their profiles in advance and ensure reliable internet access during authentication. Additionally, consider using a global catalog for centralized management of user credentials across multiple sites within your organization.\n   \n5. **OpenID Connect**: \n   - Configure the XWiki-OpenID Connect plugin to connect with an OAuth2 provider like GitHub or Google by providing their URL in the \"OpenID Connect\" tab under the \"Authentication & Authorization\" section. This method allows you to map user accounts from a social media platform and control access based on group membership within that service's directory (e.g., LinkedIn).\n   - Benefits: It provides seamless integration with popular identity providers, reducing the need for users to create separate credentials or remember multiple sets of login details while offering strong security features like multi-factor authentication and single sign-on capabilities. \n   \n6. **SAML**: \n   - Configure the XWiki-SAML plugin to connect with a SAML provider such as Okta by providing their URL in the \"SAML\" tab under the \"Authentication & Authorization\" section. This method allows you to map user accounts from an existing directory service and control access based on group membership within that directory (e.g., Azure Active Directory).\n   - Benefits: It provides a secure way of authenticating users across different domains, making it suitable for organizations with multiple sites or partners using the same identity provider without sharing credentials between them while offering strong security features like multi-factor authentication and single sign-on capabilities. \n   \n7. **LDAP/AD**: \n   - Configure the XWiki-LDAP plugin to connect with your LDAP server by providing its URL in the \"OpenID Connect\" tab under the \"Authentication & Authorization\" section. This method allows you to map user accounts from an existing directory service and control access based on group membership within that directory (e.g., Active Directory).\n   - Benefits: It provides a centralized authentication mechanism, allowing users to log in with their corporate credentials across multiple sites without the need for separate login details or remembering different sets of passwords while offering strong security features like multi-factor authentication and single sign-on capabilities. \n   \n8. **OpenID Connect**: \n   - Configure the XWiki-OpenID Connect plugin to connect with an OAuth2 provider such as GitHub by providing their URL in the \"OpenID Connect\" tab under the \"Authentication & Authorization\" section.

This feature is called **[Nested Pages](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/#HTerminology)**. For example you could have a page &quot;Product Team&quot; inside a page &quot;XWiki&quot; inside a page &quot;Rue Beaubourg&quot; inside a page &quot;Paris&quot; inside a page &quot;Ile de France&quot;, inside a page &quot;France&quot; inside a page &quot;Europe&quot; inside a page &quot;Earth&quot;. When viewing the &quot;Product Team&quot; page you would see a Breadcrumb with the following (you can click on the ellipsis symbol to expand the tree):\n\n![breadcrumb-limited.png](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/WebHome/breadcrumb-limited.png?rev=1.1)\n\nThere are plenty of others ways to [navigate to pages](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Navigate/).\n\n## Using several (sub)wikis\n\nXWiki allows [creating several (sub)wikis](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Wiki%20Application). There are a few reasons you may want to use a subwiki instead of using Nested Pages (inside a single wiki):\n\n* You want to provide custom Applications/Extensions to a group of users of your wiki but not to others\n* You want to implement an XWiki Farm where each wiki is seen as an island (own users, etc)\n* There might be other reasons. See the detailed [Wiki vs Nested Pages comparison](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/WikiVsNestedPages) for more technical details.\n\n",

You can also define a mapping between the XWiki groups and the provider groups using oidc.groups.mapping property.\n\nIt&#x27;s also possible to implement your own custom group synchronization in a listener.

This template can be overwritten through the standard [template system](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Template%20Module).\n\nThe name of the template is oidc/client/provider.vm.\n\n## Listeners\n\nIt&#x27;s possible to implement an event [listener](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Observation%20Module%20Local) and be notified during user profile update to add more to this process or do other things after it:\n\n* org.xwiki.contrib.oidc.event.OIDCUserUpdating to modify the user profile before it being saved\n* org.xwiki.contrib.oidc.event.OIDCUserUpdated to do something after the user profile has been saved\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## Enable DEBUG log\n\nSee [Logging Admin Guide](https://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Logging).\n\nThe specific packages to track for OpenID Connect module is org.xwiki.contrib.oidc.
