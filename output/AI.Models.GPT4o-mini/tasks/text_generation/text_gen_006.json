  "ai_answer": "In whispered winds and rustling leaves,  \nNature\u2019s song, a heart that weaves,  \nWith golden rays of morning light,  \nShe wakes the world, a pure delight.  \n\nThe mountains stand, their peaks adorned,  \nIn robes of green, where dreams are born,  \nWith rivers dancing, swift and free,  \nThey carve the earth, a symphony.  \n\nThe blossoms bloom in vibrant hues,  \nA palette drawn from heaven\u2019s muse,  \nFrom cherry pink to azure skies,  \nEach petal holds a thousand sighs.  \n\nThe whispering pines, the ancient oaks,  \nIn shadows deep, where silence chokes,  \nThey tell of time, of seasons past,  \nA history that\u2019s unsurpassed.  \n\nThe ocean\u2019s roar, the gentle tide,  \nA canvas vast, where secrets hide,  \nWith shells like treasures on the shore,  \nEach wave a tale, forevermore.  \n\nThe starlit nights, the moon\u2019s embrace,  \nIn cosmic dance, a timeless grace,  \nThe galaxy, a jeweled thread,  \nIn every heart, its wonder spreads.  \n\nSo let us walk on paths of green,  \nIn nature\u2019s arms, where peace is seen,  \nFor in her beauty, we find our place,  \nA sacred bond, a warm embrace.",
