  "prompt": "How can I configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect?\nI've set up OpenID Connect authentication in my XWiki instance, but users are not automatically enabled after their first login. What configuration do I need to adjust?",
  "expected_answer": "To automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect in XWiki, you need to adjust the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nAdd or update the following property:\n\n```\n#-# Define if user accounts should be enabled (marked as active) on first login\n# oidc.enableUser=true\n```\n\nMake sure to uncomment and set the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true`. After making this change, save the file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.\n\nThis will ensure that new user accounts are automatically enabled when they log in for the first time via OpenID Connect.",

Look for the `oidc.automaticUserCreation` property and set it to `true`. \nHere's how the relevant part of your `xwiki.cfg` should look like: \n\n```\n# OIDC Configuration - OpenID Connect authentication settings\nxwiki.authentication.authclass=org.xwiki.auth.OpenIDConnectAuthenticator\noidc.automaticUserCreation=true\n```\nMake sure to restart your XWiki instance after making this change for it to take effect. With this setting, when a user logs in for the first time using OpenID Connect, their account will be automatically created if it doesn't exist.",

It requires a user and a password.\n\n## Basic Authentication\n\nXWiki supports [basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), a method designed to allow a web browser or other client programs to provide credentials - in the form of a user name and password - when making a request. You can get authenticated against an XWiki server with the basic authentication protocol using the following URL scheme:\n\nhttps://username:password@mywiki.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome?basicauth=1  \nBe careful that if you use the HTTP protocol your password will be sent in clear over the network and is thus very unsafe. When using basic authentication you should make sure your wiki is configured to use HTTPS.\n\n",
