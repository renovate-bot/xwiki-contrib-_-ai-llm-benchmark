  "prompt": "I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nYou might have the auto-watch mode turned on by default, which watches all pages you visit. \n\nTo turn this off go to your [User Profile](https://yourwikisitename.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome), click on the Settings tab in the top menu and then select Notifications from the left sidebar. Next, scroll down a bit until you see the Auto-watch mode section and select *None* from the dropdown list. This will stop following changes to all pages and only receive notifications about the ones you manually watch. Alternatively, you can also choose the *Watch pages I create or comment on* option which could be a good middle ground if you want to be notified when your contributions generate new activity. \n\nIf this doesn't solve your issue make sure also that you don't have any specific applications enabled in your notifications settings which might be generating those unwanted emails. To check that go again to the Settings -> Notifications section and make sure all the applications there are turned off if you want to receive fewer emails. You can always turn them back on later individually if you change your mind.",
