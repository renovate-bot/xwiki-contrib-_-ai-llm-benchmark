  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nTo address this issue and make the Bell (new notification alerts) visible in the top-right corner of your XWiki installation even after installing the 'Alert Notification' extension, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to Extensions > Alert Notifications: New Messages (or any similar name depending on which language is set up for XWiki). This should open a page where you can manage your alert notifications settings.\n2. Verify that the 'Show new notification icon in toolbar' option is checked or enabled. If it's not, select the checkbox to enable the notification bell icon. \n3. Save all changes and return back to XWiki homepage. The Notification Bell should now be visible in the top-right corner of your XWiki installation, depending on which theme you are currently using.\n4. If for some reason it still does not appear, try clearing browser cache/cookies and then refreshing the page. You can also test whether there is a problem with a specific user or account by switching to another user and checking if the bell icon appears there.\n5. As an alternative approach, you could contact your system administrator in case other settings are limiting visibility of notifications or additional permissions/restrictions have been set on your XWiki instance that might impact the notification behavior. \n6. It is also important to note that not all themes support this bell icon in every location (top-right corner) by default. You may need a theme customization solution, or switch to another theme if you really want to have this feature available at your desired place on the page.\n\nBy following these steps and confirming each one's success, you should be able to resolve the issue with the Bell notification icon being unavailable in the top right corner of XWiki after installing the 'Alert Notification' extension. If none of these solutions work for your specific case, reaching out for further assistance would be advisable.",

Note that installing Extensions when being offline is currently not supported and you&#x27;d need to use some [complex manual method](https://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/#HOthermethods).\n\nYou can also use the following manual method, which is useful if this extension cannot be installed with the Extension Manager or if you&#x27;re using an old version of XWiki that doesn&#x27;t have the Extension Manager:\n\n1. Log in the wiki with a user having Administration rights\n2. Go to the Administration page and select the Import category\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload the downloaded XAR\n4. Click on the uploaded XAR and follow the instructions\n5. You&#x27;ll also need to install all [dependent Extensions](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HDependencies) that are not already installed in your wiki\n\n",
