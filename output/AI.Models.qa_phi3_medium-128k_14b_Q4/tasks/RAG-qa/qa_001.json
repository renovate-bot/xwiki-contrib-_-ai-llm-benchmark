  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nTo resolve the issue with the bell icon being unavailable in XWiki even after installing the AlertNotification extension, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Check Extension Dependencies: Enspector or XWiki Manager (depending on your installation) to check for any missing dependencies that the AlertNotification extension might require. If there are any missing extensions, install them accordingly. The specific dependent extension could be 'XWiki-Bell' which is responsible for bell notifications in XWiki.\n\n2. Clear cache: Sometimes, caching issues can cause icons or components to not appear correctly. Try clearing the cache of your browser and restart it. Additionally, consider invalidating the cache via the web administration interface in XWiki (if available). You can usually find this under System > Maintenance or a similar menu structure.\n\n3. Reinstall Extension: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, try re-downloading and reinstalling the AlertNotification extension from its official source to ensure that you have the latest version with all dependencies intact. Follow the installation instructions provided by the XWiki community or in the extension documentation.\n\n4. Check Configuration: The availability of features like bell notifications also depends on their configuration within the wiki settings file (e.g., /conf/config.mgmt). Review these configurations to ensure that they match your expectations and the requirements for using bell notifications. You might find setting related to AlertNotification or XWiki-Bell extensions there.\n\n5. Consult Community Forums: If you continue to have issues, consider posting a question on relevant community forums like Stack Exchange's XWiki Q&A site or Apache's XWiki mailing list with details about your environment and the steps you've taken so far. You may receive guidance from other experienced users who can help debug the issue more effectively.\n\nRemember to backup your configuration files before making any changes, as a precautionary measure against potential data loss or unintended behavior due to erroneous configurations.",
