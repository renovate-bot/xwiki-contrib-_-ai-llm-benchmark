  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nThe bell icon or alert notification feature might not be visible due to various reasons such as the extension being disabled or not properly configured. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Ensure that the `Notifications Application` extension has been successfully installed and enabled in your XWiki platform. You could use the Extension Manager for installation, but if this doesn't work, follow a manual method by logging into the wiki as an admin user, navigating to the Administration page, selecting Import category, uploading the .XAR file of the extension and following the on-screen instructions.\n\n2. Once installed, ensure that all dependent extensions have also been installed in your XWiki platform as listed here(https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HDependencies). These dependencies are crucial for the proper functioning of the extension and should be properly configured.\n\n3. The `Alerts Application` is required to contribute content in the Alert menu where the bell icon appears as a notification indicator (source: documents 1&3,4). If this application is not installed or enabled, the bell icon might not show up. You can follow the same installation procedure for the alerts application extension.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and still don't see the icon, there could be some other issues involved that are more specific to your XWiki platform setup. In such cases, it would help if you shared additional details so that we can provide a more detailed solution. \n\nPlease note that as per the provided document (source: documents 1), installing extensions while offline isn't supported and might require complex manual methods. Always ensure your XWiki platform is up to date. If these steps don't resolve your issue, it could be helpful to reach out to the XWiki community or their help desk for more personalized assistance.",
