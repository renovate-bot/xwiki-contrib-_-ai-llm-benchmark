  "prompt": "How do I configure group synchronization between XWiki and my OpenID Connect provider?\nI'm using an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims, and I want to synchronize these groups with XWiki groups. What's the process for setting this up?",
  "expected_answer": "To configure group synchronization between XWiki and your OpenID Connect provider 1. Locate the `xwiki.properties` file in your XWiki installation directory.\n2. Open the file with a text editor.\n3. Configure the group synchronization by setting the `oidc.groups.claim` property to the name of the claim used by your OpenID Connect provider to send group information. For example:\n```java\n#-# The name of the claim used to get the list of groups the user belong to.\n# oidc.groups.claim=groups\n```\nReplace `groups` with the actual claim name provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. If your OpenID Connect provider sends group memberships as a single value attribute delimited by a specific character (e.g., a comma), configure the `oidc.groups.separator` property with the appropriate character:\n```java\n#-# If the identity provider returns group memberships as a single value attribute delimited with a char, for example:\n# oidc.groups.separator=,\n```\nReplace the comma with the actual separator used by your provider.\n1. If you want to map the synchronized groups to specific XWiki groups, configure the `oidc.groups.mapping` property with the appropriate mappings:\n```java\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup\"=group1\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup2\"=group2\n```\nReplace `MyXWikiGroup` and `MyXWikiGroup2` with the names of the XWiki groups you want to map, and `group1` and `group2` with the actual group names provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. Save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \n\n\nTo configure group synchronization in XWike between your XWiki instance and an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that supports group claims, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure OIDC Group Claims Compatibility**: Firstly, verify if your OIDC provider allows the sending of group claims in its access token payload. This is a requirement for XWiki to be able to read and synchronize groups correctly. \n\n2. **Update Your OpenID Connect Configuration on XWiki**: On the XWiki server, you need to update your OAuth configuration to include `groupId` as part of the claims that are returned in the access token. This can typically be done by adding a custom claim mapper or adjusting your existing ones if provided by the OIDC provider.\n\n3. **Modify XWiki User Profiles**: Once you have ensured group claims are supported and configured on XWiki, modify user profiles to include fields for each group that should be synchronized. This could involve creating columns or attributes in the user profile schema specifically for group membership information.\n\n4. **Implement a Synchronization Plugin (if needed)**: If your OIDC provider doesn't provide built-in support for automatic group claim transfer, you may need to implement a custom plugin for XWiki that will handle this synchronization by making additional API calls or periodic polling based on the OIDC tokens obtained when users authenticate.\n\n5. groovy **Regular Synchronization/Sync Job**: Set up a scheduled job within XWiki that periodically checks group membership information in your OIDC provider and updates user profiles accordingly. This can also be done via the admin interface or programmatically through a script, depending on how often you want to sync groups.\n\n6. **Security Considerations**: Ensure that proper security measures are in place when handling group claims data during synchronization. You should verify the identity of users and ensure secure transmission of authentication tokens between your applications and servers.\n\nThis configuration ensures that user profiles on XWiki will accurately reflect their current groups as defined by your OIDC provider, maintaining accurate access control and permissions throughout your system.",
