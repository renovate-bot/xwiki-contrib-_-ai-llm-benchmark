  "prompt": "How do I configure group synchronization between XWiki and my OpenID Connect provider?\nI'm using an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims, and I want to synchronize these groups with XWiki groups. What's the process for setting this up?",
  "expected_answer": "To configure group synchronization between XWiki and your OpenID Connect provider 1. Locate the `xwiki.properties` file in your XWiki installation directory.\n2. Open the file with a text editor.\n3. Configure the group synchronization by setting the `oidc.groups.claim` property to the name of the claim used by your OpenID Connect provider to send group information. For example:\n```java\n#-# The name of the claim used to get the list of groups the user belong to.\n# oidc.groups.claim=groups\n```\nReplace `groups` with the actual claim name provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. If your OpenID Connect provider sends group memberships as a single value attribute delimited by a specific character (e.g., a comma), configure the `oidc.groups.separator` property with the appropriate character:\n```java\n#-# If the identity provider returns group memberships as a single value attribute delimited with a char, for example:\n# oidc.groups.separator=,\n```\nReplace the comma with the actual separator used by your provider.\n1. If you want to map the synchronized groups to specific XWiki groups, configure the `oidc.groups.mapping` property with the appropriate mappings:\n```java\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup\"=group1\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup2\"=group2\n```\nReplace `MyXWikiGroup` and `MyXWikiGroup2` with the names of the XWiki groups you want to map, and `group1` and `group2` with the actual group names provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. Save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Authentication/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI \n\n\nConfiguring group synchronization between XWike and your OpenID Connect Provider requires a few steps. Please follow below mentioned steps carefully:\n\n1. **Enable Group Synchronisation**: First, enable group synchronisation in the XWiki Connector Admin Tool by checking the \"Synchronize Groups\" option under Settings > General Configuration > Connected Identity. This will ensure that you can manage your groups within Xwiki.\n \n2. **Update Authentication URL**: You also need to add a 'Group Claims' filter in your authentication settings on your OpenID Provider. Update the \"Authentication Request\" parameter to include 'groupclaims'. For example, if your current value is `http://example.com/auth/?client_id=openid`, update it like this:\n`http://example.primefaces.org/connect?provider=your_oidc&scope=openid+profile+email&client_id=openid&response_type=code&redirect_uri=&state={randomString}&groupclaims=true`. Note that the URL includes \"groupclaims=true\", which enables group synchronisation.\n   \n3. **Configure XWiki Connect Admin Tool**: Go to your Connector in Xwiki > User Groups and add new groups for each group available in your OpenID Provider. You can also configure mapping of these groups between the OIDC provider's group claims and Xwiki. For example, you might have a \"Developers\" role on your OIDC provider that maps to an existing Developer Group within XWiki or create it if needed.\n   \n4. **Set up User Sync**: Make sure to set up user sync (user synchronization) by going to Settings > General Configuration > Connected Identity and setting 'Sync Users' on. This allows users to log in through OIDC and their account will be updated as they are authenticated and/or synchronized.\n \n5. **Update User Sync**: Under the \"Synchronize Users\" section, select groups that should trigger an update of a user when added or removed. You can configure this to happen automatically when changes occur on your OIDC Provider's group claims or manually triggered within XWiki Connector Admin Tool.\n \n6. **Test it out**: After you have updated both the authentication and synchronization configurations, test them by logging in as a user who is part of a new group that was added to your OIDC Provider. Once they are authenticated through the OpenID Connect login page or \"Log In Using Single Sign On\", their account should be automatically updated with access granted or denied depending on whether Xwiki has enabled synchronization for that specific group in question (check user sync section of settings).\n   \n7. **Configure Membership Permissions**: Now, users need to be able to modify groups and grant permissions within your XWiki site as per the setup above. This can usually be achieved by editing permissions at Connector Admin > Users or Connector Admin > Group Settings > User Rights on OIDC Groups you've configured for syncing with specific user roles or capabilities on Xwiki pages, widgets, etc., that have access to such control panels.\n \nBy following these steps carefully, you should be able to synchronize group membership between your OpenID Connect provider and XWiki smoothly.",
