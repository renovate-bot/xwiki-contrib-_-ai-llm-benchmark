  "prompt": "Can I customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki?\nI want to map additional user profile fields from my OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. How can I achieve this?",
  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider by mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nTo map additional user profile fields, use the `oidc.user.mapping` property. Here's an example of how to map custom properties:\n\n```\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}\n```\n\nReplace `myxproperty1` and `myxproperty2` with the actual XWiki user property names, and `${oidc.user.subject}` with the appropriate variable based on the data provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n\nAfter configuring the mappings, save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart XWiki to apply the changes.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \n\n\nYes, you can map additional user profile fields from your OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to the XWiki user properties. This is done by using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file. The `oidc.user.mapping` property defines a mapping between custom properties coming from the OIDC provider and the XWiki side.\n\nHere's an example of how to map additional user profile fields:\n\n```java\n// Map myXproperty1 from the OpenID Connect provider to the XWiki userProfile\noidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}\n\n// Map myxproperty2 from the OpenID Connect provider to a prefixed form of oidc.user.subject in xwikiUserProperties\noidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}\n```\n\nIn these mappings, replace `myXproperty1` and `myXproperty2` with the names of your custom user profile fields from the OIDC provider that you want to map. The `${oidc.user.subject}` part corresponds to the default user identifier in XWiki as generated by OpenID Connect (OIDC).\n\nThis mapping should be included under the `xwiki` section in the `xwiki.properties` file, which is typically located at `/etc/xwiki/xwiki-config/xwiki.properties`. You might need administrative access to edit this file.\n\nPlease ensure you follow your organization's policy regarding changes to system configurations and consult with your IT department if necessary before making any modifications.",
