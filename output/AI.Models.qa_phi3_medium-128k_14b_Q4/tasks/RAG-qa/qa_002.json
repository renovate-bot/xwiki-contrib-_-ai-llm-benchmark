  "prompt": "Why am I not receiving any notifications in XWiki.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \n\n\nThere could be a variety of reasons you might not be receiving any notifications from your XWiki account, including issues with settings, server-side problems or connectivity concerns on the client end. Here's how you can check and troubleshoot:\n\n1. Check if Notifications are Enabled:\n   - Navigate to the 'Account Settings' section of XWike (accessible from your profile) and ensure that 'Notifications' is enabled. If it isn't, enable this feature so you will begin receiving notifications about activity in wikis where you have watch rights or subscribe.\n   \n2. Check Your Email Provider:\n   - Verify the email address linked to your XWiki account as this is where all notification emails are sent out. Confirm that there's no spam filtering system blocking these messages on your side. \n\n3. Server-side Issues or Downtime:\n    - While less common, XWiki may experience server-side issues from time to time which can impact notifications functionality. Visit the 'System Status' page in your admin panel for realtime updates about the health and performance of all XWiki components including Email Server and Mailer service. \n\n4. Application or Browser Problems:\n   - Sometimes, application bugs or browser settings may be causing this issue as well. Try logging out from XWiki then re-login again to ensure you've got the most up-to-date version of the software with all recent bug fixes and patches applied. Also, try using a different web browser if the problem persists in your current one. \n\n5. Internet Connection:\n   - Confirm that your device is connected properly to the internet because an intermittent connection can cause notifications not reaching you. Check other websites or online services on the same devices/networks as well and compare the results with your situation.\n   \n6. Contacting XWiki Support: \n    - If none of these solutions help, it is best to contact XWiki support. They might need to see server logs and other technical details from your side to troubleshoot further which they can guide you on how to do safely.",
