  "prompt": "Why am I not receiving any notifications in XWiki.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \n\n\nYou might not be receiving any notifications due to a few possible reasons:\n\n- You may need to start watching users and enable application types for notifications, as per the user profile section. By default, nothing is watched unless something is enabled or watched. This setting changed in XWiki version 15.5+ where all application types are enabled by default but you still won't receive anything until you manually watch something and choose some application types to enable.\n- If you have not performed any editions after the change in settings, notifications will not be received as per the mechanism mentioned. It is only when users perform certain actions that specific application types automatically get enabled.\n\nYou can also control your notification filters for events such as own activity, read status or minor events from your profile under the \"network\" tab and the \"Advanced filtering options\". You have an option to disable these filters based on your preferences.",

There is a mechanism to automatically enable some application types whenever the users perform editions.\n\nXWiki 15.5+ Starting with this version, by default nothing is watched for new users.
