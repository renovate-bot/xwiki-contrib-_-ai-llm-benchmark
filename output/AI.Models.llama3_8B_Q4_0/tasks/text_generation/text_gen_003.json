  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Hey there, young adventurer!\n\nHave you ever seen a plant grow and thrive in the sun? Maybe you've watched your mom or dad tend to their garden, making sure those plants get just the right amount of sunlight. Well, guess what? Plants have a special power that helps them use that sunshine to make their own food!\n\nIt's called photosynthesis (say it with me: foh-toh-see-MAH-si-thuns). It's like a magic trick where plants turn sunlight into a yummy snack that gives them energy to grow big and strong. They use this snack, called glucose, to fuel all sorts of activities like growing new leaves, developing roots, and even making flowers bloom!\n\nSo, the next time you see a plant stretching towards the sun, remember: it's not just reaching for warmth \u2013 it's actually cooking up its own food using that sunshine! Pretty cool, right?",
