Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5. Repeat for each (sub)wiki for which you need to set this configuration!",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Attachment/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Attachments \n\n\nYou can configure XWiki to restrict attachment types and sizes.\n\nFirstly, you need to install the Attachment Validation Application extension. This extension will allow you to define restrictions for attachment types and sizes.\n\nAfter installing the extension, go to the Administration UI (usually at `http://yourwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Space/AdministrationUI`) and follow these steps:\n\n1. Click on \"Attachments Restriction\" in the left menu.\n2. In the \"Attachment Types\" section, add a new line with the following settings:\n\t* Mimetype: `image/*`\n\t* Extension: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif` (you can add more image extensions if needed)\n3. Click on \"Add\"\n4. In the same section, add another new line with the following settings:\n\t* Mimetype: `application/pdf`\n5. Click on \"Add\"\n\nNext, configure the maximum upload size for attachments:\n\n1. Go to `http://yourwiki.com/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the value to `10485760` (which is equivalent to 10MB)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n\nNote that you might need to clear your browser's cache for these changes to take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, only images and PDF files of at maximum 10MB will be allowed as attachments on your wiki.",
