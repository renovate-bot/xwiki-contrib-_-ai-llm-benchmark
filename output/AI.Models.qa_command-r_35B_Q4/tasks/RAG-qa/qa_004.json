  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nTo stop getting notifications for changes on any page or new page creations, you have two options:\n\n1. Disable email notifications globally: As an XWiki user, you can completely disable email notifications by going to your User Profile page and unchecking the \"Send me mail notifications\" option under the \"Mail Notifications\" section. This will ensure that you receive no further emails for any XWiki changes or updates.\n\n2. Unwatch specific pages or spaces: If you only want to stop notifications for specific pages or entire namespaces/spaces, you can do so by unwatching them. \n - For individual pages, click on the \"Watch\" button at the top right corner of the page while in edit mode and then click \"Stop watching this page\". \n - To unwatch an entire space, go to the space's overview page (usually named SpaceName Home) and find the \"Watch\" link in the sidebar. Click it and select \"Stop watching this space\".\n\nDisabling or unwatching these notifications will ensure that you no longer receive emails about changes or updates to the pages or spaces you're not interested in.",
