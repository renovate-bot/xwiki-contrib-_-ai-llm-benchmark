  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nTo fix the issue with the bell icon not being visible in the top right corner in XWiki, you should check if the following conditions are met:\n\n1. Confirm that you are using a recent version of XWiki (e.g., 13.x or higher). The bell icon and the related features were introduced in newer versions of XWiki.\n\n2. Ensure that your XWiki instance has the necessary rights and permissions set up correctly. The appearance of the bell icon may be affected by the user's permissions and the wiki's settings. Contact your wiki administrator if you don't have permission to make changes.\n\n3. Verify that the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed correctly. If it's not, you can install it from the XWiki Marketplace. Go to your XWiki's administration panel, select \"Extensions\" and search for \"Alert Notification.\" If it's not available, follow the installation instructions provided in the marketplace description.\n\n4. After installing the 'Alert Notification' extension, log out and log back into your XWiki account. Sometimes, this action is necessary to reload the user interface components correctly.\n\n5. If the bell icon still doesn't appear, check if there are any error messages or hints in the browser's developer tools. Open the developer tools (usually accessible by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting 'Inspect' or 'Developer Tools') and see if there are any indications of errors or missing resources.\n\n6. Contact the XWiki community for further assistance: If none of the above steps solve the issue, reach out to the XWiki community or your organization's IT team for additional help. They can provide more tailored guidance based on your specific XWiki setup and configuration.\n\nThe 'Bell' icon in XWiki is related to receiving notifications about various events happening within the wiki, such as page changes, comments, etc. It's a helpful feature to stay updated, so getting it working correctly is useful.",
