  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",

Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. Create a new space for each team, if you haven't already.\n\n2. Make sure that each space has an identical structure of groups and permissions. For example, you might have \"Team A Members\" and \"Team B Members\" groups with different levels of permission in each space.\n\n3. Give read permission to everyone on all spaces. This will allow all teams to view all spaces. You can do this by going to the respective Space Settings > Permissions and adding a group called \"Everyone\" (or equivalent) and granting it Read permission.\n\n4. Now, give write/edit permissions only to the respective team in their designated space. For example, grant \"Team A Members\" group with Edit permission in the space belonging to Team A, and similarly for other teams.\n\n5. If you want to ensure that even administrators can't modify certain spaces, you can also consider using the RestrictedSpace feature in XWiki. This would require an extra step of assigning the right restrictions, but it ensures no one can modify those spaces without the correct permissions.\n\nRemember that the exact steps might vary slightly based on your XWiki version and setup, so make sure to consult the documentation or reach out to XWiki support if needed.",

(which is used for hierarchical navigation purposes)\n\nNote that both are independent: a page can have a parent Page in a different Space/Wiki than its own .\n\nWhile this was working, we&#x27;ve found that it could create confusion for users, leading to questions such as:\u00a0\n\n* Should I create a sub-Wiki or a Space for my team?\n* Which navigation should I put on my home page: list of Spaces or tree view of Pages?\n* Can I set rights on a page that is under a space?\n\nAt the same time, for a long time there have been discussions on the list about the future &quot;new model&quot; of XWiki, which would ideally include  \nNested Spaces, offering the following features:\u00a0\n\n* Unified way to handle hierarchical navigation (Page &gt; Sub-page &gt; Sub-sub-page &gt;...)\n* Navigation reflected in URLs (.../PageA/PageB/PageC)\n* Inheritance of access rights (rights on PageA apply to PageB and PageC, unless defined otherwise. Rights on PageB supersede those on PageA  \nand also apply to PageC, and so on.)\n\nIn the end, we took the opportunity to move from the previous way to this new way of organizing pages in XWiki 7.2.\n\n",

      "content": "### Parent/Child relationship\n\nThe user was able to specify a **parent** page for each page he had created. This parent could have been any page, for example the page Movies.ItsAWonderfulLife could have Directors.FrankCapra as parent. Then ItsAWonderfulLife was listed as Child of FrankCapra. This relationship was displayed in the *breadcrumb* at the top of each page. The user was able to navigate through this *hierarchy*.\u00a0\n\nSome applications used this parent/child relationship to organize their data. For them, this relationship is crucial.\n\n### The introduction of the Nested Pages concept\n\nIn XWiki 7.2, due to frequent users demands, we have introduced the ability to create spaces under other spaces. It&#x27;s the **Nested Spaces** concept. We suddenly had the ability to create a hierarchy of spaces to organize content.\n\nBut we have also found some issues. What if a space has the same name as a page? Which entry should we render to the user when he reaches an URL where two entities match? Moreover, does it make sense to have a difference between a space and a page? Why couldn&#x27;t pages have sub-pages inside of them?\n\nWe then have decided to switch to the **Nested Pages** concept. In theory, a page should now be able to have some sub-pages, because we don&#x27;t need to have a distinction between a page and a space like we have between a file and a folder.\n\nBut this change was not possible to make at the API level because it would have required too much work that we could not afford at this time (and breaking backward-compatibility incidentally since it would have required a complete model change). So the decision was made to stick to the **Nested Spaces** implementation at the API level (for now), but to propose **Nested Pages** at the UI level.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n",
