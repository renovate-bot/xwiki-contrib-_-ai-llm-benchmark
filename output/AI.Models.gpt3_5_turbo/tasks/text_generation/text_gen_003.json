  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Photosynthesis is like a superpower that plants have! They use sunlight to make their own food, kind of like how we eat to have energy. So, when you see a plant soaking up the sun, it's actually making its own energy to grow big and strong. Cool, right?",
