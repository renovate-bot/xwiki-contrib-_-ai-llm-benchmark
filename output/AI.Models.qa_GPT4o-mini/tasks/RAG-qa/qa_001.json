  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIf the 'Bell' icon for notifications is not appearing in XWiki even after installing the 'Alerts Notification' extension, here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue:\n\n1. **Check Extension Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of the 'Alerts Notification' extension you have installed is compatible with your version of XWiki. Sometimes, features may not work properly if there are compatibility issues.\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: Go to the XWiki Administration area and check if the 'Alerts Notification' extension shows as installed. You can do this by navigating to **Administration > Extensions**. If it's not installed correctly, try reinstalling it.\n\n3. **User Permissions**: Ensure that the user account you are using has the appropriate permissions to view notifications. You may need administrative rights to see certain features.\n\n4. **Browser Issues**: Sometimes, browser extensions or settings can interfere with how XWiki displays content. Try clearing your browser cache or using a different web browser to see if the issue persists.\n\n5. **JavaScript Errors**: Since the notifications rely on JavaScript, check your browser's developer console (usually accessible via F12) for any JavaScript errors that might indicate what the issue is.\n\n6. **Configuration Settings**: Go to **Administration > Notifications** and check the settings related to notifications. Ensure that notifications are enabled and that no settings are preventing their display.\n\n7. **Check for Other Extensions**: Conflicts with other installed extensions could potentially cause the notification feature to malfunction. Consider disabling other extensions temporarily to see if this resolves the issue.\n\n8. **Review Logs**: Check the XWiki logs for any error messages that might indicate problems with loading the notification feature.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, consider reaching out to the XWiki community or support forums with specific details about your installation and the steps you've taken so far.",
