  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIf the 'Bell' icon for notifications is not appearing in the top right corner of your XWiki, even after installing the Alert Notification extension, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Check Extension Installation**: Ensure that the Alert Notification extension is correctly installed. You can do this by going to the Administration page, navigating to the Extensions section, and verifying that the extension is listed as installed.\n\n2. **Enable Notifications**: Make sure that the notifications module is enabled. You can check this in the `xwiki.properties` file to ensure that the following line is set:\n   ```\n   notifications.enabled = true\n   ```\n\n3. **Permissions**: Verify that your user account has the necessary permissions to view notifications. The user may need specific rights to see the notification bell.\n\n4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes, browser caching issues can prevent the UI from updating correctly. Clear your browser cache and reload the XWiki page.\n\n5. **Check for Errors**: Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) and check the console for any JavaScript errors that might be interfering with the loading of the notifications.\n\n6. **Restart XWiki**: If changes have been made to the configuration, restart the XWiki server to ensure that all settings are applied properly.\n\n7. **Check for Conflicts**: If you have other extensions installed, there might be conflicts. Try disabling other extensions temporarily to see if the bell appears.\n\n8. **Review Logs**: Finally, check the XWiki logs for any errors related to the notifications module. This can provide insight into what might be going wrong.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues after trying these steps, you may want to consult the XWiki community or forums for additional assistance.",

When a blog post is published?\n\nYou can enable or disable all notification types that belong to a particular application by clicking on the bells associated to this application. If some types are enabled and other are disabled inside an application, the switch looks like the next screenshot, meaning that the application&#x27;s notifications are partially enabled:\n\n![NotifUndeterminate.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifUndeterminate.png?rev=1.3)\n\nNote that you only receive notifications that occur after you turn on the notifications types.\n\n",

Note that installing Extensions when being offline is currently not supported and you&#x27;d need to use some [complex manual method](https://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/#HOthermethods).\n\nYou can also use the following manual method, which is useful if this extension cannot be installed with the Extension Manager or if you&#x27;re using an old version of XWiki that doesn&#x27;t have the Extension Manager:\n\n1. Log in the wiki with a user having Administration rights\n2. Go to the Administration page and select the Import category\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload the downloaded XAR\n4. Click on the uploaded XAR and follow the instructions\n5. You&#x27;ll also need to install all [dependent Extensions](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HDependencies) that are not already installed in your wiki\n\n",
