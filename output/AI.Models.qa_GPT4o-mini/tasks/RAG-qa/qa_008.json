  "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5. Repeat for each (sub)wiki for which you need to set this configuration!",

This can typically be done by using the Attachment Validation Application.\n   - In your XWiki properties (usually found in the `xwiki.cfg` file), you should define the allowed mime-types. You can specify a whitelist of accepted mime types like this:\n\n     ```\n     attachment.validation.mimeTypes=image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif,application/pdf\n     ```\n\n3. **Configure Attachment Validation**:\n   - Make sure the Attachment Validation application is installed and configured properly in your XWiki. This will enforce the restrictions set in the previous steps.\n\n4. **Restart Your Wiki**:\n   - After making these changes, it's a good idea to restart your XWiki instance to ensure that all configurations are loaded correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively restrict the upload of attachments to only images and PDF files with a size limit of 10MB across your entire wiki.",
