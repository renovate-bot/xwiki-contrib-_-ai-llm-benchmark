  "prompt": "Can I customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki?\nI want to map additional user profile fields from my OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. How can I achieve this?",
  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider by mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nTo map additional user profile fields, use the `oidc.user.mapping` property. Here's an example of how to map custom properties:\n\n```\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}\n```\n\nReplace `myxproperty1` and `myxproperty2` with the actual XWiki user property names, and `${oidc.user.subject}` with the appropriate variable based on the data provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n\nAfter configuring the mappings, save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart XWiki to apply the changes.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Authentication/ \n\n\nYes, you can customize the user profile fields populated from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. To achieve this, you will need to modify the configuration of the OpenID Connect Authenticator.\n\nHere are the general steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Install the OpenID Connect Authenticator**: Make sure you have the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension installed in your XWiki instance.\n\n2. **Define Custom User Properties**: In your XWiki instance, you can create custom user properties that you want to map to the fields from the OpenID Connect provider.\n\n3. **Update the OIDC Configuration**: \n   - Open the XWiki administration interface.\n   - Navigate to the configuration for the OpenID Connect Authenticator.\n   - You will need to define the mapping between the OpenID Connect provider's user profile fields and the custom user properties in XWiki. This is typically done through the configuration settings of the OIDC authenticator.\n\n4. **Use Object Classes**: If necessary, you can define or modify object classes in XWiki to hold the additional user properties you want to manage. The mapping can be configured using the `XWiki.OIDC.ClientConfigurationClass`.\n\n5. **Testing the Configuration**: After making the necessary configurations, test the authentication process to ensure that the user profile fields are correctly populated from the OpenID Connect provider to the corresponding user properties in XWiki.\n\n6. **Refer to Documentation**: For detailed instructions and specific configuration options, refer to the [OpenID Connect Authenticator documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to customize and map additional user profile fields from your OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties effectively.",
