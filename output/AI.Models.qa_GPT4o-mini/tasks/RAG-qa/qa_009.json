  "expected_answer": "This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/Permission%20types/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/NestedPagesMigration/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application \n\n\nTo deny the \"Script\" right to a space administrator in XWiki, you'll need to modify the access rights for that specific space. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Access the Space Administration**:\n   - Go to the space where you want to deny the script right.\n   - Look for the space administration options, which are typically available in the space's menu.\n\n2. **Edit the Rights**:\n   - Find the section for managing permissions or access rights.\n   - Locate the permission settings for the \"Script\" right.\n\n3. **Set the Permission**:\n   - In the rights table, look for the user or group that corresponds to the space administrator.\n   - Change the setting for the \"Script\" right from \"Allow\" to \"Deny.\"\n\n4. **Save Changes**:\n   - Make sure to save your changes to apply the new permissions.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- The \"Script\" right must be explicitly denied for the space administrator if they already have access through group inheritance or other permissions.\n- Denying rights generally follows the order of priority: explicit deny > allow > no setting.\n- If you need to revoke the script right for multiple administrators or groups, ensure that you check each one accordingly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively deny script execution rights to a space administrator in XWiki.",
