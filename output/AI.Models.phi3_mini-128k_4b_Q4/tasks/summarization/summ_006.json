You can build simple applications, extend the platform with custom plugins, or even build complex Web applications. The Getting Started guide only covers basic use cases for users and admins, however, there are plenty of resources for Developers as well in the documentation. XWiki's powerful programming features are documented in the [Developer's Guide](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/). A number of applications are pre-installed but additional applications, macros and other extensions are available on the [Extensions wiki](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/). The documentation for the [XWiki Rendering](https://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/) has a [dedicated wiki](https://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/).For documentation related to the development of XWiki itself, visit the [XWiki Development Zone](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/). |\n\n**Next: [Step 1 Creating a page](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/CreatingAPage)**\n\n\n",

  "ai_answer": "This guide is divided into three parts based on user roles in XWiki - User, Administrator and Developer. Users are instructed to create a page or edit it after logging in; administrators can change the logo, panels, and manage users along with their rights for better control over content creation within the wiki environment. The guide provides detailed steps on how to perform these tasks including links to further resources like editing history of pages. Developers have access to more advanced features such as building applications or custom plugins using XWiki's powerful programming capabilities, and can refer to extensive documentation available for development-related activities in the Dev Guide along with information about preinstalled apps, extensions, rendering guides, and a dedicated wiki on developer topics within XWiki. The guide encourages users interested in these advanced features or developing their own applications/plugins to visit specific resources provided by XWiki'ner community for further assistance.",
