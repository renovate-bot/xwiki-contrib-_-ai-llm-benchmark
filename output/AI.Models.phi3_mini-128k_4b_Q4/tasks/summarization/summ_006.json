We divided into 3 different parts depending on whether you're a user, an administrator or a developer. Here goes:\n\n\n\n| **If you're a User** | In order to perform the following actions, you may need to log in. Please ask your administrator for your login credentials.

You can build simple applications, extend the platform with custom plugins, or even build complex Web applications. The Getting Started guide only covers basic use cases for users and admins, however, there are plenty of resources for Developers as well in the documentation. XWiki's powerful programming features are documented in the [Developer's Guide](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/DevGuide/). A number of applications are pre-installed but additional applications, macros and other extensions are available on the [Extensions wiki](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/). The documentation for the [XWiki Rendering](https://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/) has a [dedicated wiki](https://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/).For documentation related to the development of XWiki itself, visit the [XWiki Development Zone](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/). |\n\n**Next: [Step 1 Creating a page](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/CreatingAPage)**\n\n\n",

  "ai_answer": "When starting with XWiki, whether you're an administrator or developer, there are several tasks to consider:\n\nFor **Users**: To begin using and managing a wiki on XWiki, start by creating content. You can create pages like any other user through the 'Creating a page' section of their documentation. If needed for access control purposes you may also want to learn how to manage users as detailed in [creating new users](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/CreatingNewUsers). Additionally, page history can be maintained and managed through the 'Page History' guide for tracking changes made to pages over time which is explained in detail [here](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/PageHistory).\n\nFor **Administrators**: As an administrator, you can customize the visual identity of your wiki with a new logo or modify page layouts by following instructions in [Changing the Logo and Panels](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted/ChangingTheLogoAndThePanels). Furthermore, setting up user rights is essential to ensure a secure environment for your community by using [Setting User Rights](/documentation/userguide/Administration/ManagingUsers) guidelines.\n\nFor **Developers**: XWiki offers robust features that allow you not only as an administrator but also developers to extend the platform with custom plugins and even build complex web applications, thanks in part due to its [Powerful Programming Features](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/GettingStarted). Dive into XWiki's developer resources like the Developer's Guide for an extensive understanding of these capabilities, and explore a range of pre-installed applications or create your own with support from [Extensions wiki](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/). Additionally, you can enhance how content is rendered on pages by exploring XWiki Rendering documentation at [XWiki's rendering guide](https://rendering.xwiki.org/xwiki/) or the dedicated section in their wiki for more information and examples. To understand what lies beneath your customizations, visit the [Development Zone](https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/).\n\n**Next Steps: Step 1 Creating a Page**\n\n",
