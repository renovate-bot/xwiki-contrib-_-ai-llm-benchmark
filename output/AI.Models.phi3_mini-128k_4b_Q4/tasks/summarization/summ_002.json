A very important detail is that the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page. Also, having administration rights imply the view, comment, edit and delete permissions with the added ability to permanently delete a page from the recycle bin.\n\n* Availability:\n\t+ page (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete rights)\n\t+ Wiki (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete, register)\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki > page\n\n## Programming Right\n\nA programmer is allowed to execute arbitrary Java code in the wiki, so any page which was last saved by an user with programmer rights can run dangerous scripts. Because it affects the entire wiki (or wiki farm), programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page in a single wiki environment or from the main wiki in a multi-wiki environment.\n\n* Availability: Main wiki level (automatically implies \u00a0LOGIN, VIEW, EDIT, DELETE, REGISTER, COMMENT, SCRIPT, ADMIN, see the documentation for the [security module](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module))\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki\n\n## Register Right\n\nThe register right is usually granted or revoked for the non-registered pseudo-user \"XWiki.XWikiGuest\".

So, unless an administrator explicitly revokes the right for some users or groups, they will be able to execute the scripts they wrote.\n\nXWiki 14.10+ The script right gives a lot of power to users so by default the right is not given anymore to all users at the main wiki level: administrators have to manually allow it.\n\n* Availability: Page and Wiki level.\n* Default status:\n\t+ ALLOWED on the main wiki\n\t+ DENIED on sub-wikis\n* Priority order: deny > allow > no setting\n* Checking order: page > wiki\n\n# Tabular view\n\n\n\n| Right | Description | Default 1) | Priority 2) | Order | Remarks |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **View** | The view right gives the user the ability to view a document or load it using the API. | Allow | deny >allow >no setting | page > wiki |  |\n| **Comment** | The comment gives the user the ability to add a comment, but not to edit or delete it. | Allow | deny >allow >no setting | page > wiki | In order to be able to edit or delete your own comments, you need to have edit rights on the \u00a0page.

  "ai_answer": "Given the permissions system described above for a Wiki platform like XWiki:\n\n1) If an administrator grants \"Deny\" rights to non-administrators on sub-wikis, how will that impact their ability to comment or edit pages? Assume you are given access as both an admin and regular user. Explain the potential implications with respect to wiki content integrity and collaboration among users from different levels of privilege within this system's permissions hierarchy.\n\n2) In a multi-wiki environment, can non-administrators be granted \"Programming\" rights on sub-wikis? If not possible as per current policy outlined in the table above, could it ever make sense to allow such privileges and under what circumstances might an administrator consider doing this exceptionally for specific pages or articles within a wiki where certain users need temporary access due to their expertise in content development but lack broader permissions like \"Administration\"?\n\n3) Considering that the default setting grants all members of non-registered pseudo-users such as XWiki.XWikiGuest editing capabilities, what are some potential risks and benefits associated with this policy? Additionally, could there be an alternative approach to manage access for guest users without compromising security while still promoting collaborative work among various user levels in the platform?\n\n4) Explain how inheritance of rights works within a wiki system based on your understanding from the table. If you are creating several sub-wikis under one main wiki, describe an example scenario where \"Allow\" permissions would cascade down to all child pages and objects but not upwards (from page level to parent), using specific examples like granting access rights for a company's project documentation or policy manual that includes various levels of confidentiality.\n\n5) Given the information above, design an additional permission setting named \"Audit\" with its default settings as follows: Deny on sub-wikis and Allow at wiki level only in combination with explicit permissions granted to individuals who have been part of a committee reviewing sensitive content wherein they need access but not full editing rights. Explain the rationale behind this setting, considering security concerns while balancing user collaboration needs for such documents/pages within your proposed Wiki environment's permission system framework.\n\n6) Based on XWiki\u2019s Security Module documentation and the given permissions table: \n- What might be a potential drawback if an administrator mistakenly grants \"Deny\" access to non-administrators at sub-wiki level, but not for specific pages/articles? Explain how this could affect content integrity.\n- How would you correct or mitigate the issue without revoking rights and maintaining collaborative work flow among users of varying privilege levels on a multi-wiki environment with multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish)? Consider wiki structure as \"Company X\", which has different sub-wikis for each department like HR, Tech Support, Sales & Marketing etc.\n",
