A very important detail is that the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page. Also, having administration rights imply the view, comment, edit and delete permissions with the added ability to permanently delete a page from the recycle bin.\n\n* Availability:\n\t+ page (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete rights)\n\t+ Wiki (Automatically includes the view, comment, edit, delete, register)\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki > page\n\n## Programming Right\n\nA programmer is allowed to execute arbitrary Java code in the wiki, so any page which was last saved by an user with programmer rights can run dangerous scripts. Because it affects the entire wiki (or wiki farm), programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page in a single wiki environment or from the main wiki in a multi-wiki environment.\n\n* Availability: Main wiki level (automatically implies \u00a0LOGIN, VIEW, EDIT, DELETE, REGISTER, COMMENT, SCRIPT, ADMIN, see the documentation for the [security module](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module))\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki\n\n## Register Right\n\nThe register right is usually granted or revoked for the non-registered pseudo-user \"XWiki.XWikiGuest\". This permission can only be set from the wiki preferences page.\n\n* Availability: Wiki level\n* Default status: ALLOWED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki\n\n## Create Wikis Right\n\nThe \"createwiki\" right can only be granted via the main wiki, just like programming rights. .\n\n* Availability: Main wiki level\n* Default status: DENIED\n* Priority order: allow > deny > no setting\n* Checking order: wiki\n\n## Script Right\n\nThe \"Script\" right was introduced in version 7.2 in order to control who has the right to write scripts. Anyone with edit rights can write a script in a wiki page. However, when the page is rendered, the script will only execute if the last author of the page has the \"Script\" right.\n\nXWiki <14.10 For backward-compatibility reasons, the standard XWiki distribution comes with the \"Script\" right being allowed for all users at the main wiki level. So, unless an administrator explicitly revokes the right for some users or groups, they will be able to execute the scripts they wrote.\n\nXWiki 14.10+ The script right gives a lot of power to users so by default the right is not given anymore to all users at the main wiki level: administrators have to manually allow it.\n\n* Availability: Page and Wiki level.\n* Default status:\n\t+ ALLOWED on the main wiki\n\t+ DENIED on sub-wikis\n* Priority order: deny > allow > no setting\n* Checking order: page > wiki\n\n# Tabular view\n\n\n\n| Right | Description | Default 1) | Priority 2) | Order | Remarks |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **View** | The view right gives the user the ability to view a document or load it using the API. | Allow | deny >allow >no setting | page > wiki |  |\n| **Comment** | The comment gives the user the ability to add a comment, but not to edit or delete it. | Allow | deny >allow >no setting | page > wiki | In order to be able to edit or delete your own comments, you need to have edit rights on the \u00a0page.

  "ai_answer": "The XWiki documentation provides detailed guidance on access permissions for various user actions within the platform:\n\n- **View Right** allows users to view documents or load them using an API, with a default status of allowed and priority set at deny. Users can only see content if they have this permission unless it's explicitly granted otherwise.\n  \n- **Comment Right** enables adding comments but not editing/deleting; the right is also by default allowed, following the same prioritization as view rights. Edit permissions are required to modify one\u2019s own or others' comments. \n\n- **Edit Right** permits full page and object edits with an allow status being its default setting. It has a higher priority than deny settings but is less restrictive compared to the administration right, which also includes viewing rights by default for administrators in XWiki environments.\n  \n- **Delete Right** allows moving pages into a recycle bin and comes with a denied status as standard unless one holds creation or administrative privileges; it has priority over allow settings but is less restrictive than deny configurations, allowing users to restore items from the recycle bin if needed. \n\nSpecial permissions include:\n\n- **Administration Right** grants extensive control including viewing and editing rights by default at both page and wiki levels as well as deletion capabilities; it's denied unless explicitly granted but comes with an allow setting for administrators, which is crucial since they cannot be restricted in their administrative actions. \n  \n- **Programming Right** allows running Java code within the wiki pages or farm environment, and this right requires login access by default as well; it's denied unless explicitly granted from specific preference settings with an allow setting taking precedence over deny configurations for security reasons. It is available at both main and sub-wiki levels but has a different priority order compared to administration rights (allow > deny).\n  \n- **Register Right** pertains to the pseudo-user \"XWiki.XWikiGuest\" with an allow setting as its default, granting access only from wiki preferences pages; it's essential for guest users and has a lower priority than administration rights (page > wiki).\n  \n- **Create Wikis Right** is exclusive to main wikis but comes with denied settings by default. It grants the ability to create new subwikis, following page level prioritization rules over wiki levels for this permission type. \n\nLastly:\n\n- The \"Script\" right allows script writing within a Wiki and is conditional based on who last edited the content; it's available at both main and page/wiki levels but comes with an allow setting by default, unlike older versions where all users had access to this permission. It has priority over deny settings for those granted edit rights in XWiki 7.2 or later iterations of the software.\n  \nThe table summarizes these permissions across different priorities and checking orders while noting that explicit \"deny\" takes precedence, allowing configurations can override implicit restrictions based on an allow setting being set first.",
