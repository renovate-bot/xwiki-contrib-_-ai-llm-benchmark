  "prompt": "Adapt the following text to a younger audience (age 8-10):\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the plant's activities.",
  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Imagine photosynthesis like magic trick inside leaves of many green things you see in your surroundings, such as trees and grasses! When they face up towards warm, yellowish light from our big sun (don\u2019t forget about not too hot or cold), these amazing plants change the Sun's energy into a special kind that helps them grow bigger with new leaves, roots. They even make oxygen which is what we breathe in! It\u2019s like they have their very own green power stations inside of them called chlorophyll (a fancy name for 'green stuff').",
