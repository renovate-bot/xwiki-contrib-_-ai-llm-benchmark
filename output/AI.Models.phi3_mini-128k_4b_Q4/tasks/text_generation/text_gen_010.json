  "prompt": "Adapt the following text to a more technical audience:\n\nThe human brain is a complex organ that controls all functions of the body, interprets information from the outside world, and embodies the essence of the mind and soul.",
  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "In biological terms, the cerebrum or central processing unit governs bodily operations by orchestrating both voluntary and involuntary actions while simultaneously acting as a conduit for sensory data assimilation from external stimuli - essentially serving as an encephaloic mediator between internal physiology and environmental interaction. It encapsulates the cognitive processes representative of consciousness, facilitating intricate thought patterns that underpin identity formation through neurocognitive activities such as perception analysis, memory recall retrieval, emotional responses, decision-making mechanisms, learning protocols, language comprehension and linguistic processing. The cerebral structure is akin to an elaborate network of neural networks interconnected by synaptic pathways facilitating electrical impulse transmission via neurochemical signaling - essential for these functions that characterize individuality within Homo sapiens' uniqueness, encapsulating the essence often associated with mind and soul.",
