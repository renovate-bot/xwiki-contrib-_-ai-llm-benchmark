  "ai_answer": "Beneath the canopy' endless azure sky, where whispers do not betray,  \nThe whispering leaves converse in hushed tones on high;   \nA symphony that paints its colors bold and bright - it sighs with grace upon my face.    \nNature\u2019s canvas breathes life into the heart of mine eyes so wide, where dreams hold no bounds or trace.  \nForests deep green embrace me in their arms as I roam through verdant lace;   \nThe skyline kissed by sunbeams play and cast a golden gleaming grace upon her face.    \nCascading waterfalls whisper tales of ancient love, where time is but an echo from afar -  \nA lullaby in every drop that falls with gentle touch on earthen floor beneath the trees so tall;   \nInfinite oceans hum tunes as they lazily roll and round.    \nBeneath my feet I find their rhythm, crisp leaves rustle stories untold of times when nature reigned supreme -  \nAnd for a moment in time, all is known to me without fear or dread;   \nA harmony profound where life\u2019s essence unfolds and ends.    \nHere the beauty resides that I seek with every breath astounds my soul divine \u2013 so pure!",
