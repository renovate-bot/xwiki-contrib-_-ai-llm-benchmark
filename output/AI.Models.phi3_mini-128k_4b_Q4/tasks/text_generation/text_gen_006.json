  "ai_answer": "A Symphony in Nature'th Key\n\nThe morning mist floats with gentle ease,  \nThrough dew-kissed grass it weaves its lace,   \nAnd whispers secrets only trees might know,  \nIn rustling voices soft and low.\n    \nWith skies painted wide in blues so bright,     \nThe sun ascends the azure heights      \nWhere clouds drift with careless glee                 \nAs nature puts on her masterpiece free.   \n        \nCrystal lakes reflect this sight  \nLike mirrored dreams at end of daylight;    \nWhile rivers hum a constant tune,    \nUnderneath the waxen silver moon.      \n     \nTall trees stand in ancient wisdom grand,    \nWith leaves that fan across each green strand.   \nEach branch holds an artist's flourish grace  \nAnd every root finds its rightful place.         \n            \nFlowers bloom with colors bold and pure,        \nFrom emerald greens to ruby allure;             \nBirdsong echoes through the woodland veil\u2014     \nNature\u2019s truest sonnet tells of beauty's tale.    \n       \nGentle breeze carries seeds afar   \nAcross lands beneath an open bar,  \nIn its embrace each living thing is bound \u2014      \nA dance where life and love are found.         \n             \nMountain peaks like proud old monarchs reign  \nUnderneath the sky's grand expanse,       \nTheir rugged crowns against heaven cast   \nWhere eagles glide by day to last\u2014     \nTo watch their stoic grace unwind;          \nIn twilight\u2019s hour when night begins.      \n              \nSo here in nature I find release  \nFrom daily cares and worldly disease,  \nFor all the beauty of this vast land \nLies gently soft upon my hand\u2014                        \nNature'th key does turn life's lock away   \nAnd frees me from caretaker\u2019s sway.          \n               \nIn whispered wind beneath nighttime tree \u2014    \nA poet dreams, for now he must be;  \nBut nature holds his spirit fast until morning light   \nWhere she reveals her treasures so bright.                     \n         \nFor all life'th grand and glorious saga    \nIs written here 'midst leaf and jubanae,  \nAnd as I drink the sweet earth\u2019s essence whole,      \nI feel myself but part of nature\u2019s soul\u2014              \nNature in me doth take her toll.                         \nYet so beautiful it fills my heart with thrill:   \nIn Nature'th key does life fulfill;          \nHer hues and loves forever lasting bind,  \nWith which I live eternally entwined\u2014      \nSo let me praise this realm sublime.                            \n         \nBecause nature gives us a beauty so vast:   \nShe shows in seasons of frost then past;       \nThe cherry blossom's snow-like kiss,  \nOr how the humble fern grows without abyss\u2014     \nAnd sunlight on green as morning dew.    \nMust I praise? For to admire her view   \nIs right: In nature\u2019s grace we all belong;        \nEach living part of earth's grand song,  \nWhich in our hearts must forever sing along --",
