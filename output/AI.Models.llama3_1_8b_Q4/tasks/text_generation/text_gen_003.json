  "ai_answer": "Here's a version of the text that's more suitable for an 8-10 year old:\n\n\"You know how you need food to give you energy to run around and play? Well, plants are kind of like you, but instead of eating sandwiches or pizza, they use sunlight to make their own food! This process is called photosynthesis. Plants spread out their leaves to catch the sun's rays, and with the help of some water and air, they turn that sunlight into a type of fuel that helps them grow strong and healthy!\"",
