  "prompt": "Adapt the following text to a younger audience (age 8-10):\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the plant's activities.",
  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Here's an adapted version of the text for kids aged 8-10:\n\n\"Hey kids! Do you know how plants grow and stay alive? Well, it's because they have a superpower called photosynthesis! This magic process helps plants turn sunlight into food that gives them energy to do things like grow big and strong.\n\nJust like how we need to eat breakfast to give us energy for the day, plants use sunlight as their \"breakfast\" to help them survive. It's like having a built-in power source right in their leaves! And guess what? We all get to benefit from this amazing process too - because without healthy plants making oxygen through photosynthesis, we wouldn't be able to breathe easily!\"",
