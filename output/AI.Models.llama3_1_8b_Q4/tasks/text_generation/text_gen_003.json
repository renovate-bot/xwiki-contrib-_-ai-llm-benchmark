  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Here's a version of the text that's more suitable for kids aged 8-10:\n\n\"You know how you need to eat food to have energy to play and have fun? Well, plants are kind of like us, but instead of eating food, they make their own! This magic process is called photosynthesis (say \"pho-to-sin-the-sis\").\n\nWhen sunlight shines on a plant's leaves, it gives the plant the energy it needs to grow big and strong. It's like a special power-up that helps the plant do all its important jobs, like making food for itself and even helping other living things in the garden.\"",
