  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "Here's a revised version of the text targeted at a more technical audience:\n\nThe mammalian cerebral cortex, comprising approximately 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, serves as the primary integrative hub for various bodily functions, including motor control, sensory perception, and cognitive processes. This complex neural organ processes information from external stimuli through intricate networks of excitatory and inhibitory interconnections, facilitating adaptive responses to environmental cues. The resultant neural activity embodies the essential characteristics of consciousness, self-awareness, and cognition, which collectively underlie an individual's mental and spiritual experiences.",
