  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "Here's an adapted version for a more technical audience:\n\nThe human cerebral cortex is a highly integrated and intricate neural structure that serves as the central processing unit (CPU) for the entire organism, mediating all physiological responses and integrating sensory information from the external environment via afferent inputs. It embodies the fundamental characteristics of cognitive function, encompassing the integration of mental processes and spiritual experiences.\n\nNote: I've used technical terms such as \"cerebral cortex\", \"afferent inputs\", \"central processing unit (CPU)\", and \"physiological responses\" to make the text more suitable for a technical audience.",
