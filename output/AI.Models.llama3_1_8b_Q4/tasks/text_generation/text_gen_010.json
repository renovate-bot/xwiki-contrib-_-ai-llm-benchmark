  "prompt": "Adapt the following text to a more technical audience:\n\nThe human brain is a complex organ that controls all functions of the body, interprets information from the outside world, and embodies the essence of the mind and soul.",
  "expected_answer": "The human brain is a highly intricate and sophisticated organ responsible for regulating and coordinating various physiological processes, processing and interpreting sensory information from the external environment, and serving as the biological substrate for cognitive functions, consciousness, and subjective experiences.",
  "ai_answer": "Here's a revised version of the text with a more technical tone:\n\nThe human cerebral cortex is a highly intricate and dynamic neural network, comprising approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which collectively governs the physiological response to various stimuli, integrates sensory information from the external environment, and embodies the cognitive, emotional, and volitional aspects of consciousness.\n\nNote that I've made the following changes:\n\n* \"Human brain\" is now referred to as \"human cerebral cortex\", which is a more specific and technical term.\n* The phrase \"controls all functions of the body\" has been rephrased to \"governs the physiological response to various stimuli\", which conveys a sense of neuromodulation and systemic regulation.\n* \"Interprets information from the outside world\" has become \"integrates sensory information from the external environment\", which highlights the neural processing aspects of perception and cognition.\n* The final phrase, \"embodies the essence of the mind and soul\", has been reworded to \"embodies the cognitive, emotional, and volitional aspects of consciousness\", which is a more technical and neuroscientific way of describing complex mental states.",
