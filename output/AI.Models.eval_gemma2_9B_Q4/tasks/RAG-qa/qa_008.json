  "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5. Repeat for each (sub)wiki for which you need to set this configuration!",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Attachments \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Attachment/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Attachments \n\n\nHere's how you can configure XWiki to allow only images or PDF files, up to 10MB in size, as attachments across your entire wiki:\n\n1. **Maximum Upload Size:**\n\n   - Go to the XWiki administration page: `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n   - Find the field \"Maximum Upload Size\" and change the value to 10,485,760 bytes (10MB). This limits the maximum file size for all uploads.\n\n2. **Mimetype Restrictions:**\n\n   - Navigate to the \"Attachments Restriction\" section in the XWiki administration UI.\n   - In the \"Blocked Mimetypes\" field, enter the following:\n     `image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif,application/pdf`\n     - This will allow only these file types to be uploaded.\n\n   - Save your changes.\n\n\nRemember that these settings apply to the entire wiki. If you need different restrictions for specific spaces or pages, you'll need to adjust the settings at those levels as well. \n\n\n",
