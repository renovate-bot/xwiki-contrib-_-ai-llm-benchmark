      "content": "Therefore, the real task of settling access decisions is entirely delegated to customizable components that may be introduce by third parties and configured without rebuilding the platform. The component hint of the AuthorizationSettler may be configured from the ConfigurationSource (xwiki.properties) using the key security.authorization.settler. The default hint &quot;default&quot; is implemented by the DefaultAuthorizationSettler. Another experimental PriorityAuthorizationSettler (currently unmaintained, use at your own risk) is also bundled. Both are based on a AbstractAuthorizationSettler which provide a common foundation for merging access provide at each hierarchy level based on a customizable dynamic policy.\n\n### Right definitions\n\nSince the settling process is delegated to the AuthorizationSettler, the interpretation of right definitions is up to it, and right definition is only a tool for helping the creation of an expandable authorization settler, allowing new rights to be easily externally defined. New Right maybe registered with the AuthorizationManager using a RightDescription. The meaning of the right definition explained here is mostly pertinent for the default implementation of the AuthorizationSettler, and should normally be followed by any other settler implementation, but this could not be guaranteed.\n\n",

      "content": "Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to use the new checkAccess() method everywhere you check an access before action. And you should refrain to catch the resulting exception, this should be done at higher level, by the UI which will therefore be able to centralize all access check violations. (Obviously this is a work in progress that we are starting now and will only properly work when the full migration of the old service is completed). Also note that, access violation done during checkAccess() are logged. In most situation, this should not happen, since the UI, or earlier code have already checked the possibility for access, and does not provide a path to the prohibited action. Remember also, that checking the same access several time is no more cost full, so checking access very near the action (even if you think there is no reason it would be denied) is good security measure to prevent security bugs. This is clearly the purpose of the checkAccess() method.\n\n## Some definitions as seen by this module\n\n",
