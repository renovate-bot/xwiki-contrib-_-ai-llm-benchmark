  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nIt sounds like you're getting too many notifications in XWiki! Here's how to disable them:\n\n1. **Go to your Notifications Preferences:** Look for a link or menu option related to \"Notifications\" or \"Preferences\" in your XWiki interface.\n\n2. **Find the \"Filters\" Section:**  Within your notification preferences, you should see a section dedicated to filters.\n\n3. **Review and Disable Filters:**\n\n   * **System Filters:** These are pre-defined filters that might be enabled by default. You can usually toggle them on or off.\n\n   * **Custom Filters:** These are filters you've likely created or that were automatically generated when you watched certain pages.  Look for filters related to the pages or types of content you don't want notifications about. You can disable or delete them.\n\n4. **\"Unwatch\" Pages:** If you're getting notifications about specific pages you're no longer interested in, consider \"unwatching\" them. This will remove the automatic filter associated with that page.\n\n5. **Notification Formats:**  Within your notification preferences, you can also control the formats in which you receive notifications (e.g., email, alerts). Disable the formats you don't want.\n\n\nLet me know if you have trouble finding these settings in your XWiki instance. \n",

So the watch buttons might be in an undecided state if there&#x27;s an existing filter targeting the same location, but only some specific events, or some specific format. The idea is to inform the user that there&#x27;s already a filter for this location and that using the watch buttons might impact the filter.\u00a0\n\nIf a filter is not targeting all event types and all formats, and is actually in contradiction with the filter that would be created by the watch button, then this filter will be automatically disabled when using the watch button. For example, if a user had a filter to ignore all mentions on a space, then watching that exact same space will automatically disable that filter. The user can always review their filters and enable them back.\n\n![notification-watch-undecided.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-watch-undecided.png?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\nXWiki 16.3.0+\u00a0The custom filters are all displayed in a live data which can now be filtered and sorted out:\u00a0\n\n![notification-custom-filters-livedata.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata.png?rev=1.1)  \n![notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\n",
