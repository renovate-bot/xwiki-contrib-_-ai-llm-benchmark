  "expected_answer": "This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI \n\n\n\n\nBased on the provided search results, it appears that the XWiki Security Module is responsible for managing access rights. To deny script right to a space administrator, you would need to use the `checkAccess()` method or `hasAccess()` method provided by the Security Module.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the `hasAccess()` method to check if a user has script right on a specific space:\n\n```java\n#if ($services.security.authorization.hasAccess('script', 'xwiki:SpaceName'))\n  ... show some UI that require script access on the SpaceName space by the current user ...\n#end\n```\n\nTo deny script right to a space administrator, you would need to override the default rights of the space administrator. However, the provided search results do not provide information on how to do this.\n\nIt is recommended to check the XWiki documentation for more information on how to manage access rights and override default rights. Additionally, you can also try searching for more specific information on denying script right to a space administrator in the XWiki documentation or community forums.\n\n**Note:** The provided search results are related to XWiki's RESTful API and Security Module, but they do not provide a direct answer to the question. The answer is based on general knowledge and may not be accurate.",

      "content": "Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to use the new checkAccess() method everywhere you check an access before action. And you should refrain to catch the resulting exception, this should be done at higher level, by the UI which will therefore be able to centralize all access check violations. (Obviously this is a work in progress that we are starting now and will only properly work when the full migration of the old service is completed). Also note that, access violation done during checkAccess() are logged. In most situation, this should not happen, since the UI, or earlier code have already checked the possibility for access, and does not provide a path to the prohibited action. Remember also, that checking the same access several time is no more cost full, so checking access very near the action (even if you think there is no reason it would be denied) is good security measure to prevent security bugs. This is clearly the purpose of the checkAccess() method.\n\n## Some definitions as seen by this module\n\n",

While hasAccess() method will simply provide true/false answer, the checkAccess() method does not need any return value check, since it will throw an AccessDeniedException if the resulting access has been denied.\n\nIn the old right service, there were no distinction between access check for UI purposes, and access check for really proceeding to action. Only the hasAccess() method was provided. Missing this distinction is not good because:\n\n* it does not allow easily finding all critical security access check points where access is checked for ensuring security.\n* it leave the responsibility of properly checking return values by the caller at these security check point.\n* it leave the burden of managing access denied situation individually in all those security check points by the caller.\n\n",
