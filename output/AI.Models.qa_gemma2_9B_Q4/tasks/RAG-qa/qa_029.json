  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/Permission%20types/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nYou can't directly refuse the \"Script Right\" to an administrator of a space in XWiki. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Administrator Privileges:** Space administrators have inherent, broad permissions within their space. These permissions are designed to allow them to manage and control the space effectively. \n* **Script Right's Scope:** The \"Script Right\" is a powerful right that allows users to execute XWiki scripts. It's often granted to administrators because scripts are often used for tasks like automation, customization, and data manipulation within a space.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n\n1. **Review Script Usage:** Instead of outright denying the \"Script Right,\" consider carefully reviewing the scripts that administrators are running within the space. You can:\n   * Implement script review processes to ensure scripts are safe and appropriate.\n   * Set up logging to track script executions for auditing purposes.\n2. **Restrict Script Capabilities:**  \n   * You can explore using XWiki's security features to limit the scope of scripts. For example, you could:\n      * Define specific permissions for different types of scripts.\n      * Use sandboxing techniques to isolate scripts from sensitive data.\n3. **Granular Permissions:** If possible, explore using more granular permission levels within XWiki that allow you to control specific script actions rather than granting or denying the \"Script Right\" entirely.\n\n\nRemember that completely restricting the \"Script Right\" for administrators could hinder their ability to manage the space effectively.  Strive for a balance between security and functionality.",

      "content": "### Default right settler additional policies\n\nThe default right settler provide the following additional rules during it decision process:\n\n* A *right* allowed by a rule matching the *user* could not be denied by another rule at the same *level* matching a *group* containing that *user*, whatever is the tie resolution policy. For example, on the same document, a *Rule* allowing edit right to userA of groupA, and a *Rule* denying edit right to groupA enter in conflict. The normal tie resolution policy (which is, for the edit right, to deny access) will apply to any user of groupA while userA will be allowed.\n* Any *rule* matching both the *user* and a group containing the *user* will be considered as a *rule* matched for the *user* and will be implied as so in the above rule.\n* Implied right receive the tie resolution policy, the inheritance override policy, and their kind of matching (user or group) from the right and the rule of the right that have implied them. For example, an edit right implied by an admin right will not be overridden by a denial of the edit right at a lower level.\n* Implied right does not imply other rights. Implied rights are not recursively applied. This could be seen as a limitation, but this is more a feature, since this is not difficult to provide the cumulative list of implied right during right definition if this is really the wanted behavior.\n* When a right has been allowed at a given level, it get explicitly denied to anyone else at the same level. For example, if edit right is allow at document level to userA only, it will be denied to any other userB, unless this userB receive an implied edit right with a different inheritance policy at a higher level (userB is admin for example).\n\n",
