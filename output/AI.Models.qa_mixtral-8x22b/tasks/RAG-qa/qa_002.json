  "prompt": "Why am I not receiving any notifications in XWiki.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Notifications \n\n\nThere are a few reasons why you might not be receiving notifications in XWiki. Here are some things to check:\n\n1. **Notifications are enabled**: Make sure that notifications are enabled on the platform. You can check this by going to the XWiki.properties file and ensuring that the variable \"notifications.enabled\" is set to true.\n2. **Email notifications are enabled**: If you're expecting to receive email notifications, you should also ensure that this feature is enabled. You can check this by going to the XWiki.properties file and ensuring that the variable \"notifications.emails.enabled\" is set to true.\n3. **Live email notifications grace time**: If you're not receiving live email notifications, it could be because of the grace time setting. The grace time defines the period (in minutes) for which the platform should wait before sending a notification mail after an event. You can check this setting by going to the XWiki.properties file and looking for the variable \"notifications.emails.live.graceTime\".\n4. **No notifications to receive**: It's possible that there are simply no notifications for you to receive. You can check this by going to the Notifications application in the top bar, under the Alert entry (represented by a bell).\n5. **Filters enabled**: By default, you won't receive notifications for actions done by yourself. If you want to receive notifications for your own actions, you can switch off the Own event filter in the Notifications application.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, please contact XWiki support for further assistance.",
