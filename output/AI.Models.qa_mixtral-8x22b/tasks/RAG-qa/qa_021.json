  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nIt seems that the issue you're facing is related to the unavailability of the notification bell icon in the top right corner, even after installing the \"Notification d'alerte\" extension.\n\nBased on the provided search results, it appears that the notification bell icon is a part of the \"Notifications Application\". However, there's no direct solution provided for the issue you're facing.\n\nHere are a few suggestions you can try:\n\n1. Ensure that the \"Notifications Application\" is installed and enabled on your XWiki instance. You can check this in the Extension Manager under the \"Installed\" tab.\n\n2. Check if the user role or profile settings have any restrictions that might prevent the notification bell icon from appearing.\n\n3. If you're using a custom theme or skin, make sure it includes the notification bell icon and its functionality.\n\n4. Clear the browser cache and reload the page to see if the issue persists.\n\nIf none of these suggestions work, I recommend reaching out to the XWiki community or support for further assistance.",

So the watch buttons might be in an undecided state if there&#x27;s an existing filter targeting the same location, but only some specific events, or some specific format. The idea is to inform the user that there&#x27;s already a filter for this location and that using the watch buttons might impact the filter.\u00a0\n\nIf a filter is not targeting all event types and all formats, and is actually in contradiction with the filter that would be created by the watch button, then this filter will be automatically disabled when using the watch button. For example, if a user had a filter to ignore all mentions on a space, then watching that exact same space will automatically disable that filter. The user can always review their filters and enable them back.\n\n![notification-watch-undecided.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-watch-undecided.png?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\nXWiki 16.3.0+\u00a0The custom filters are all displayed in a live data which can now be filtered and sorted out:\u00a0\n\n![notification-custom-filters-livedata.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata.png?rev=1.1)  \n![notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\n",
