  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that the issue you're facing is not directly addressed. However, I can still provide some general guidance based on the context of the information.\n\nThe bell icon you mentioned is typically associated with the Notifications feature of XWiki. According to the information, the Notifications feature is provided by the Notifications Application and not the Alert Notification extension. Therefore, if the bell icon is not available, it might be due to the Notifications Application not being installed or not functioning properly.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. **Check if the Notifications Application is installed**: You can do this by going to the Administration page and looking for the Notifications Application in the installed extensions list.\n\n2. **Try reinstalling the Notifications Application**: If it's already installed, you might want to try reinstalling it to see if that resolves the issue. You can use the Extension Manager or the manual method. Remember to install all dependent Extensions if they are not already installed in your wiki.\n\n3. **Check for conflicts**: If you have other extensions installed, they might be conflicting with the Notifications Application. Try disabling other extensions one by one to see if the bell icon becomes available.\n\n4. **Check for permissions**: Ensure that you are logged in with a user who has the necessary permissions to view and receive notifications.\n\n5. **Check the version of XWiki**: Make sure your version of XWiki supports the Notifications Application. Older versions might not have the Extension Manager or might not support the Notifications Application.\n\nIf none of these steps work, you might want to seek further help from the XWiki community or the support team. They might be able to provide more specific guidance based on your exact setup and situation.\n\nPlease note that these steps are based on the information provided and your specific situation might require a different approach. Always make sure to backup your data before making any major changes.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

This feed can be accessed either through a link in your notification tray (or at the bottom of the notifications macro).\n\n![NotificationTrayRSSLink.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotificationTrayRSSLink.png?rev=1.3)  \n![NotificationsWithRSS.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotificationsWithRSS.png?rev=1.3)\n\n## Notifications Macro\n\nThe [Notifications Macro is provided by its own application](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Macro/).\n\n# Settings\n\nOn the notifications menu, you also have a link to go to the &quot;settings&quot; of the notifications.\n\n![notif4.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notif4.png?rev=1.8)\n\nBy default, users only get notifications when they are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated. For receiving other notifications, you need to select which &quot;types&quot; of notifications you want to receive. When a page is created? When a blog post is published?\n\nYou can enable or disable all notification types that belong to a particular application by clicking on the bells associated to this application. If some types are enabled and other are disabled inside an application, the switch looks like the next screenshot, meaning that the application&#x27;s notifications are partially enabled:\n\n![NotifUndeterminate.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifUndeterminate.png?rev=1.3)\n\nNote that you only receive notifications that occur after you turn on the notifications types.\n\n",

You can get more informations about this feature in the [Notifications API documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Module/#HCreatecustomnotificationtemplates).\n\n# Prerequisites &amp; Installation Instructions\n\nWe recommend using the [Extension Manager](http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Extension+Manager+Application) to install this extension (Make sure that the text &quot;Installable with the Extension Manager&quot; is displayed at the top right location on this page to know if this extension can be installed with the Extension Manager). Note that installing Extensions when being offline is currently not supported and you&#x27;d need to use some [complex manual method](https://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/#HOthermethods).\n\nYou can also use the following manual method, which is useful if this extension cannot be installed with the Extension Manager or if you&#x27;re using an old version of XWiki that doesn&#x27;t have the Extension Manager:\n\n1. Log in the wiki with a user having Administration rights\n2. Go to the Administration page and select the Import category\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload the downloaded XAR\n4. Click on the uploaded XAR and follow the instructions\n5. You&#x27;ll also need to install all [dependent Extensions](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HDependencies) that are not already installed in your wiki\n\n",
