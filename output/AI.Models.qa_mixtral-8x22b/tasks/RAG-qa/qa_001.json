  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIt seems that the issue might be related to the configuration or installation of the Notifications Application in XWiki. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the installation**: Make sure that the Notifications Application is properly installed in your XWiki instance. You can use the Extension Manager to install it, or you can manually install it by following the instructions provided in the documentation.\n\n2. **Check the configuration**: Ensure that the Notifications Application is enabled in your XWiki configuration. You can do this by checking the `xwiki.properties` file and making sure that the `notifications.enabled` property is set to `true`.\n\n3. **Check the theme**: If you are using a custom theme, it might not include the bell icon for notifications. In this case, you would need to add the bell icon to your theme.\n\n4. **Clear the cache**: Sometimes, the issue might be caused by a cached version of the page that doesn't include the bell icon. Try clearing your XWiki cache and see if the issue persists.\n\nIf you have tried all these steps and the issue still persists, I would recommend reaching out to the XWiki community for further assistance. You can do this by posting your issue on the XWiki forums or by contacting the XWiki support team.",

For receiving other notifications, you need to select which &quot;types&quot; of notifications you want to receive. When a page is created? When a blog post is published?\n\nYou can enable or disable all notification types that belong to a particular application by clicking on the bells associated to this application. If some types are enabled and other are disabled inside an application, the switch looks like the next screenshot, meaning that the application&#x27;s notifications are partially enabled:\n\n![NotifUndeterminate.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifUndeterminate.png?rev=1.3)\n\nNote that you only receive notifications that occur after you turn on the notifications types.\n\n",

Note that installing Extensions when being offline is currently not supported and you&#x27;d need to use some [complex manual method](https://xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/#HOthermethods).\n\nYou can also use the following manual method, which is useful if this extension cannot be installed with the Extension Manager or if you&#x27;re using an old version of XWiki that doesn&#x27;t have the Extension Manager:\n\n1. Log in the wiki with a user having Administration rights\n2. Go to the Administration page and select the Import category\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload the downloaded XAR\n4. Click on the uploaded XAR and follow the instructions\n5. You&#x27;ll also need to install all [dependent Extensions](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HDependencies) that are not already installed in your wiki\n\n",
