  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the 'Bell' in the top right corner is not available, also not when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed. How can I fix this?",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "Sources: https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Model/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIt seems that the bell icon in the top right corner, representing the Alerts Application, should be available in XWiki once you have installed the Alerts Application and the Notifications Application. Since you mentioned that it's not visible, there are a few things you can try to fix this issue:\n\n1. Make sure that both the Alerts Application and the Notifications Application have been installed correctly. You can check this by going to the Extension Manager and looking for these extensions. If they are not installed, you can install them using the Extension Manager.\n2. If the extensions are installed, check if there are any conflicts with other installed extensions. To do this, you can try disabling other extensions temporarily and see if the bell icon appears.\n3. Clear your browser cache and cookies, as this might be causing the issue. You can also try accessing the XWiki instance from a different browser or in incognito mode.\n4. Check if there are any JavaScript or CSS issues causing the bell icon to not display. You can do this by opening the browser console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \"Inspect\") and looking for any error messages.\n5. If none of the above solutions work, you can consider asking for help in the XWiki community forums or opening a bug report in the XWiki JIRA issue tracker. Make sure to include the steps you have taken and any error messages or screenshots to help others diagnose the issue.\n\nYou can also refer to the XWiki documentation for more information on installing and configuring the Alerts Application and the Notifications Application:\n\n* [Alerts Application documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Alerts%20Application/)\n* [Notifications Application documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/)",
