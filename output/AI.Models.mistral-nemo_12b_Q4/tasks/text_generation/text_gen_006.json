  "ai_answer": "In verdant cathedrals where light streams,\nI find the beauty that I dream.\nA woodland floor, a carpet vast,\nOf emerald moss and leaves past.\n\nThe wind whispers through ancient trees,\nTheir bark etched deep with history's breeze.\nEach branch, a tale to slowly tell,\nBeneath their canopy, I dwell.\n\nRivers sing in liquid rhyme,\nAs sunlight dances on their climb;\nTheir waters mirror azure skies,\nIn ceaseless motion, they arise.\n\nWildflowers bloom in riotous hue,\nIn meadows bathed by morning dew.\nTheir delicate perfume fills the air,\nA sweet symphony so rare.\n\nMountains stand sentinel, majestic,\nSnow-crowned kings of nature's regalistic.\nBeneath their peaks, glaciers flow,\nMeltwater's gentle ebb and glow.\n\nNight falls, but still beauty reigns,\nIn constellations' silver trains.\nThe moon illuminates the scene,\nA silvery spotlight on green.\n\nOh, to wander paths untrodden,\nBy nature's hand forever sheltered!\nEach sunrise paints a masterpiece;\nEvery sunset softly pleases.",
