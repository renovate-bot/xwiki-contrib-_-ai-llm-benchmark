The planet, provisionally designated as EOP-1 (Earth-sized Orbital Planet 1), is approximately twice the distance from its star than Earth is from the Sun and lies within the Goldilocks zone where conditions could allow for liquid water to exist on its surface.\n\nThe discovery was made using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and was subsequently confirmed by follow-up observations with ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope. The findings have been submitted for publication in the journal *Astronomy & Astrophysics*.\n\n\"Today marks a monumental milestone in exoplanetary science,\" said Dr. Eva Rodriguez, lead researcher on the study from the University of Chicago. \"While we've known about planets beyond our solar system for decades, this is the first time we've found one that's roughly Earth-sized and potentially capable of harboring life.\"\n\nEOP-1 orbits its parent star, HD 329567, an M-type red dwarf approximately 85 light-years away from Earth. With a radius about twice that of Earth's (~9,000 kilometers) and an estimated mass around six times greater than Earth's (~35,000 kg), EOP-1 is one of the most Earth-like planets yet discovered outside our solar system.\n\nEarly analysis suggests EOP-1 has a rocky composition similar to Earth but with higher iron content. Its surface temperature is estimated at around 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F), well within the range suitable for liquid water to exist. Further studies using atmospheric spectroscopy techniques may soon provide insight into whether EOP-1 indeed has an atmosphere and if so, what gases it might contain.\n\n\"Finding a planet like this is like discovering another Earth,\" commented Dr. Li Wei, co-author of the study from Tsinghua University in Beijing. \"While we're still a long way from proving whether it can support life as we know it, every discovery brings us one step closer.\"\n\nFollow-up observations using upcoming space telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope and PLATO mission will help scientists determine if EOP-1 has any moons or whether there are other planets in its star system. These findings could reveal even more about our own place in the cosmos.\n\n\"This discovery underscores why we continue to explore,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"The universe holds mysteries waiting for us to unravel, and now we've found another piece of that puzzle.\"\n\nAs news of EOP-1's discovery spreads among scientific circles, excitement builds among astronomers eager to learn more about this potential cousin to Earth lurking out there in the cosmos.",
