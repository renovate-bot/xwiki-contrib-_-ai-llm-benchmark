  "expected_answer": "Plants use a special process called photosynthesis to make their own food. They take in sunlight and turn it into energy that helps them grow and stay healthy.",
  "ai_answer": "Photosynthesis is like magic! It's how plants turn sunlight into energy, just like how we can change a battery into energy for our toys. Plants can use this energy to help them grow, stay healthy, and make yummy fruits, vegetables, and flowers for us to enjoy. During photosynthesis, plants also create oxygen, which is super important for us and all the animals to breathe. So next time you're outside, take a moment to appreciate the plants and the sun for their amazing magic trick!",
