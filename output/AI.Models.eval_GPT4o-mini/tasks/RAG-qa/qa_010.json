  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/NestedPagesMigration/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RightsManagement \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/ \n\n\nTo configure permissions in XWiki so that all teams can view all spaces but only edit their own space, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Wiki-Wide View Rights**:\n   - Go to the **Administration** section of your XWiki instance.\n   - Navigate to **Rights Management**.\n   - Set the **View** right to \"All Users\" or the specific group that includes all team members. This will allow everyone to view all spaces.\n\n2. **Set Space-Level Edit Rights**:\n   - For each team's space, go to the space's **Administration**.\n   - Under **Rights**, set the **Edit** right to the specific team group (e.g., Team A, Team B, etc.) for their respective space.\n   - Make sure that the **Edit** right is not granted to \"All Users\" for these spaces, as this would allow everyone to edit them.\n\n3. **Verify Permissions**:\n   - Ensure that the permissions are set correctly. Remember that permissions set at the space level override those set at the wiki level.\n   - You can test the permissions by logging in as a user from each team to confirm that they can view all spaces but can only edit their own.\n\n4. **Consider Group Management**:\n   - If you have not already, create user groups for each team to simplify permission management. This way, you can easily assign rights to groups instead of individual users.\n\nBy following these steps, you will achieve the desired configuration where all teams can view all spaces, but each team can only edit their own space.",

It means that all user-created page are called WebHome.\u00a0\n\nThen, when the user wants to create a sub-page, for example FrankCapra\u00a0inside the page Directors.WebHome, he actually creates a new space inside the space Directors with its WebHome page: Directors.FrankCapra.WebHome. That&#x27;s how we emulate it.\n\nThe notion of space has been removed from the UI. It&#x27;s not mentioned anywhere, anymore. Everything seems to work as if we were really creating sub-pages, even if under the hood, we create sub-spaces.\n\nThat emulation should be temporary. At some point we&#x27;d like to refactor the core model of XWiki and discard the concept of spaces to only keep pages. Don&#x27;t hold your breath though, this may be several years in the coming ![emoticon_wink](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_wink.png?cache-version=1711538036000)\n\nNote that users still have the ability to create pages that are not named WebHome. As a consequence, such pages (that are not the &quot;WebHome&quot; of their space) cannot have sub-pages. They&#x27;re called **Terminal Pages**.\n\n",

Thanks to the different levels of control offered by XWiki, it&#x27;s easy to manage the access to actions like: read, edit, comment etc.\n* You can create groups of users in order to manage the rights of a category of people more easily.\n* Permissions set at a wiki wide level will be overridden by permissions set at a page level, which have priority.\n* When multiple permissions are set at the same wiki/page level, check the priority order of the right in [permission type](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Permission%20types/) to know if access will be allowed or denied.\n* When a right has been allowed at a given level, it gets implicitly denied to anyone else at the same level. This only applies to the right allowed. If only &quot;View&quot; is set to a user/group at this level, all other rights like &quot;Edit&quot; are still inherited. Using this implicit deny behavior is recommended over applying explicit denial.\n* The scope of the right applied (&quot;Page&quot; or &quot;Page &amp; Children&quot;) affects the implicit denial. If the right is applied for the page only, pages below the current page will still inherit the wiki/higher level pages rights.\n* Implied permissions like VIEW of the EDIT right are not implicitly denied when EDIT is set. User/Groups with the VIEW right are still inherited if the page has EDIT explicitly set for a User/Group.\n* On the contrary, an explicit denial does not block inheritance for the right denied.\n",
