  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki the \"Bell\" in the top right corner is not available, also not when the \"Alert Notification\" extension is installed.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "\n\n I'm sorry for any confusion, but it seems there's no specific information related to XWiki or the Bell icon in the top right corner that I can use to provide a detailed answer.\n\nHowever, based on general knowledge, the \"Bell\" icon in many applications often represents notifications or alerts. The fact that you mentioned it's not available in XWiki, even with the \"Alert Notification\" extension installed, suggests that there might be other ways to access notifications within the XWiki platform.\n\nIn XWiki, you can typically find your notifications in the 'Notifications' or 'Activity Stream' menu, often located in the top navigation bar or under your user profile. If you're unable to locate your notifications using these general guidelines, I would recommend checking XWiki's official documentation or contacting their support for more specific assistance.\n\nI hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.",
