  "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5. Repeat for each (sub)wiki for which you need to set this configuration!",
  "ai_answer": "\n\n To ensure that only images or PDF files of up to 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on a whole wiki, you would typically need to modify the wiki's settings if it has a built-in file upload limit feature. If such a feature is not available, you might need to implement custom server-side validation or use a plugin/extension that provides this functionality.\n\nHere are general steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Check for built-in settings:** Look for settings in your wiki software (like MediaWiki, DokuWiki, etc.) that allow you to set upload limits. For example, in MediaWiki, you can modify `$wgMaxUploadSize` in the LocalSettings.php file.\n\n2. **Implement server-side validation:** If your wiki software doesn't have built-in settings, you might need to implement custom server-side validation. This would involve checking the size of the uploaded file before it's saved. The specifics of this would depend on your server environment and the programming language you're using.\n\n3. **Use a plugin/extension:** If available, you could use a plugin or extension that provides this functionality. For example, there are MediaWiki extensions like \"UploadLimit\" that can help you set these limits.\n\nPlease note that the exact steps can vary greatly depending on the wiki software you're using. Always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate information.\n\nRemember, it's important to allow only certain file types (images and PDFs) and set a size limit to prevent potential security risks and maintain optimal performance.",
