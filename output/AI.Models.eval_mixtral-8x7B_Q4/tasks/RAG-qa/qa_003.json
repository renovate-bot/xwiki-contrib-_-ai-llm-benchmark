Make sure that the options related to your own activity are enabled.\n2. **Verify event subscriptions:** If XWiki supports event-based notifications, ensure that you have properly subscribed to the events corresponding to the actions you want to be notified about.\n3. **Clear cache and cookies:** Sometimes, issues like this can be resolved by clearing your browser's cache and cookies, as it may help in refreshing the settings and configurations.\n4. **Contact XWiki support or community:** If none of these suggestions work, consider reaching out to the XWiki support team or community for assistance.
