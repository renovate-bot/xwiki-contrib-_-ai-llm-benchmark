  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile.",
