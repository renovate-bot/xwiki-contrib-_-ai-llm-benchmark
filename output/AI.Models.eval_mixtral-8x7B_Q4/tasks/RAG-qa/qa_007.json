  "prompt": "How do I configure group synchronization between XWiki and my OpenID Connect provider?\nI'm using an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims, and I want to synchronize these groups with XWiki groups. What's the process for setting this up?",
  "expected_answer": "To configure group synchronization between XWiki and your OpenID Connect provider 1. Locate the `xwiki.properties` file in your XWiki installation directory.\n2. Open the file with a text editor.\n3. Configure the group synchronization by setting the `oidc.groups.claim` property to the name of the claim used by your OpenID Connect provider to send group information. For example:\n```java\n#-# The name of the claim used to get the list of groups the user belong to.\n# oidc.groups.claim=groups\n```\nReplace `groups` with the actual claim name provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. If your OpenID Connect provider sends group memberships as a single value attribute delimited by a specific character (e.g., a comma), configure the `oidc.groups.separator` property with the appropriate character:\n```java\n#-# If the identity provider returns group memberships as a single value attribute delimited with a char, for example:\n# oidc.groups.separator=,\n```\nReplace the comma with the actual separator used by your provider.\n1. If you want to map the synchronized groups to specific XWiki groups, configure the `oidc.groups.mapping` property with the appropriate mappings:\n```java\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup\"=group1\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup2\"=group2\n```\nReplace `MyXWikiGroup` and `MyXWikiGroup2` with the names of the XWiki groups you want to map, and `group1` and `group2` with the actual group names provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. Save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.",
  "ai_answer": "\n\n Unfortunately, the provided information does not contain specific details about how to configure group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, I can provide some general steps that you might need to follow:\n\n1. **Check XWiki's OpenID Connect Support**: Ensure that XWiki supports the OpenID Connect provider you are using. XWiki does have built-in support for OpenID Connect, but it might not cover all providers or specific features.\n\n2. **Configure the OpenID Connect Provider**: You'll need to configure your OpenID Connect provider to include group claims in the ID tokens it issues. The exact steps for this will depend on the provider you are using.\n\n3. **Modify XWiki's Configuration**: Once your OpenID Connect provider is set up correctly, you'll need to modify XWiki's configuration to use the group claims provided by the ID token. This might involve writing some custom code or configuration.\n\n4. **Test the Setup**: After making these changes, test the setup by logging into XWiki with your OpenID Connect provider and checking that the correct groups are being synchronized.\n\nPlease note that these are general steps and might not cover all specifics of your situation. For a more accurate answer, you might need to consult the documentation of both XWiki and your OpenID Connect provider, or reach out to their support teams.",
