  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",
  "ai_answer": "\n\n I'm not familiar with any specific configuration in XWiki, but I can suggest a general approach to achieve your goal:\n\n1. **Create separate spaces for each team:** You can create different spaces for each team in XWiki. This will allow you to organize the content and control access levels for each group.\n\n2. **Set up global read access:** To let all teams view all spaces, you need to grant global read access to all users or groups representing the teams. In XWiki, you can do this by configuring the appropriate access rights at the wiki level.\n\n3. **Configure space-level edit permissions:** For restricting editing to specific teams, configure the space-level permissions appropriately. Each space should have a group associated with it that contains only the members of the corresponding team. Set the 'Edit' permission for these groups at the space level, allowing each team to edit only its own space.\n\nHere is an example of how you can format this response using markdown syntax:\n\n# Configuring XWiki Access Control\n\n1. **Create separate spaces for each team:** This will allow organizing content and controlling access levels for each group.\n2. **Set up global read access:** Grant global read access to all users or groups representing the teams at the wiki level, allowing them to view all spaces.\n3. **Configure space-level edit permissions:** Set the 'Edit' permission for team-associated groups at the space level, restricting editing to specific teams and their corresponding spaces.\n\nPlease note that these instructions are general suggestions. The actual configuration might vary depending on your XWiki version or specific setup. Refer to the official XWiki documentation or consult with an XWiki expert for detailed guidance.",
