  "prompt": "Can I customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki?\nI want to map additional user profile fields from my OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. How can I achieve this?",
  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider by mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nTo map additional user profile fields, use the `oidc.user.mapping` property. Here's an example of how to map custom properties:\n\n```\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}\n```\n\nReplace `myxproperty1` and `myxproperty2` with the actual XWiki user property names, and `${oidc.user.subject}` with the appropriate variable based on the data provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n\nAfter configuring the mappings, save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart XWiki to apply the changes.",
  "ai_answer": "\n\n I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided information does not contain specific details about customizing user profile fields in XWiki with OpenID Connect. However, I can provide some general guidance based on my knowledge.\n\nIn many systems, including XWiki, it's possible to customize the mapping of user properties when using an OpenID Connect provider. This process often involves editing the system's configuration files or settings.\n\nFor XWiki specifically, you would typically need to:\n\n1. Access the XWiki Administration interface.\n2. Navigate to the Security section.\n3. Look for a setting related to OpenID Connect or Identity Providers.\n4. There should be an option to customize the attribute mapping.\n\nHowever, the exact steps can vary depending on the version of XWiki you're using and its configuration. If you can't find these options in the Administration interface, you might need to edit the XWiki's `xwiki.cfg` file or another configuration file directly.\n\nPlease refer to the official XWiki documentation or contact your XWiki administrator for more precise instructions.",
