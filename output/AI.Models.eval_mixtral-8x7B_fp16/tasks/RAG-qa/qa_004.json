  "prompt": "In the context of XWiki I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
  "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\nIt sounds like you're receiving notifications about various pages that you're not interested in on XWiki. Here's how you can manage and disable these notifications:\n\n1. **Access Notification Settings**: Click on the notifications menu and you'll find a link to go to the \"settings\" of the notifications.\n\n2. **Notification Types**: By default, users only get notifications when they are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated. If you're receiving notifications about all kinds of pages, it's likely that you have other notification types enabled. You can select which \"types\" of notifications you want to receive. For example, you can choose to receive notifications when a page is created or when a blog post is published.\n\n3. **Applications' Notifications**: You can enable or disable all notification types that belong to a particular application by clicking on the bells associated with this application. If some types are enabled and others are disabled inside an application, the switch will look undetermined.\n\n4. **Custom Notification Filters**: If you're using XWiki 15.5 or a later version, you can create your own custom notification filters. These filters can target only some specific events, and not all event types and all formats. If there's an existing filter targeting the same location, using the watch buttons might impact the filter.\n\n5. **Exclusive Filters**: You can define exclusive filters to exclude some pages from your notifications. Note that exclusive filters take precedence over inclusive filters.\n\nRemember, you only receive notifications that occur after you turn on the notifications types. If you recently enabled a notification type and started receiving unwanted notifications, you can disable that type to stop receiving them.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

So the watch buttons might be in an undecided state if there&#x27;s an existing filter targeting the same location, but only some specific events, or some specific format. The idea is to inform the user that there&#x27;s already a filter for this location and that using the watch buttons might impact the filter.\u00a0\n\nIf a filter is not targeting all event types and all formats, and is actually in contradiction with the filter that would be created by the watch button, then this filter will be automatically disabled when using the watch button. For example, if a user had a filter to ignore all mentions on a space, then watching that exact same space will automatically disable that filter. The user can always review their filters and enable them back.\n\n![notification-watch-undecided.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-watch-undecided.png?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\nXWiki 16.3.0+\u00a0The custom filters are all displayed in a live data which can now be filtered and sorted out:\u00a0\n\n![notification-custom-filters-livedata.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata.png?rev=1.1)  \n![notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notification-custom-filters-livedata-filters.webm?rev=1.1)\n\n\n\n",
