  "expected_answer": "Yes, you can authenticate users with access tokens using the Token-based authentication for the LLM Application extension.\n\nThis extension allows external applications to authenticate users with signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The token needs to contain specific claims, such as expiration time, issuer, subject, and audience, and must be signed with an Ed25519 key.\n\nTo use this authenticator, you need to:\n\n1. Enable the token authenticator by setting the `xwiki.authentication.authclass` property in `xwiki.properties` file to `org.xwiki.contrib.llm.authentication.JWTTokenAuth`.\n2. Configure the authorized applications by adding a new entry to the \"Authorized Applications\" list, specifying the application's title, URL, public key, and group format.\n3. Generate a JWT token that meets the required claims and signing key requirements.\n4. Include the token in the \"Authorization\" header of the request in the form \"Bearer TOKEN\".\n\nNote that this authenticator only supports creating or updating users based on the information provided in the token and does not support using a token as authentication for an existing user that hasn't been created through this authenticator.",

A suitable signing key can, e.g., be generated using the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) command line utility and the following two commands:\n\nopenssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -outform PEM -out private.pem  \nopenssl pkey -in private.pem -pubout -outform PEM -out public.pemThe files &quot;private.pem&quot; and &quot;public.pem&quot; then contain the private and public key in PEM format, respectively.\n\nThe JWT token needs to contain the following claims:\n\n* &quot;exp&quot;: the expiration time, must be in the future but not more than 24 hours in the future\n* &quot;iss&quot;: the issuer, corresponding to the URL property configured in the authorized applications\n* &quot;sub&quot;: the subject, used for deriving the username\n* &quot;aud&quot;: the audience, must contain the URL of the XWiki installation in the form https://www.example.com/ without path. Both a single string and an array of strings are supported. If the expected URL isn&#x27;t passed, an error is logged with the expected URL.\n\nOptional:\n\n* &quot;given\\_name&quot;: used to set the first name field of the user profile\n* &quot;family\\_name&quot;: used to set the last name field of the user profile\n* &quot;email&quot;: used to set the email field of the user profile\n* &quot;groups&quot;: a list of groups (as list of strings). Used to set the groups of the user.\n* &quot;iat&quot;: issued at, the time when the token was issued. Tokens older than 24 hours and tokens issued in the future aren&#x27;t accepted.\n* &quot;nbf&quot;: not before, the token is rejected if this time is in the future.\n\nThe token needs to be present in the &quot;Authorization&quot; header in the form &quot;Bearer TOKEN&quot; where TOKEN is the signed JWT token as described above.\n\n\n",
