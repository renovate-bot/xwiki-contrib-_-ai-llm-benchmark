  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/NestedPagesMigration/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RightsManagement \n\n\nSure, I can help you with that. In XWiki, you can manage permissions at different levels, including the whole wiki or for a specific space and its children. Here's how you can configure the permissions to meet your requirements:\n\n1. **Global permissions**: First, you need to set up the global permissions for the wiki. Go to the **Administration** section, then click on ** Rights **under the **Access Rights** category. Here, you can set up the **Administer Wiki** right for the **Admin** group and the **View** right for **All Users**. This will allow all users to view the wiki, while only the admin can administer it.\n\n2. **Space permissions**: Now, let's set up the permissions for each space. Navigate to the space you want to configure (for example, one of the team spaces), click on the **Space** tool in the left sidebar, and then select **Rights**. Here, you can set up the **Edit** right for the specific team group (for example, **TeamA**) to only allow that team to edit their own space. Make sure to select **Inherited Rights** as **Copy**, so the **View** right is inherited from the parent (the global permissions).\n\n3. **Propagate permissions**: After setting up the permissions for one space, you need to propagate these permissions to all other spaces. To do this, go back to the **Administration** section, click on ** Rights **under the **Access Rights** category, and then click on **Propagate Rights**. Here, you can select the source space (the one you just configured) and the target spaces (all the other team spaces). After propagating the rights, each team will have the appropriate edit permissions for their own space, while all users can view all spaces.\n\nKeep in mind that you should test this configuration on a staging server before applying it to your production instance. Also, be aware that migrating to a new content organization structure, as described in the search results you provided, might affect your current permissions setup. Make sure to review and adjust the permissions after the migration, if necessary.",

It means that all user-created page are called WebHome.\u00a0\n\nThen, when the user wants to create a sub-page, for example FrankCapra\u00a0inside the page Directors.WebHome, he actually creates a new space inside the space Directors with its WebHome page: Directors.FrankCapra.WebHome. That&#x27;s how we emulate it.\n\nThe notion of space has been removed from the UI. It&#x27;s not mentioned anywhere, anymore. Everything seems to work as if we were really creating sub-pages, even if under the hood, we create sub-spaces.\n\nThat emulation should be temporary. At some point we&#x27;d like to refactor the core model of XWiki and discard the concept of spaces to only keep pages. Don&#x27;t hold your breath though, this may be several years in the coming ![emoticon_wink](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_wink.png?cache-version=1711538036000)\n\nNote that users still have the ability to create pages that are not named WebHome. As a consequence, such pages (that are not the &quot;WebHome&quot; of their space) cannot have sub-pages. They&#x27;re called **Terminal Pages**.\n\n",

The process could be very long. It will use a lot of server resources, so we recommend to don&#x27;t let users access the wiki during the process.

Note that we have experienced better performances using Chrome instead of Firefox.\n* Some OutOfMemory errors could happen. To avoid them, we recommend to give a lot of memory to your XWiki instance during the execution of the migration.\n* To minimize migration time, we recommend that you ensure that the Solr queue is empty before starting the migration. You can check Solr queue on the Wiki administration&gt;&gt;Solr Search Section, see [documentation](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Solr%20Search%20Application#HSearchAdministrationSection).\n**We highly recommend to perform migration tests on a staging server before doing it on a production instance.**\n\n",
