  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/Permission%20types/ \n\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot refuse the script right to a space administrator because the script right is tied to the administrator's role and is granted automatically when the administrator role is assigned. This is a security feature to ensure that administrators have the necessary permissions to manage the wiki.\n\nHowever, you can manage the permissions of your wiki pages to limit the potential damage that could be caused by a malicious script. For example, you can set the page permissions so that only administrators have the edit and delete rights, which would prevent non-administrators from modifying the page content.\n\nHere are the steps to set the page permissions:\n\n1. Navigate to the page for which you want to set the permissions.\n2. Click on the cog button and select \"Administer Page\".\n3. Click on \"Users & Groups\" in the left-hand menu.\n4. Click on \"Rights: Page & Children\" or \"Rights: Page\" to set the permissions for the current page or the current page and its children.\n5. Use the checkboxes to allow or deny the desired permissions for the relevant users or groups.\n\nRemember that permissions are checked in the following order: page > wiki. This means that if a permission is denied at the page level, it will override any conflicting permission settings at the wiki level.",
