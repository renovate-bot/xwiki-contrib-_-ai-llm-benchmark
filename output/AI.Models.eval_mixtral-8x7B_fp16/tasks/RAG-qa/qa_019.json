  "expected_answer": "Leider wird dies in XWiki nicht unterst\u00fctzt, Rechte, die durch das Admin-Recht impliziert sind, k\u00f6nnen nicht verweigert werden.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module \n\n\nTo deny the script right to a space administrator, you would need to configure the AuthorizationSettler component, which is responsible for making access decisions in XWiki. The interpretation of right definitions, such as the script right, is up to the AuthorizationSettler.\n\nHowever, XWiki does not provide a built-in way to deny the script right to a space administrator, as the default rights are predefined and the script right is bundled with the authorization modules for primary actions of XWiki.\n\nIf you want to modify the rights of a space administrator, you would need to create a custom AuthorizationSettler and configure it to change the default behavior. This would involve creating a new RightDescription for the script right and then using the `register` method to add it as an implied right to the set of rights, but with a different configuration that denies the right to space administrators.\n\nKeep in mind that this would require a good understanding of the XWiki security system and the ability to write custom code. If you are not comfortable with this, you may want to consider another approach, such as creating a custom role with the desired permissions and assigning it to the appropriate users.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

      "content": "Therefore, the real task of settling access decisions is entirely delegated to customizable components that may be introduce by third parties and configured without rebuilding the platform. The component hint of the AuthorizationSettler may be configured from the ConfigurationSource (xwiki.properties) using the key security.authorization.settler. The default hint &quot;default&quot; is implemented by the DefaultAuthorizationSettler. Another experimental PriorityAuthorizationSettler (currently unmaintained, use at your own risk) is also bundled. Both are based on a AbstractAuthorizationSettler which provide a common foundation for merging access provide at each hierarchy level based on a customizable dynamic policy.\n\n### Right definitions\n\nSince the settling process is delegated to the AuthorizationSettler, the interpretation of right definitions is up to it, and right definition is only a tool for helping the creation of an expandable authorization settler, allowing new rights to be easily externally defined. New Right maybe registered with the AuthorizationManager using a RightDescription. The meaning of the right definition explained here is mostly pertinent for the default implementation of the AuthorizationSettler, and should normally be followed by any other settler implementation, but this could not be guaranteed.\n\n",
