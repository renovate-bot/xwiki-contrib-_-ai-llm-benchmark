  "expected_answer": "This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/Permission%20types/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/ \n\n\nUnfortunately, based on the provided information, it is not possible to deny the 'SCRIPT' right to a space administrator in XWiki. The 'SCRIPT' right is a programming permission that allows a user to execute arbitrary Java code in the wiki, and it can only be granted or denied at the main wiki level.\n\nSpace administrators are typically granted a set of permissions at the wiki level, including the 'ADMIN' right, which automatically includes the 'VIEW', 'COMMENT', 'EDIT', and 'DELETE' permissions. However, the 'SCRIPT' right is not one of the permissions included in the 'ADMIN' right.\n\nTo grant or deny the 'SCRIPT' right, you need to go to the wiki preferences page in a single wiki environment or the main wiki in a multi-wiki environment. Since space administrators typically have the 'ADMIN' right at the wiki level, denying the 'SCRIPT' right for them would mean denying it for all users with the 'ADMIN' right, which may not be desirable.\n\nTherefore, if you want to restrict the use of 'SCRIPT' right, you may need to consider other options, such as setting up a separate wiki or space with restricted permissions or implementing access control policies at the code level.",
