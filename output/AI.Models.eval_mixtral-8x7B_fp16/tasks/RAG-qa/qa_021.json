  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nIt seems like you're having trouble with the notifications bell icon in your XWiki platform, even after installing the \"Notification Alert\" extension.\n\nThe notifications feature in XWiki can be customized and managed through various macros. These macros allow you to display notifications, manage notifications applications preferences, auto-watched pages, custom filters, and email preferences.\n\nHowever, the issue you're facing might not be related to these macros. The notifications bell icon might be related to a specific application, such as the Notifications Application. Based on the information you provided, it seems that you have correctly installed the Notifications Application.\n\nIf the notifications bell icon is still not available, you might want to check the following:\n\n1. Make sure you have the correct permissions: Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to view and manage notifications.\n2. Clear your browser cache: Sometimes, issues like this can be caused by browser caching. Try clearing your browser cache and then refreshing the page.\n3. Check for JavaScript errors: Open your browser's developer console and look for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the notifications bell icon from displaying.\n4. Verify your XWiki version: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of XWiki with the Notifications Application and the \"Notification Alert\" extension.\n\nIf none of these steps help, you may want to reach out to the XWiki community or the support team for further assistance. They can help you diagnose and resolve the issue with the notifications bell icon.",

      "content": "## Emails\n\nYou can also select some types of notifications that you will receive by email. You can have different choices enabled by email and in the menu. Then, on the very bottom of the page, you can select the interval between 2 emails. For example, if you choose &quot;Daily&quot; (default), you will receive one email every day with the recap of the events that have happened during the day. Of course, if there were no activity in this period of time, no email is sent.\u00a0\n\nLive notifications emails can be sent to a user. The wiki administrator can also define a &quot;grace time&quot; for live email notifications ; when an event that triggers a notification is sent, the platform will wait for the duration of this grace time before sending a notification email. If during this interval, a new event of the same kind is sent, the two events will be grouped in the same email. You can get more informations on how to configure this feature [here](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/#HCustomizeliveemailnotificationsgracetime).\n\nOf course, it works only if the user has properly filled her e-mail address.\n\nYou can edit the frequency of your email notifications by using the selector just at the bottom of the notification preferences pane in your profile page :\n\n![notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/notificationPreferencesEmailUI.png?rev=1.4)\n\nThe notifications are sorted by pages and dates, and a table of content summarizes all notifications contained in the email:\n\n![NotifEmailTOC.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailTOC.png?rev=1.3)\n\nA breadcrumb is displayed on top of each notification that concern a page:\n\n![NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Extension/Notifications%20Application/WebHome/NotifEmailBreadcrumb.png?rev=1.3)\n\n",
