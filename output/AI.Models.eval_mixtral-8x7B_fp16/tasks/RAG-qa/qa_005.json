  "prompt": "How can I configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect?\nI've set up OpenID Connect authentication in my XWiki instance, but users are not automatically enabled after their first login. What configuration do I need to adjust?",
  "expected_answer": "To automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect in XWiki, you need to adjust the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nAdd or update the following property:\n\n```\n#-# Define if user accounts should be enabled (marked as active) on first login\n# oidc.enableUser=true\n```\n\nMake sure to uncomment and set the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true`. After making this change, save the file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.\n\nThis will ensure that new user accounts are automatically enabled when they log in for the first time via OpenID Connect.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Authenticator/ \n\n\nThe information provided doesn't seem to directly address the issue of automatically enabling user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, I can provide some general guidance on how you might approach this issue.\n\nIn XWiki, user accounts are typically created when a user logs in for the first time, but this behavior might not be the case when using OpenID Connect. You might need to customize the authentication process to achieve this.\n\nHere are some general steps you could follow:\n\n1. **Locate the authentication event:** XWiki likely has an event that triggers when a user successfully authenticates. You'll need to find this event and create a listener for it.\n\n2. **Create a listener:** This listener should check if the authenticated user exists in the XWiki database. If the user doesn't exist, it should create a new user account.\n\nPlease note that this is a general approach and might not be applicable out-of-the-box. You might need to write some custom code to achieve this. If you're not comfortable with this, I recommend reaching out to the XWiki community or considering hiring a developer with XWiki expertise.\n\nAs for the configuration of OpenID Connect, you might want to check the `xwiki.cfg` file for any settings related to user creation or synchronization. However, the specific setting you're looking for is not mentioned in the provided information.\n\nLastly, there's an open issue in the XWiki JIRA ([OIDC-16](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/OIDC-16)) about automatically authenticating users when they come back, which might be related to your question. You might want to follow this issue for updates.",

If your XWiki instance has very different domains for its wikis, this fix will not work.\n\nWhen using Tomcat as a servlet container, it&#x27;s possible to change the domain of the cookie JSESSIONID by adding the attribute sessionCookieDomain to context.xml as such :\n\n&lt;Context sessionCookieDomain=&quot;mytld.org&quot;&gt;  \n...  \n&lt;/Context&gt;# Endpoints\n\n## Callback\n\npath: **authenticator/callback**\n\n## [Back-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html)\n\npath: **authenticator/backchannel\\_logout**\n\n# Bypass OpenID Connect\n\nAs indicated in the previous section you can disable OpenID Connect using the property oidc.skipped in the xwiki.properties file.\n\nIt&#x27;s also possible to skip OpenId Connect temporarily using a URL parameter: for example https://mydomain/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?oidc.skipped=true.\n\n",
