  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/Permission%20types/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Security%20Module \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/NestedPagesMigration/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Accessibility/ \n\n\n You cannot directly refuse the scripting right to a space administrator because this right is granted by default to all space administrators. However, you can remove the user from the list of space administrators if you have administration rights on the space or if you are a superadmin.\n\nTo remove a user from the list of space administrators, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the space where the user has administrator rights.\n2. Click on the \"Admin\" button located at the top of the page.\n3. In the left menu, click on \"Space Permissions\".\n4. Under \"Space Administrators\", find the username you want to remove and click the trash icon next to it.\n5. Confirm the removal by clicking \"OK\" in the confirmation popup.\n\nAfter removing the user from the list of space administrators, they will no longer have the scripting right on this space, but they will still be able to perform other actions allowed by their global permissions. If you want to remove the scripting right without changing the user's role in the space, please see the following solution:\n\nYou can create a custom right that allows only specific access and grant it to users or groups. In your case, you would need to create a custom right with no script permission, then revoke the script right from all administrators except those who need it. This solution requires more effort than simply removing a user from the list of space administrators, but it provides more granular control over rights management.\n\nTo create a custom right and manage permissions, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in as a superadmin or an admin with sufficient permissions to modify rights.\n2. Go to Administration > Rights Management.\n3. Click \"Add Right\".\n4. Configure your new right as desired (for example, without script permission) and click \"Save\".\n5. Navigate to the space where you want to manage custom rights.\n6. Click \"Admin\" > \"Space Permissions\".\n7. In the left menu, click on \"Global Rights\" or \"Document Rights\", depending on your needs.\n8. Grant or revoke the new right for specific users or groups as desired. Remember to remove the script right from administrators who don't need it, while keeping other rights intact.\n9. Click \"Save\".\n\nBy creating a custom right with specific permissions and managing it at different levels (global, space, document), you can have more granular control over user permissions in XWiki.",

Anyone with edit rights can write a script in a wiki page. However, when the page is rendered, the script will only execute if the last author of the page has the &quot;Script&quot; right.\n\nXWiki &lt;14.10 For backward-compatibility reasons, the standard XWiki distribution comes with the &quot;Script&quot; right being allowed for all users at the main wiki level. So, unless an administrator explicitly revokes the right for some users or groups, they will be able to execute the scripts they wrote.\n\nXWiki 14.10+ The script right gives a lot of power to users so by default the right is not given anymore to all users at the main wiki level: administrators have to manually allow it.\n\n* Availability: Page and Wiki level.\n* Default status:\n\t+ ALLOWED on the main wiki\n\t+ DENIED on sub-wikis\n* Priority order: deny &gt; allow &gt; no setting\n* Checking order: page &gt; wiki\n\n",
