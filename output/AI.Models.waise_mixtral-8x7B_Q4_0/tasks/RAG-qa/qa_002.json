  "prompt": "I'm not receiving any notifications.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\n There could be several reasons why you are not receiving any notifications. Here are some things you can check:\n\n1. Make sure that your email address is correctly set in your user profile. You can do this by going to the \"Preferences\" menu, then selecting \"Edit Profile\". If your email address is missing or incorrect, update it and save the changes.\n2. Check if the notifications are enabled for your account. Go to the \"Preferences\" menu, then select \"Notifications\". Make sure that the \"Email Notification\" option is checked.\n3. Check if the events you're expecting to receive notifications for are being sent properly by the application or the wiki. For example, if you expect to be notified when a new page is created but no notification is received, it might be because the page creation event is not being triggered or the event is filtered out by your notification settings.\n4. Check if the emails are being blocked or marked as spam by your email provider. You can check this by looking at your email spam folder or contacting your email provider's support team.\n5. If none of the above solutions work, try adjusting the grace time for email notifications. Go to the \"Preferences\" menu, then select \"Notifications\". Under \"Email Notification\", you can find an option to set the grace time for email notifications. Increasing this value might help grouping multiple notifications into a single email and reduce the number of emails sent.\n\nI hope these suggestions help. If you're still experiencing issues with receiving notifications, please provide more details about the events you're expecting to receive notifications for and any error messages or symptoms you've observed.",
