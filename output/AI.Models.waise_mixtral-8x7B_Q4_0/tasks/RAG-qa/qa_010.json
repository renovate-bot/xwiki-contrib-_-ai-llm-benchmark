  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",
  "ai_answer": "https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/RightsManagement \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/ContentOrganization/NestedPagesMigration/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/PageEditing \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Configuration/ \n\n\n To achieve this, you can use the [Access Rights feature](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/AccessRights) in XWiki. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Create a new space for each team and assign the appropriate users as members of their respective teams.\n2. Set the access rights for each space so that all users have view access, but only users with the \"Edit\" right can edit the content in the space.\n3. Use XWiki's [Groups feature](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/AccessRights/#HUsinggroups) to create a group for each team, and add all of the users who are members of that team to their respective groups.\n4. Set the access rights for each space so that only users in the appropriate group can edit the content in the space.\n\nHere is an example of how you could set up the access rights for a team's space:\n\n1. Go to the \"Admin\" menu and select \"Access Rights\".\n2. Select the space that you want to configure.\n3. Under the \"Edit rights\" section, grant view access to \"All users\".\n4. Under the \"Edit rights\" section, grant edit access to \"XWiki.TeamNameGroup\", where \"TeamName\" is the name of the group for the team that should be able to edit the space.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each space.\n\nBy following these steps, all users will be able to view all spaces, but only users in the appropriate group will be able to edit their own team's space.",

It means that all user-created page are called WebHome.\u00a0\n\nThen, when the user wants to create a sub-page, for example FrankCapra\u00a0inside the page Directors.WebHome, he actually creates a new space inside the space Directors with its WebHome page: Directors.FrankCapra.WebHome. That&#x27;s how we emulate it.\n\nThe notion of space has been removed from the UI. It&#x27;s not mentioned anywhere, anymore. Everything seems to work as if we were really creating sub-pages, even if under the hood, we create sub-spaces.\n\nThat emulation should be temporary. At some point we&#x27;d like to refactor the core model of XWiki and discard the concept of spaces to only keep pages. Don&#x27;t hold your breath though, this may be several years in the coming ![emoticon_wink](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_wink.png?cache-version=1711538036000)\n\nNote that users still have the ability to create pages that are not named WebHome.

Thanks to the different levels of control offered by XWiki, it&#x27;s easy to manage the access to actions like: read, edit, comment etc.\n* You can create groups of users in order to manage the rights of a category of people more easily.\n* Permissions set at a wiki wide level will be overridden by permissions set at a page level, which have priority.\n* When multiple permissions are set at the same wiki/page level, check the priority order of the right in [permission type](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Permission%20types/) to know if access will be allowed or denied.\n* When a right has been allowed at a given level, it gets implicitly denied to anyone else at the same level. This only applies to the right allowed. If only &quot;View&quot; is set to a user/group at this level, all other rights like &quot;Edit&quot; are still inherited. Using this implicit deny behavior is recommended over applying explicit denial.\n* The scope of the right applied (&quot;Page&quot; or &quot;Page &amp; Children&quot;) affects the implicit denial. If the right is applied for the page only, pages below the current page will still inherit the wiki/higher level pages rights.\n* Implied permissions like VIEW of the EDIT right are not implicitly denied when EDIT is set. User/Groups with the VIEW right are still inherited if the page has EDIT explicitly set for a User/Group.\n* On the contrary, an explicit denial does not block inheritance for the right denied.\n",
