  "reason": "The score is 0.78 because the summary includes some contradictions, such as the ability to modify existing feeds through the Main.WebRss page, which is not mentioned in the original text. Additionally, the summary adds extra information by specifying a particular browser, Firefox, which is not mentioned in the original text.
