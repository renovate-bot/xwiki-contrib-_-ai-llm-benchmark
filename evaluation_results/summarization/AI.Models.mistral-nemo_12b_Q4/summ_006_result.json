  "reason": "The score is 0.60 because the summary includes incorrect information about the resources available to developers, adding the Extensions Wiki and XWiki Rendering Wiki, which are not mentioned in the original text. Additionally, the summary introduces extra information about users learning to create, edit, and view history of pages, which is not in the original text. Furthermore, the summary fails to address questions about starting a new wiki and whether XWiki is a second generation wiki, which the original text can answer.",
