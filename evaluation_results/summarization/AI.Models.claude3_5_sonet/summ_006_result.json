  "score": 0.4166666666666667,
  "reason": "The score is 0.42 because the summary includes extra information not present in the original text, such as details about login credentials, user permissions, developer access, and documentation links. Additionally, the summary fails to answer whether XWiki is described as a second generation wiki, which the original text can answer. These issues indicate a lack of alignment and completeness between the summary and the original text.",
