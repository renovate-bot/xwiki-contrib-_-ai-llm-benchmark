  "score": 0.4,
  "reason": "The score is 0.40 because the summary contains multiple contradictions with the original text, such as the location of the tabbed area and the scope of actions possible. Additionally, it includes extra information not found in the original text, like XWiki being a collaborative content management system and the use of wikis for content separation. Furthermore, the summary fails to answer several questions that the original text can address, such as editing capabilities and export options in XWiki.",
