  "score": 0.75,
  "reason": "The score is 0.75 because the summary contains a contradiction regarding the location of the 'History' menu item and includes extra information about a 'Version Control page on XWiki.org' not present in the original text. Additionally, the summary fails to address whether all content added to XWiki is saved over time, which the original text can answer. Despite these issues, the summary is still relatively accurate and informative.",
