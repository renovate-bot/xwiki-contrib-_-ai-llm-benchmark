  "reason": "The score is 0.20 because the summary contains significant contradictions regarding the default status of the view right, which is misrepresented as 'deny' or 'no setting' instead of 'ALLOWED' at both the Page and Wiki levels. Additionally, the summary fails to answer several key questions that the original text addresses, such as the default status of the comment right and details about delete, administration, and programming rights.",
