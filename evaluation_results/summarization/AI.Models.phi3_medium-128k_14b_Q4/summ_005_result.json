  "reason": "The score is 0.60 because the summary contradicts the original text by categorizing RSS feeds into 'Available Feeds' and 'Customized RSS Feeds', which is not mentioned in the original text. Additionally, the summary fails to answer specific questions that the original text addresses, such as the availability of a feed for all modified pages and the existence of an RSS feed for search results if the Search application is installed.",
