  "score": 0.6666666666666666,
  "reason": "The score is 0.67 because the summary contains multiple pieces of contradicting information, such as the capabilities of 'Modified Pages' and 'Watchlist', and the inclusion of screenshots and links. Additionally, it adds extra information not present in the original text, like XWiki being a collaborative wiki platform. Furthermore, the summary fails to answer questions that the original text can, such as the availability of a feed for all modified pages from the Notifications Application.",
