  "reason": "The score is 0.75 because the summary includes extra information not present in the original text, such as a 'Version Control page on XWiki.org' and learning to change the logo and panels. Additionally, the summary fails to answer a question that the original text can, specifically whether all content added to the wiki is saved over time.",
