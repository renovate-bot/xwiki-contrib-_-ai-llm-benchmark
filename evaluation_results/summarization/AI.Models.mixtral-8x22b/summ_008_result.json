{
  "score": 0.6,
  "reason": "The score is 0.60 because the summary includes extra information not present in the original text, such as predefined configurations, screenshots, visiting XWiki.org, and creating a basic application. Additionally, the summary fails to answer questions that the original text can, such as whether XWiki allows admins to create new user accounts and if there is a configuration for admin-only content viewing and editing. Despite no contradictions, these issues impact the summary's completeness and accuracy.",
