  "score": 0.5,
  "reason": "The score is 0.50 because the summary contains multiple contradictions with the original text, such as omitting the 'Tabbed area' at the bottom of the page, misrepresenting where certain actions can be performed, and incorrectly suggesting that the main wiki contains all content when starting out. Additionally, the summary fails to answer a question that the original text can, specifically about the display of panels on both sides of a page in XWiki.",
