  "reason": "The score is 0.80 because the summary includes extra information not present in the original text, such as an 'XWiki Version Control page,' and fails to answer a question that the original text can address regarding whether all content added to XWiki is saved over time. Despite these issues, the summary is largely accurate, reflecting a good understanding of the original text.",
