  "reason": "The Actual Output addresses the Input prompt by providing a creative space adventure story and aligns well with the Expected Output by focusing on astronauts exploring new frontiers. However, it deviates slightly by including an asteroid mining subplot, which adds complexity but slightly strays from the core theme of exploring a new planet. The story is coherent, fluent, and well-written.",
