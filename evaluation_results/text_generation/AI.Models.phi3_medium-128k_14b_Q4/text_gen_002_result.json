  "reason": "The Actual Output directly addresses the Input prompt by incorporating all keywords into a coherent sentence. It maintains logical flow and consistency with the Expected Output, differing only by using 'frolicking in the vibrant garden' instead of 'exploring the garden,' which slightly enhances descriptiveness but remains aligned with the intended meaning. The sentence is fluent, grammatically correct, and readable.",
