  "reason": "The Actual Output effectively addresses the Input prompt by adapting the text for a technical audience, aligning well with the Expected Output in terms of relevance and coherence. It maintains fluency and introduces technical terms like 'central processing unit' and 'neural networks.' However, it slightly diverges by adding more detail than the Expected Output, such as mentioning 'creativity, emotion, and motivation.'",
