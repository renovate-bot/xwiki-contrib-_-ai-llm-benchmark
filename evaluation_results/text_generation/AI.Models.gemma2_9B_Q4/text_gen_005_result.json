  "reason": "The Actual Output is a creative space adventure story that aligns well with the Input prompt. It features a space crew on a mission, addressing the topic effectively. However, it diverges from the Expected Output, which specifies a story about astronauts exploring a new planet, whereas the Actual Output focuses on a nebula and a mythical plant. Despite this, the story is coherent, fluent, and engaging.",
