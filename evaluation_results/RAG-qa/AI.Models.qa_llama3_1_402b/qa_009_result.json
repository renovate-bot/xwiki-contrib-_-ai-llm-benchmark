  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes URLs that do not directly address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses methods for checking access rights in code, but does not address the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator. Similarly, the second node talks about the usage of the checkAccess() method without providing information on denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the sentence 'This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.' is not found in any part of the provided nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention that rights implied by admin right cannot be denied, which is the core information in the expected output."
