  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, with only a minor irrelevant mention of Nested Pages Migration.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses programming rights but does not address denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node outlines rights but does not mention the inability to deny script rights. The third node details the 'Script' right but does not mention denial to a space administrator. The fourth node talks about access checks, unrelated to denying script rights. The fifth node is about converting rights during migration, not related to denying script rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, matching the expected answer's statement about XWiki's lack of support for denying such rights.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output incorrectly states that script rights can be denied to a space administrator, while the expected output clearly states that rights implied by admin right cannot be denied in XWiki."
