    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'group synchronization and customization for OpenID Connect,' which is not relevant to authenticating users with access tokens. Similarly, the second node talks about 'protection levels for cookies and security strategies for failed login attempts,' which does not relate to access token-based user authentication.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about the LLM-Anwendung (BETA)-Erweiterung or the specific steps for enabling and configuring JWT token-based authentication."
