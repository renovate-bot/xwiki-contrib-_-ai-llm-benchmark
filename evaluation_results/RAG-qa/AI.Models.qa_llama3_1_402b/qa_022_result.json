  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant, but the provided URL does not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.75 because the actual output mentions a 'Filtres' link and a 'Toutes les notifications' link in the notification menu, which are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and settings for notifications,' which is not about enabling notifications or following users/pages. Similarly, the second node is about 'overriding default notification templates and installing extensions,' which is unrelated to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not provide any information related to ensuring notifications are activated, following pages or users, or the specific processes mentioned in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on `xwiki.properties`, the alert menu, and the network tab in the user profile."
