  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes a source link and a link to XWiki syntax documentation that do not directly address the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are perfectly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'Enable and disable the extension' and 'Enabling notifications for all users by default', which directly relates to ensuring notifications are activated. The second node includes 'Follow a user', which is relevant to the guidance on following users to receive notifications. The irrelevant nodes, ranked third and fourth, discuss topics like 'getting a notification RSS feed and settings' and 'various notification preferences macros', which do not directly address the specific actions needed to ensure notifications are received.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while nodes in the retrieval context support the general concepts of enabling notifications and following users or pages (as seen in sentences 1, 3, and 5 of the expected output), they lack specific details such as setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties', the 'alerte' menu, and the 'r\u00e9seau' tab mentioned in sentences 2, 4, and 6.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting 'notifications.enabled' to true and specifics on following pages or users as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks specific instructions on setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` and following pages or users for notifications, which are critical in the expected output. It focuses more on general settings and troubleshooting, which is inconsistent with the detailed steps outlined in the expected output."
