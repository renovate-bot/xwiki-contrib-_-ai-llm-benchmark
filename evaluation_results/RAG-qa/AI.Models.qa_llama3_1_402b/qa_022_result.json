  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes a source link that does not directly address the problem, which prevents the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly claims that notifications are enabled for all users by default, whereas the retrieval context specifies that only administrators have the ability to enable notifications for all users by default.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'various features and settings related to notifications' but does not address enabling notifications or following users. The second node mentions 'settings and filters' without providing information about enabling notifications or following users. The third node talks about 'RSS feeds and notification settings' but lacks details on enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` or following users. The fourth node describes 'various notification preferences macros' but fails to address enabling notifications or following users.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some nodes in the retrieval context support the general idea of enabling notifications and following users or pages, specific details such as setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties', using the 'alerte' menu, and viewing followed users in the 'r\u00e9seau' tab are not covered.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` and specifics on following pages or accessing user profiles."
