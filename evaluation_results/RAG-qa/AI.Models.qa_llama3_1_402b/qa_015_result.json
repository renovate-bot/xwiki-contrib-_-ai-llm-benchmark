  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect, without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses the `xwiki.properties` file necessary for enabling user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect, is ranked fourth. The first three nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant as they discuss 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', 'general information about OpenID Connect and its installation', and 'OpenID Connect Authenticator compatibility without mentioning the `xwiki.properties` or `oidc.enableUser` property', which should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 4th node in the retrieval context mentions the xwiki.properties file and OpenID Connect, it does not provide specific instructions on adding or updating properties, saving the file, or restarting the XWiki instance, which are key details in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about modifying the xwiki.properties file or the oidc.enableUser property for automatic user activation."
