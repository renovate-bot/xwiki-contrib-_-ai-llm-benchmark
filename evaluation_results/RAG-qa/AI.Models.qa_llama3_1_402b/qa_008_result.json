  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output perfectly addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked third, provides information on setting maximum attachment size and mentions mimetype restrictions, which are directly related to the input. However, irrelevant nodes ranked first, second, fourth, and fifth discuss topics such as linking to external files and images, general overview of XWiki's structure, attachment display and security settings, and versioning and storage of attachments, none of which address the configuration of upload size or mimetype restrictions. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.64 because while nodes in the retrieval context support detailed steps for configuring mimetypes and maximum attachment size (as seen in sentences 2-7), introductory and explanatory sentences (1 and 8) and step titles (9 and 10) are not directly supported by the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details on setting 10MB limit and mimetype allowList.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly mentions setting the maximum upload size to 10MB and configuring mimetype restrictions. However, it introduces the Attachment Validation Application not mentioned in the expected output and uses 'attachment.upload.allowedMimeTypes' instead of 'attachment.upload.allowList'."
