  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response is mostly relevant and addresses the question about configuring XWiki for OpenID Connect. However, it includes an irrelevant statement about LDAP authentication, which slightly detracts from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions the property '# oidc.enableUser=true', is ranked first. This directly addresses the need to enable user accounts on first login using OpenID Connect, as required by the input. The irrelevant nodes, discussing topics like domain-based authentication, general OpenID Connect information, container authentication, and LDAP, are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because only the first sentence regarding the property '# oidc.enableUser=true' is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, while the rest of the instructions and explanations lack direct support from any node.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes the key information about the 'oidc.enableUser' property, which matches the expected answer's requirement to uncomment and set it to 'true'. However, it lacks explicit instructions on saving the file and restarting XWiki.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly identifies the `oidc.enableUser` property in `xwiki.properties`, specifies setting it to `true`, and explains its purpose. However, it omits the instruction to uncomment the property and the need to save the file and restart XWiki. It also contains additional information about other authentication methods not mentioned in the expected output."
