  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response is mostly relevant and provides useful information about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes a mention of LDAP authentication, which is not pertinent to the question, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Everything aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which includes the line '# oidc.enableUser=true' directly related to the configuration needed, is ranked first. This ensures that users receive the most pertinent information immediately, leading to a perfect score. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context includes the key detail about enabling user accounts with the 'oidc.enableUser=true' property (as mentioned in sentences 1 and 2 of the expected output), it lacks information on the procedural steps such as adding or updating properties, saving the file, and restarting XWiki, which are crucial for the complete implementation described in sentences 3 to 5.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes the property '# oidc.enableUser=true' which matches the expected answer about enabling user accounts on first login. However, it lacks explicit instructions on uncommenting and setting it to 'true', saving the file, and restarting XWiki."
