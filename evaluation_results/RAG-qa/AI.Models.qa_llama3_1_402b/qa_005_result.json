  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer mostly addresses the configuration of OpenID Connect authentication and enabling user accounts. However, it includes irrelevant details about the XWiki RESTful API and Access Rights, which do not directly pertain to the specific configuration issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'does not provide any information about configuring user accounts to be automatically enabled upon first login,' and the second node 'does not provide the specific configuration needed to automatically enable user accounts.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
