  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the answer provides relevant information about denying script rights to a space administrator, but it includes multiple irrelevant links that do not address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node contains 'a series of image links and references', which does not provide any information relevant to the question. Similarly, the second node discusses 'authentication and LDAP configuration', which is not related to the question. The third node is about 'mail templates for password reset and username recovery', which is also irrelevant. The fourth node provides 'installation instructions for an extension', and the fifth node discusses 'form utilization and adding references', both of which are not related to the question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output discusses XWiki's rights management and admin rights implications, which are not mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to the admin rights or their denial in XWiki, as mentioned in the expected output."
