  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first three nodes provide crucial information on configuring the 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.mapping' properties, which are essential for group synchronization as required in the input. The irrelevant nodes, ranked fourth and fifth, focus on installation instructions and authentication management, which are not directly related to the group synchronization process. Great job on the ranking!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide specific details about properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', many sentences in the expected output are general instructions or introductory statements that do not directly match any specific part of the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes details about configuring 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', which align with the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions to save the file and restart the XWiki instance."
