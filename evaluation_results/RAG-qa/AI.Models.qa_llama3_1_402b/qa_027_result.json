  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which 'directly mentions group synchronization, including the use of claims and mapping properties,' is ranked third. The first and second nodes, which 'do not address group synchronization or the specific properties needed for it' and 'do not provide details on group synchronization configuration,' are ranked higher than the relevant node. This lowers the score since irrelevant nodes are prioritized over the relevant one.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.44 because while the retrieval context nodes support the general concept of group synchronization and configuration in XWiki, they lack specific details such as opening the file with a text editor, replacing placeholder values, and saving and restarting XWiki, which are crucial for a complete understanding.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks details on configuring oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator, which are present in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output introduces properties `oidc.userinfoclaims` and `oidc.groupsync.enabled` not found in expected output, lacks details on configuring `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.separator`."
