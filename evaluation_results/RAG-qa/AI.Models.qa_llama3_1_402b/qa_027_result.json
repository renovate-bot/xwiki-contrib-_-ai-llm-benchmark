  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the third node, directly addresses group synchronization by mentioning the use of claims and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property, and is ranked after two irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses authentication management and endpoints without mentioning group synchronization, and the second node talks about authentication methods without providing details on group synchronization, both of which should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context provides some relevant information about configuring group synchronization in XWiki, it lacks details on specific steps such as locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, setting properties with examples, and saving changes, which are crucial for a complete understanding.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping but lacks details on oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator properties, which are present in the expected output."
