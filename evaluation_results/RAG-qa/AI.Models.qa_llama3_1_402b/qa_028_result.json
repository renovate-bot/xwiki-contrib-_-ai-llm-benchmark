  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the output contains useful information relevant to configuring file upload settings, but it also includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the specific question about restricting file types and sizes.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'various macros and their functionalities' which is unrelated to configuring attachment upload restrictions. The second node explains 'how to customize the PDF cover by overriding the template pdfcover.vm', which does not pertain to setting MIME types or file size limits for attachments. Additionally, the third node describes 'how to create a new page by adding a wanted link', which is not related to configuring attachment upload settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about configuring MIME types or setting the maximum upload size for attachments."
