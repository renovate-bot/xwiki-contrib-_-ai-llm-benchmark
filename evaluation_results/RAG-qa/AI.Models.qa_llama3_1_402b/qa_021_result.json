  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant to the issue of the notification bell not being available, but it includes an unnecessary link to XWiki syntax documentation, which slightly detracts from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior but does not provide information on enabling notifications in the wiki settings.' Similarly, the second node 'lists various notification settings and customization options but does not mention enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file.' All subsequent nodes also fail to address the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki, which is the core of the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete mismatch between the expected information and the available context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the 'xwiki.properties' file or setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true'.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not address enabling notifications via `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` as in the expected output. It instead focuses on troubleshooting the notification display issue and includes unrelated details about checking extensions and permissions."
