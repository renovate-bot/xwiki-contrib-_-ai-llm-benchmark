    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the issue without any irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and settings for notifications, but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki or setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`. The second node talks about overriding default notification templates and installation instructions for extensions, but does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki or setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention activating notifications in the wiki settings or modifying `xwiki.properties`, nor does it provide instructions for setting the `notifications.enabled` property in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
