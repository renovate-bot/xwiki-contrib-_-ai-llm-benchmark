  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue with the notification bell, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly address the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior', which does not relate to 'enabling notifications in the wiki settings'. Similarly, the second node provides 'links to various notification settings and customization options', but again does not mention 'enabling notifications in the wiki settings'. The third node lists 'various notification preferences and macros', which are not about 'enabling notifications in the wiki settings'. The fourth node describes 'the notification application and its features', but lacks information on 'enabling notifications in the wiki settings'. Lastly, the fifth node discusses 'RSS feeds and notification settings', which also does not address 'enabling notifications in the wiki settings'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 1st node in retrieval context supports the mention of 'notifications' and 'wiki' in sentence 1 of the expected output, there is no information in the nodes about 'xwiki.properties' or setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which are crucial for sentence 2.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the xwiki.properties file or the specific property `notifications.enabled`."
