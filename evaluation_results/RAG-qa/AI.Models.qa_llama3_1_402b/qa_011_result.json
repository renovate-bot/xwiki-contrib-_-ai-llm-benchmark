  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'editing the xwiki.properties file' to enable notifications, is ranked last (6th), while the irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing 'custom notification filters' (1st) and 'alert menu and notification display' (2nd), are ranked higher. This misranking of relevant information contributes to the low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the general topic of enabling notifications is supported by the 5th node in the retrieval context, there is no specific mention of the setting `notifications.enabled` or the file `xwiki.properties`, which are key details in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`."
