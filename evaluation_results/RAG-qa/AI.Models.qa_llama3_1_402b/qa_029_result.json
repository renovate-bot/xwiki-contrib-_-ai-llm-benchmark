  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the main content addresses the process of revoking script rights for a space admin, but it includes repetitive irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node in the retrieval context is irrelevant, discussing 'language preferences and translations in XWiki,' which should be ranked lower than the second node that directly addresses 'programming and script rights' relevant to the input. Additionally, the fourth and fifth nodes are also irrelevant, focusing on 'checking access rights programmatically' and 'executing code with user rights,' which do not pertain to denying script rights to an administrator. However, the second and third nodes are correctly identified as relevant, discussing 'programming rights' and 'ADMIN rights,' contributing to the current score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context, demonstrating a perfect match. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that certain rights like ADMIN are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that rights implied by admin cannot be refused as in the expected output."
