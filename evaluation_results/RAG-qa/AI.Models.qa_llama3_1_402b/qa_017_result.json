  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'various OpenID Connect endpoints and configuration properties' but lacks information on group synchronization. The second node talks about 'different authentication methods and extensions' without addressing group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The third node mentions 'OpenID Connect authentication and provides links to configuration guides' but does not cover group synchronization. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect authenticator' without information on group synchronization. Lastly, the fifth node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator' but omits group synchronization details. All these nodes should be ranked lower as they do not address the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context. The retrieval context lacks any mention of key concepts such as 'Gruppensynchronisierung', 'xwiki.properties', or the specific configuration steps related to OpenID Connect provider integration with XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about configuring group synchronization in xwiki.properties, such as oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, or oidc.groups.mapping."
