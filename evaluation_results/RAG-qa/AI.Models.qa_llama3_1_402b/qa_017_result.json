  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node mentioning 'Group synchronization' and providing a link to the relevant section is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node which provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator without detailing group synchronization, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate guide.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and the xwiki.properties file but lacks detailed steps and configuration examples found in the expected output."
