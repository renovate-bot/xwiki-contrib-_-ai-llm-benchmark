  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the query about not receiving notifications in XWiki without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, providing information on how to follow a user to receive notifications, which is part of the expected output. However, the second node discusses filters and settings related to notifications but does not directly address enabling notifications or subscribing to pages or users, and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node talks about getting a notification RSS feed and settings, which does not provide information on enabling notifications or subscribing to specific content, and should also be ranked lower. The fourth node is relevant as it explains different ways to be notified in XWiki, aligning with the expected output. Lastly, the fifth node is about the 'What's New' application for news updates, which is not directly related to enabling notifications or subscribing to content in XWiki, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some sentences, such as those about using the 'alert' menu (supported by node 4 in retrieval context) and following users (supported by node 1 in retrieval context), are well-supported, key details like enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and subscribing to pages or users are not covered by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers following users and notification settings but lacks specific details on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching pages.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output partially aligns with the expected output by mentioning the need to watch pages or users for notifications. However, it lacks specific instructions about enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties' and does not cover all methods of watching locations and users described in the expected output. It introduces additional troubleshooting steps not found in the expected output."
