  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output incorrectly states that notifications are not received until application types are enabled, whereas the retrieval context indicates that certain application types are enabled by default. Additionally, the actual output inaccurately claims that users don't receive notifications about their own activity by default, while the retrieval context specifies that this is true only for XWiki 14.1+ unless the event targets them explicitly.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first and fourth nodes in the retrieval context are relevant, providing information on how to follow a user to receive notifications and outlining different ways to receive notifications in XWiki. However, the second node discusses filters and settings related to hidden pages and personal events, which does not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node provides information about RSS feeds and notification settings but does not address enabling notifications or subscribing to specific pages or users, and the fifth node mentions the 'What's New' application, which is not directly related to setting up or troubleshooting notifications in XWiki. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than they should be, affecting the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context supports some aspects like enabling notifications through the alert menu (sentence 4), following a user (sentence 5), and viewing watched users in the network tab (sentence 6), it lacks information on enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` (sentence 2) and subscribing to pages or users (sentence 3).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on following users and notification settings but lacks details on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching pages."
