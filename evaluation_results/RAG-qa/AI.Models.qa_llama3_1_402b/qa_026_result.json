  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response addresses the main question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant URLs that do not directly relate to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'various authentication methods for XWiki, including OIDC,' but does not provide information about customizing user profile fields or mapping them. Similarly, the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator for XWiki,' but does not address customizing user profile fields or mapping them.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly aligns with the expected output, covering all key points and steps in detail.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about customizing user profile fields or mapping them in the xwiki.properties file."
