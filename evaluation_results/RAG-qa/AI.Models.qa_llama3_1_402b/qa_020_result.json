  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the output addresses the main query about configuring team permissions in XWiki, but it includes several irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the specific task of setting permissions, which prevents the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses XWiki's database support and programming features, which are not relevant to configuring access controls for teams. The second node is about the Notifications Application in XWiki and does not relate to team access control configuration. The third node explains Nested Pages and subwikis in XWiki, which does not directly address the question of configuring team-specific access controls. The fourth node briefly mentions managing users and groups, but it does not provide specific information on setting access rights for teams as required by the input question. The fifth node is about group synchronization and customization in XWiki, which is not directly related to configuring team-specific access rights as asked in the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the retrieval context lacks any mention of steps for achieving access control, creating groups, setting rights, or inheriting permissions in XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about setting access controls, creating groups, or managing rights in XWiki, which are key elements in the expected output."
