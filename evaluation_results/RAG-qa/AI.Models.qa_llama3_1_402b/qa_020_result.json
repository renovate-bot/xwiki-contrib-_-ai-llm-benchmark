    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer provides useful information but includes multiple irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific configuration question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring team-specific access and editing rights in XWiki. For instance, the first node discusses actions like creating children pages and changing page access rights, but does not provide specific steps for the required configuration. Similarly, the second node talks about wikis and panels, but does not address team-specific access needs.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, setting wiki-wide or area-specific rights, or inheriting rights for child pages as described in the expected output."
