  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, with only a minor irrelevant mention of LDAP authenticator that slightly detracts from the focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly claims that setting the session cookie on a top-level domain will encompass all wikis of the farm, while the retrieval context clarifies that this approach will not work if the domains are very different.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', which do not relate to enabling user accounts automatically with OpenID Connect. The second node talks about 'container authentication and LDAP', which also does not mention the specific configuration needed for OpenID Connect. The third node provides general information about OpenID Connect but omits the specific property `oidc.enableUser` required for automatic user activation. The fourth node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension without addressing user account activation settings. Lastly, the fifth node is focused on 'LDAP and Active Directory integration', which is not relevant to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the first sentence of the expected output is partially supported by the information in the 1st node in retrieval context, which mentions OpenID Connect and xwiki.properties. The rest of the sentences, which provide specific instructions and guarantees, do not have corresponding details in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention adjusting the xwiki.properties file or setting oidc.enableUser to true for activating user accounts on first login."
