    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the main question, but it includes an unnecessary mention of the XWiki RESTful API.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'does not provide information on configuring user activation', the second node 'does not address the specific configuration needed for OpenID Connect user activation', and the third node 'does not mention the specific property `oidc.enableUser` or the xwiki.properties file'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain specific information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `oidc.enableUser` to `true`."
