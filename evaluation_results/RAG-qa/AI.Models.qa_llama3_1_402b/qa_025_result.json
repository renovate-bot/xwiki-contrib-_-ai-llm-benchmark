  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the response addresses the main question about configuring OpenID Connect for automatic user activation, but it includes irrelevant details about LDAP authentication, which are not related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly suggests setting `xwiki.authentication.createuser` to `empty` for automatic user account creation, while the retrieval context only specifies that it must be set in xwiki.cfg, without mentioning the `empty` value.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', which is unrelated to the automatic enabling of user accounts with OpenID Connect. The second node focuses on 'container authentication' and mentions OpenID Connect but lacks information on enabling user accounts automatically. The third node describes the 'OpenID Connect Authenticator extension' without addressing the automatic enabling of user accounts. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', which does not pertain to the required configuration. Lastly, the fifth node is about 'LDAP and Active Directory integration', which is unrelated to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while nodes in the retrieval context mention 'OpenId Connect Authentication' and 'xwiki.properties', they do not specifically address adding or updating the 'oidc.enableUser' property, saving the file, or restarting XWiki, which are crucial steps mentioned in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention adjusting the xwiki.properties file or the specific property oidc.enableUser for automatic user account activation via OpenID Connect.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output suggests modifying `xwiki.cfg` with `xwiki.authentication.createuser=empty`, whereas the expected output requires modifying `xwiki.properties` with `oidc.enableUser=true`. The actual output also includes irrelevant information about LDAP and version variability."
