  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer largely addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the first node discusses 'LDAP configuration' and does not mention token-based authentication, which is irrelevant to the input, yet it is ranked higher than the second node that explains 'Authorized Applications', relevant to using tokens for authentication. Additionally, the third node focuses on 'OpenID Connect scopes', unrelated to token-based authentication, but is ranked higher than the fourth node that describes the use of JWT for authenticating users, directly supporting the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key aspects of the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as the use of JWTs and specific configuration steps, there are gaps in the context regarding the generation of JWT tokens with required claims and the inclusion of the token in the 'Authorization' header.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes details about configuring authorized applications and enabling the token authenticator, which aligns with the expected answer. However, it lacks specific mention of JWT claims and the requirement to include the token in the 'Authorization' header."
