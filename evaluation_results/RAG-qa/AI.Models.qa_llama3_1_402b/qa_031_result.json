  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the main content effectively addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but the presence of multiple irrelevant source link statements prevents the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context is relevant, describing the configuration of 'Authorized Applications,' which pertains to using tokens for authentication, and the fourth node is also relevant, providing a description of the extension for authentication with JWTs. However, the first node, ranked highest, is irrelevant as it focuses on LDAP configuration without mentioning token-based authentication, and the third node discusses OpenID Connect scopes, which are not directly related to token-based authentication with JWTs. Additionally, the fifth node talks about general authentication mechanisms without specifically addressing token-based authentication.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several aspects of the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, such as the use of JWT for authentication and configuration of authorized applications, there are missing details like generating a JWT token with specific claims and including it in the 'Authorization' header.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and using JWTs, which aligns with the expected answer. However, details about specific JWT claims and the use of Ed25519 keys are missing.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions LLM Application Authenticator but lacks details on JWT claims, signing, and limitations noted in expected output. It also discusses OIDC and custom authenticators, which are irrelevant."
