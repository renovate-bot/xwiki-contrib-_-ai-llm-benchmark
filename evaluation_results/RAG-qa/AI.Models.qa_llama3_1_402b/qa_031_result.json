  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the answer provides some relevant information about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output incorrectly claims that an access token is needed to authenticate the user in XWiki, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node describing the configuration of 'Authorized Applications' (rank 2) is ranked lower than an irrelevant node discussing various claims accessed via an access token (rank 1). Additionally, other irrelevant nodes discussing general information about a security module (rank 3), cookie protection (rank 4), and user profile rights (rank 5) are also ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because the retrieval context only partially matches the expected output. Specifically, it mentions configuring properties for 'Authorized Applications' (related to sentence 2), but it does not cover key aspects such as 'Token-based authentication for the LLM Application extension', 'signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT)', or the detailed steps for enabling and using the token authenticator (related to sentences 1, 3, 4, and 5).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions 'Authorized Applications' and configuring properties like title, URL, and public key but lacks details on enabling the token authenticator, JWT claims, and token usage."
