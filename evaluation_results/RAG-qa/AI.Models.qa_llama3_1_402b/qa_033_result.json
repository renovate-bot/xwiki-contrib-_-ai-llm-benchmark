  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the answer partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but the repeated irrelevant URL provided does not directly address the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'properties of a collection object and methods for managing collections,' which is unrelated to user authentication with access tokens. Similarly, the second node describes 'various claims that can be requested by an access token at the UserInfo endpoint,' which does not address the process of authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to token-based authentication, JWT, or the specific steps and requirements mentioned in the expected output."
