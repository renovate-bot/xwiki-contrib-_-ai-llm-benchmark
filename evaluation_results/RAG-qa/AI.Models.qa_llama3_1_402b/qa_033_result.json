  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes source links that are not directly related to the topic, slightly reducing its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'upgrading XWiki' without mentioning 'user authentication or token-based authentication'. The second node talks about 'features related to users and rights' but does not 'specifically address token-based authentication or JWT'. The third node mentions 'rights management' and links to 'authentication guides', yet it does not 'directly address the use of access tokens for authentication'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete lack of relevant information.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to token-based authentication or JWT, which are central to the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output lacks mention of JWT, Ed25519, xwiki.authentication.authclass, and specifics about configuring applications, which are key facts in the expected output."
