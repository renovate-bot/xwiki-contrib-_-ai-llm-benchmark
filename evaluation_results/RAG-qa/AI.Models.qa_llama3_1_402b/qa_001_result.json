  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly states that the Alerts Application must be installed and enabled for the Notifications Application to display the Bell icon, whereas the retrieval context only mentions the Notifications Application contributing content to the Alert menu.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`, is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes discussing 'getting a notification RSS feed and settings for notifications' (first node), 'overriding default notification templates and installation instructions' (second node), 'the 'Clear All' link and grouping of notifications' (fourth node), and 'the notifications menu and the bell icon' (fifth node) are ranked higher or close to the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications in xwiki.properties but does not explicitly state setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true'."
