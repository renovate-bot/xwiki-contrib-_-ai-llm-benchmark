  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the response is mostly relevant to the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it includes a source link that does not directly address the specific issue, slightly reducing its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'customization of page templates, internationalization, and other features unrelated to notification settings.' The second node is about 'administrating wiki features and does not mention notification settings or user activity.' The third node lists 'various XWiki extensions and applications, none of which relate to enabling notifications for user activity.' These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than any relevant information, leading to a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user profile options, which are central to the expected output."
