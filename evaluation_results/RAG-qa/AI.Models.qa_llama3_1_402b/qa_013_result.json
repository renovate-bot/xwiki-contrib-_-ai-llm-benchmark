    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.72 because while the answer provides some relevant information, it includes multiple URLs that do not directly address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'token generation and JWT claims', which is unrelated to notifications for user activity. Similarly, the second node talks about 'database migration and invalid extensions', which does not pertain to user notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about user notification settings or the ability to disable filters in the user profile."
