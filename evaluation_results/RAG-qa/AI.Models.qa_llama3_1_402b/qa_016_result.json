  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response is highly relevant to the input question, providing useful information on mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. However, the inclusion of 'Beispiel:' is slightly irrelevant as it doesn't add value to the explanation, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect provider configuration', the second node is about 'container authentication and other authentication methods like LDAP and Active Directory', the third node provides a 'general description of the OpenID Connect Authenticator and its capabilities', the fourth node is about 'the OpenID Connect Authenticator's features and installation', and the fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension'. None of these nodes address 'user profile field mapping or customization', which is the focus of the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context supports the general idea of customizing user profile fields using 'xwiki.properties' and 'oidc.user.mapping', it lacks specific examples and instructions found in sentences 2 to 5 of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about customizing user profile fields using `xwiki.properties` and `oidc.user.mapping`, which are essential details in the expected output."
