  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints' without mentioning 'user profile field mapping or customization'. The second node provides information on 'container authentication and other authentication methods' but does not address 'mapping user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider'. The third node offers a 'general description of the OpenID Connect Authenticator and its configuration guides' without mentioning 'customizing user profile fields'. The fourth node describes the 'OpenID Connect Authenticator extension's details and compatibility' but does not address 'user profile field mapping'. Finally, the fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension' but does not mention 'user profile field customization or mapping'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the nodes in retrieval context mention 'xwiki.properties' and 'oidc.user.mapping', which support the customization of user profile fields (sentences 1 and 2), they lack specific examples and instructions found in sentences 3 and 4, such as mapping custom properties, replacing variables, and restarting XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties` as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The Actual Output acknowledges customization of user profile fields from OpenID Connect, aligning with the Expected Output. However, it lacks specific configuration details such as `xwiki.properties` and `oidc.user.mapping` mentioned in the Expected Output, suggesting editing `xwiki.cfg` instead, which is inconsistent."
