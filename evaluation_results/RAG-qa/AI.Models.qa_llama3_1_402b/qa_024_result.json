    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response mostly addresses how to disable notifications, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly help with the question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. Great job on maintaining perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while the retrieval context nodes support most of the expected output, such as automatic page watching and notification preferences (related to nodes in retrieval context), it lacks information about being notified of changes on your work, which affects the overall alignment.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, which aligns with the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit mention of modifying settings in the user profile for 'Suivi automatique des pages'."
