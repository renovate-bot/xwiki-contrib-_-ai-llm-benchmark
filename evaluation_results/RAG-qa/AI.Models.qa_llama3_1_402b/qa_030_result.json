  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the question about configuring access rights in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access control for team spaces. For instance, the first node discusses the automatic creation of spaces and WebHome pages, the second node lists various macros and their uses, and the third node explains the parent/child relationship and nested pages. None of these nodes provide information on access control or permissions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, defining rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages."
