  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output incorrectly states that you need to use the 'Own event filter' switch to filter out events triggered by yourself, while the retrieval context indicates that such notifications are not received by default.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.37 because irrelevant nodes like the first node ('enabling and disabling the notification module and email notifications') and the second node ('getting a notification RSS feed and customizing notification settings') are ranked higher than relevant nodes like the third node ('Watch and custom filters') and the fifth node ('Choosing the default auto-watched mode').",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only the first two sentences in the expected output are supported by the 2nd node in the retrieval context, while the last two sentences are not explicitly mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions settings and filters but lacks specific details about automatic page watching and deleting filters."
