  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about disabling notifications in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and enabling/disabling notification types,' but it does not address 'disabling notifications for pages you are not interested in.' Similarly, the second node talks about 'following a user and default watch settings,' which also does not provide information on how to disable notifications for unwanted pages. Each subsequent node continues to miss the specific requirement of disabling notifications for pages you are not interested in.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while nodes in the retrieval context support the information about default page watching settings (sentence 1), accessing notification settings (sentence 3), and managing custom filters (sentence 4), there is no support for being notified about changes on your work (sentence 2).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings, but lacks details on automatic page watching and deleting notification filters."
