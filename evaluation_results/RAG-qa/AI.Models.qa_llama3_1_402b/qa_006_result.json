  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the answer mostly addresses how to customize user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki, but it includes a source link and a vague statement that do not directly contribute to the solution.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user', is ranked first. This directly addresses the input question about customizing user profile fields. The irrelevant nodes, such as the second node focusing on 'scopes and response types for OpenID Connect' and the third node discussing 'endpoints and custom HTTP headers', are correctly ranked lower as they do not pertain to user profile field customization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context supports the mapping of custom properties using `oidc.user.mapping` as mentioned in sentences 2 and 3 of the expected output, it lacks details on replacing placeholders with actual values and the steps to save and restart XWiki as described in sentences 4 and 5.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains detailed instructions on mapping user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property, including examples that match the expected output, and confirms the need to save and restart XWiki."
