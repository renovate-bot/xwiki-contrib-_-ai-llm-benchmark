  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the response includes irrelevant links that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it still partially addresses the main concern.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context is ranked first and directly addresses the input question by stating, 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' which is precisely what the user is asking about. Great job on getting it spot on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the ability to change this setting, aligning with the expected output. However, it lacks specific mention of the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section."
