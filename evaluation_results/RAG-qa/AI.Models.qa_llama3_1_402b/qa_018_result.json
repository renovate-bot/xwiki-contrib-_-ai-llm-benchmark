  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the input regarding upload restrictions, but the inclusion of multiple source links that do not directly address the query slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'trusted domains and PDF export customization,' which are 'not relevant to configuring attachment upload restrictions,' and should be ranked lower. The second node, about 'ODT export and PDF export support,' does not relate to 'setting MIME types or size limits for attachments,' and should also be ranked lower. The third node lists 'various macros and features unrelated to attachment upload settings,' which should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes. The fourth and fifth nodes, which include links to 'Size Limit' and 'Mimetype Restriction,' and provide 'detailed steps on setting the maximum size of an attachment,' are directly relevant and should be ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context provides detailed support for the steps related to configuring the maximum attachment size (sentences 8-14), it lacks information on configuring MIME types in `xwiki.properties` (sentences 2-7).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions but lacks specific details about configuring xwiki.properties or setting 10 MB limit."
