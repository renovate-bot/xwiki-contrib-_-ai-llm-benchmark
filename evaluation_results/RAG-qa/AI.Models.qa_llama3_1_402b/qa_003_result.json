  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output claims enabling notifications for your own actions in XWiki will enable notifications for all users for the selected notification types, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context discuss various aspects of notifications in XWiki but none address enabling notifications for one's own actions. For example, the first node discusses how to get a notification RSS feed and general notification settings, while the second node lists various notification settings and customization options. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context only partially supports the expected output. Specifically, the 1st sentence in the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the 2nd sentence about disabling the filter in 'Advanced filtering options' is not mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and the ability to enable/disable notifications, but it lacks specific details about disabling the filter for one's own activity and the 'Advanced filtering options' section."
