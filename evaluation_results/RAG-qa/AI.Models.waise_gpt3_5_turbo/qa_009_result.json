  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the answer contains useful information related to XWiki permissions, but it includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the 'Script' right can be denied for the space administrator role, while the retrieval context clarifies that the 'Script' right is denied on sub-wikis by default and the priority order for rights is deny > allow > no setting.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses the 'Script' right in XWiki without addressing how to deny it to a space administrator. The second node is about checking access rights programmatically, which is not related to denying script rights to a space administrator. The third node talks about rights conversion, excluding spaces and pages, without addressing the question. The fourth node focuses on using the checkAccess() method for access control, which does not provide information about denying script rights to a space administrator. Lastly, the fifth node lists various rights and their properties in XWiki but does not specifically address the query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context, specifically by the 5th node, indicating that admin rights and rights implied by admin right cannot be denied."
