  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the response partially addresses the configuration of OpenID Connect in XWiki, but includes irrelevant information about LDAP Authenticator, browser cookies, and a general offer for further assistance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly states that the configuration key `xwiki.authentication.authclass` should be defined in the `xwiki.cfg` file, whereas the retrieval context specifies it should be defined in the `xwiki.properties` file.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses container authentication and various authentication methods but does not provide information about enabling user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect. Similarly, the second node provides a general description of the OpenID Connect Authenticator without mentioning the specific configuration needed. The third node is about LDAP configuration, which is irrelevant to the query. The fourth node talks about in-wiki configuration but misses the specific property needed (`oidc.enableUser`). Finally, the fifth node discusses different authentication mechanisms supported by XWiki without providing the required configuration details.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context mentions 'xwiki.properties' and configuring properties for OIDC, it lacks specific instructions, property details, and steps mentioned in the expected output."
