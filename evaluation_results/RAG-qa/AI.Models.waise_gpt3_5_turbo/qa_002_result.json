  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the provided URL link without context does not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications. However, the rest of the response is relevant and helpful.",
    "Faithfulness": "Fantastic job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions in the actual output, indicating it is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.87 because the relevant nodes are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. However, some irrelevant nodes, such as the third node ('how to mark notifications as read') and the fourth node ('focuses on the Clear All link'), appear before some relevant nodes, like the fifth node ('how to select types of notifications'), which reduces the overall score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.62 because while the retrieval context covers some aspects like enabling notifications and following users (nodes 1, 2, and 5), it lacks information about subscribing to pages or users and the 'network' tab in the user profile."
