  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the provided URL does not directly address the specific requirement of ensuring only image or PDF files of a maximum size of 10 MB can be uploaded as attachments. However, the response still contains some relevant information.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'various system filters and preferences', which is not related to configuring file upload restrictions. The second node lists 'various image files and their URLs', which is also unrelated to the input question about setting file upload restrictions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not provide any relevant information or steps related to configuring allowed MIME types or setting the maximum attachment size as described in the expected output."
