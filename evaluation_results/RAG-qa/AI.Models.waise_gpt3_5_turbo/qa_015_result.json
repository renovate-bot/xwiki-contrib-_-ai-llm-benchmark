    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but lacks specific settings for automatic user activation. The second node describes capabilities and installation details but misses the required configuration changes. The third node lists dependencies which are not related to the query. The fourth node mentions endpoints and other features but does not address the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context."
