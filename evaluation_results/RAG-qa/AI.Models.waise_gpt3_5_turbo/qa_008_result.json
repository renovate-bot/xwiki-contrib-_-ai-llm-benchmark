    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information on setting restrictions for attachment types and sizes, but it briefly mentions clearing the browser's cache, which is not directly related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring complete alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The relevant node, which discusses setting limits on the maximum size of an attachment in the XWikiPreferences document, is appropriately ranked first.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all the instructions in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
