    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions `xwiki.properties` and includes configuration details, is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes that provide general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, list dependencies, or mention endpoints and additional features are ranked higher (first, second, fourth, and fifth). These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are accurately supported by the information in node 3 in the retrieval context. Great job!"
