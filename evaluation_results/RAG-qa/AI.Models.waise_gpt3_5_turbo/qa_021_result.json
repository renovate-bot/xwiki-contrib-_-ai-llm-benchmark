  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and addresses the issue about the notification bell not being available even with the extension installed.",
    "Faithfulness": "Great job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node 'provides links and descriptions related to the Notifications Application but does not mention enabling notifications through `xwiki.properties` or provide troubleshooting steps.' Similarly, the second node 'lists dependencies for the Notifications Application but does not address the issue of enabling notifications or the specific property `notifications.enabled`.' These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the supportive context only partially aligns with the expected output, specifically with the first sentence, while the second sentence lacks direct support from the nodes in the retrieval context."
