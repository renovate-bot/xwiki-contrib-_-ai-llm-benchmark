    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the provided URL does not directly address the question about configuring permissions in XWiki. However, the rest of the content is relevant and useful.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring team access rights in XWiki. For example, the first node discusses spaces with WebHome pages but lacks information on access rights, and the second node talks about actions after running a migrator, which is unrelated to team access configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context."
