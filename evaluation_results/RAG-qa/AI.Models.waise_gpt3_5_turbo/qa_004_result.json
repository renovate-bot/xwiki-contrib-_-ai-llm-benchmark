  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about disabling unwanted notifications. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying true to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.42 because irrelevant nodes ranked 1st, 2nd, and 5th discuss 'Clear All' link, administrator-level email notifications, and default notification templates respectively, which do not address disabling notifications or modifying notification settings. Relevant nodes ranked 3rd and 4th mention 'Advanced filtering options' and 'auto-watched mode,' which are pertinent to changing notification settings in the user profile.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some sentences in the expected output can be linked to nodes in the retrieval context (like sentences 1 and 3 to node 4), other sentences (like sentences 2 and 4) cannot be attributed to any node in the retrieval context."
