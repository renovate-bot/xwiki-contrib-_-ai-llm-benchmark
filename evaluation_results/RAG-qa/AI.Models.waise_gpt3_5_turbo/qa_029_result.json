    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.60 because the output includes multiple irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific action of refusing script rights to a space admin. However, the score is not lower because the output may still contain some useful information related to the topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node does not address whether an administrator's rights can be refused, the second node lists various rights without addressing the specific question, and the third node is about checking access rights in different scenarios but does not address the refusal of script rights to an administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output, specifically confirming that admin rights cannot be refused."
