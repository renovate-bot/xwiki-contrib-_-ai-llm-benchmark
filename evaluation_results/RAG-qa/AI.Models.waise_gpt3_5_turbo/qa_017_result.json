    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) that specifically addresses group synchronization by mentioning the `oidc.groups.mapping` property and the `xwiki.properties` file is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node provides a general description and links to various resources but lacks specific steps or details on setting up group synchronization, and the second node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, which is not relevant to the specific process of configuring group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.36 because, while the retrieval context nodes mention key properties like `xwiki.properties`, `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, they lack specific instructions and examples for configuration, as well as steps for editing and saving the file."
