  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly claims that custom group synchronization in a listener can be used to map additional user profile fields, whereas the retrieval context specifies it is only for group synchronization.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node (rank 2) that lists available variables and provides an example of how to use them is ranked lower than the irrelevant nodes, such as the first node which discusses group synchronization and customization, and the third node which talks about in-wiki configuration and user cookie configurations.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, demonstrating precise and comprehensive alignment."
