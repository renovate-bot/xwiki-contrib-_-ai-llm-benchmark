  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant and addresses the main question. However, it includes a vague statement that does not provide specific steps or detailed information, which slightly reduces its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node (fifth node) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, its developer, and installation information, which does not provide any information on customizing user profile fields. Similarly, the second node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, which is not relevant to the customization of user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because the retrieval context covers the mapping of user profile fields and provides examples similar to those in sentences 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the expected output, but it does not mention saving the 'xwiki.properties' file and restarting XWiki as stated in sentence 5."
