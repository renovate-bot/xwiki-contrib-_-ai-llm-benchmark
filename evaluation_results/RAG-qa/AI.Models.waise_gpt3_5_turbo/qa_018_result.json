  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the answer provides some relevant information about file upload restrictions, but it includes multiple URL links without context, which do not address the specific question about ensuring only images or PDF files under 10 MB are uploaded.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which provides steps to set the maximum size of an attachment, is relevant and correctly ranked higher. However, the first node, which only provides links to various size limits and restrictions without detailing the steps needed, is ranked too high. Additionally, nodes 3, 4, and 5, which do not provide relevant information on configuring attachment size or MIME type restrictions, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while many instructions align well with nodes in the retrieval context, introductory statements and section headers do not have corresponding matches."
