  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the actual output provides some useful information on configuring permissions in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant statements that are just URLs without direct information.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes are highly relevant, providing detailed information on XWiki's permission system and setting permissions. However, the second node, ranked second, is less relevant as it discusses spaces and sub-pages without addressing permissions. The fourth node, ranked fourth, focuses on advanced editing modes, which is not pertinent to the query. The fifth node, ranked fifth, talks about enabling/disabling statistics, which is unrelated to setting access control or permissions, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while many parts of the expected output can be linked to nodes in the retrieval context, some sentences are summaries and not directly attributable to any specific part of the retrieval context."
