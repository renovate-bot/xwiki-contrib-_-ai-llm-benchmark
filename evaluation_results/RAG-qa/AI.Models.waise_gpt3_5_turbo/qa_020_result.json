    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the output contains relevant information about configuring permissions in XWiki, but it also includes multiple irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'creating a RESTful API resource in XWiki,' which does not address the question of access control configuration. Similarly, the second node contains 'an image and a link about managing users and groups' but lacks specific instructions on configuring access control. This pattern continues across all nodes, indicating that no relevant information was retrieved.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context."
