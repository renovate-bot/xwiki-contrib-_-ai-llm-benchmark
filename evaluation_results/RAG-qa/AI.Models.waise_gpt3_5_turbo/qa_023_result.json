    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer partially addresses the question but includes irrelevant information about XWiki syntax documentation and an unrelated URL.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because while the first and fourth nodes are relevant and ranked correctly, the second, third, and fifth nodes are irrelevant and should be ranked lower. The second node 'does not specifically address the issue of receiving notifications for one's own activity,' the third node 'describes how to get an RSS feed for notifications, which is not relevant,' and the fifth node 'does not specifically address the issue' either.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, showing a perfect match."
