    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.70 because while the answer addresses the question, it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not pertain to denying script rights to an area administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying true to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses validation patterns and programming code, which does not relate to the question about denying script rights. Similarly, the second node contains image links and project references, unrelated to script rights in XWiki. The nodes should be ranked lower as they do not address the issue of script rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything related to 'Admin-Recht' or the ability to deny rights implied by admin rights."
