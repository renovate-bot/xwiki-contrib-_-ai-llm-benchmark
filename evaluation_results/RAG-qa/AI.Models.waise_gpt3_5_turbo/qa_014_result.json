    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.58 because the actual output included multiple irrelevant URLs that did not address the question about how to disable notifications. However, the score is not lower because some relevant information was still provided.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query about disabling notifications. For example, the first node is about 'customizing page templates, adding menus, and modifying CSS files,' which should be ranked lower. Similarly, the second node discusses 'adding and removing keyboard shortcuts using JavaScript,' and the third node is about 'applications, extensions, and creating applications within XWiki,' both of which are not related to managing notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
