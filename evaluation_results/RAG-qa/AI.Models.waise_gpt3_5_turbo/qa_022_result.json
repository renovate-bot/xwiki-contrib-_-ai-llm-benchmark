  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help with the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'does not provide any direct information about enabling notifications or following pages/users.' Similarly, the second node 'talks about getting a notification RSS feed and the Notifications Macro, which is not relevant to enabling notifications or following pages/users.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the key points in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, such as enabling notifications, following pages or users, and viewing the list of users followed. However, the specific property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` is not mentioned in the retrieval context."
