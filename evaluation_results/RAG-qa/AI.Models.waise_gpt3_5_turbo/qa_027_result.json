  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response provides some relevant information about the configuration process, but includes several irrelevant statements about customization and templates, which do not directly address the group synchronization configuration.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the first and fifth nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and ranked correctly, providing specific steps for configuring group synchronization. However, the second, third, and fourth nodes, which discuss general descriptions, dependencies, and troubleshooting, are irrelevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.44 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring group synchronization and modifying the xwiki.properties file, it lacks details on replacing specific values, configuring the oidc.groups.separator property, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance."
