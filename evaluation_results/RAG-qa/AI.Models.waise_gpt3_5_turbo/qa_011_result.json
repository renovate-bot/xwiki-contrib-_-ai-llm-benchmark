    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the issue without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node mainly describes the functionality of the Alert menu and how notifications are displayed and interacted with, but it does not address enabling notifications, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention the need to enable notifications in the wiki or provide instructions to set `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
