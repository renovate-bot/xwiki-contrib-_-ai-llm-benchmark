    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the output contains multiple irrelevant links that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications. However, it still provides some information that might be of general interest.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node talks about 'customizing page templates, adding menus, and modifying CSS files,' while the input is about notifications. Similarly, the second node is focused on 'setting up languages and encoding for XWiki,' which does not relate to notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
