  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the output provides some relevant information about the 'Alert Notification' extension, but includes URLs that do not directly address the specific issue mentioned in the input.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node is about the functionality of the notification system, the second node discusses the display and functionality of the bell icon, the third node is related to the menu and additional features, and the fourth node lists dependencies for the extension. None of these nodes address enabling notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki or provide instructions on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
