    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the main response addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it includes irrelevant links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context discuss various aspects of notifications such as RSS feeds, notification preferences, customization options, overriding templates, and administrative settings, but none of them address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention that one doesn't receive notifications about one's own activity (sentence 1) or the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of one's notification settings in the user profile (sentence 2)."
