    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because while some relevant information might be present, a significant portion of the output includes URLs that do not address the specific question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfectly faithful alignment with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to notifications or user activity. For example, the first node is about 'Authorized Applications Configuration', the second node discusses 'Skins' and customization, and the third node is about 'Office Importer' and various extensions. None of these contexts mention notifications or user activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output discusses notification settings and advanced filter options, which are not covered in any of the nodes in the retrieval context."
