  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "Great job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions in the actual output. Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes provide direct and relevant information about configuring group synchronization by detailing the `xwiki.properties` file settings. However, the second, fourth, and fifth nodes, which are about general OpenID Connect authentication, dependencies, and various endpoints, do not address the specific steps for group synchronization and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context nodes provide some relevant information about configuring group synchronization and properties in the `xwiki.properties` file (as seen in sentences 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the expected output), they lack details on specific configurations and replacements (such as sentence 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10)."
