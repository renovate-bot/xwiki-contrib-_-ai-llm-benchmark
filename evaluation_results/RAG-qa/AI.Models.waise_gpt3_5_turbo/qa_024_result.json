  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the core information about disabling notifications is provided, but the inclusion of irrelevant URLs about XWiki syntax and the Notifications Application detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job keeping everything aligned!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.87 because the relevant nodes are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. However, the third node, which discusses 'getting an RSS feed for notifications' and is not relevant to disabling or managing notifications, should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes. Similarly, the fourth node, which talks about 'advanced settings like customizing email templates and creating global notification filters,' is also not directly relevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context covers the automatic addition of pages to the watchlist and notification settings, it lacks details on modifying 'Suivi automatique des pages' and 'Filtres personnalis\u00e9s'."
