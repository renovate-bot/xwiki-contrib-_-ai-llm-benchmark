  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the output contains incomplete and irrelevant statements that do not address the query about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, it is not lower because there may still be some relevant information present.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses how to get a notification RSS feed and general notification settings, but it does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context mentions the ability to enable or disable notification types (node 1), which relates to advanced filtering options in user settings (sentence 2). However, it does not cover that users do not receive notifications about their own activity unless explicitly targeted (sentence 1).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions notification settings and default behaviors but lacks specific details about disabling the filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section."
