  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.28 because the majority of the statements in the output are unrelated to the issue of the missing notification bell icon, focusing instead on various unrelated topics such as guides, Python functions, and notification settings in different contexts. This lack of relevance significantly lowers the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the sixth node, 'mentions editing the xwiki.properties file, which is relevant to enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.' However, it is ranked lower than five irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node 'discusses custom notification filters and their behavior, which does not relate to enabling notifications in the wiki settings,' and should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the expected output partially aligns with the retrieval context, specifically regarding editing the xwiki.properties file (node 6 in retrieval context), it lacks direct support for the specific mention of 'notifications.enabled' and setting it to 'true'.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not contain any relevant information about enabling notifications in the wiki settings as described in the expected output."
