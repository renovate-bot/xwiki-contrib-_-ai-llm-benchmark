  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of the unavailable bell icon, but it includes a source link that does not directly address this specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions that administrators can edit the xwiki.properties file to configure notification settings, is ranked sixth. This node should be ranked higher as it directly relates to enabling notifications. The first node discusses custom notification filters and their behavior, which is not related to enabling notifications in the wiki settings, and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the second node describes the notification bell and how notifications are displayed, but does not address enabling notifications, indicating it should also be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context mentions editing the xwiki.properties file, there is no specific mention of setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is a key part of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`."
