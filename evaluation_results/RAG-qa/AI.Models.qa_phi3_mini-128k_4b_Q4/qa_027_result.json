  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.16 because the majority of the output contains irrelevant statements that do not address the input about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The presence of numerous unrelated topics significantly lowers the relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly states that the 'OpenID Connect' extension can be downloaded from the Wikia extension repository or via FTP/SFTP, which is not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'group synchronization, including the use of the `oidc.groups.mapping` property', is ranked third. The first and second nodes focus on 'authentication management and OpenID Connect provider configuration' and 'container authentication', which do not mention group synchronization, and should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.83 because the retrieval context nodes provide relevant information for most of the expected output sentences, such as configuring group synchronization and mapping groups (nodes 1 and 3). However, it lacks details about saving the file and restarting the XWiki instance, which affects the completeness of the context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using 'oidc.groups.mapping', but lacks details on 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.separator'."
