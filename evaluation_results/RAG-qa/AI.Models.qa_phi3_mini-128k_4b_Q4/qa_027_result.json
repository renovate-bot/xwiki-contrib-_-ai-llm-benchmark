  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked third, directly addresses group synchronization by mentioning the claim 'xwiki_groups' and the 'oidc.groups.mapping' property, which are crucial for configuring group synchronization. However, it is ranked lower than two irrelevant nodes. The first node focuses on authentication management and endpoints configuration, and the second node discusses different authentication methods and extensions, neither of which address group synchronization with OpenID Connect. This misordering affects the score, preventing it from being higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the configuration of 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' as mentioned in sentences 3, 5, and 7 of the expected output, it lacks information on locating the 'xwiki.properties' file, providing specific examples, and saving changes as described in sentences 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using 'oidc.groups.mapping', but lacks details on 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.separator' properties or saving changes in 'xwiki.properties'.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output introduces concepts like `oidc.userinfoclaims` and custom group handlers not in expected output, lacks specific steps like setting `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.separator`, but mentions `oidc.groups.mapping` and testing configuration as expected."
