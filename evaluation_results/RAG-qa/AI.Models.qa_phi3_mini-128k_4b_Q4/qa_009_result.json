  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant statements that do not address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses programming rights and admin rights implications, but it does not address denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node lists various rights and their default states without mentioning the specific denial of script rights. The third node explains script rights and their default status but lacks information on denying them. The fourth node provides technical details about checking access rights but not about denying script rights. Lastly, the fifth node discusses converting rights and excluding pages or spaces, which is unrelated to denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, matching the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output is entirely unrelated to the expected output, containing irrelevant and incoherent content that does not address the topic of XWiki rights."
