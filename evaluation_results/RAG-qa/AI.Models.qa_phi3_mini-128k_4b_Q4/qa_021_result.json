  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response is mostly relevant to the input, addressing the issue with the notification feature. However, it includes links that are not directly related to resolving the specific problem, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior' but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The second node provides 'links to various notification settings and customizations' but does not mention enabling notifications through `xwiki.properties`. The third node lists 'various notification preferences and macros' but does not provide information on enabling notifications in the wiki. The fourth node describes 'the notifications menu and its features' but does not relate to enabling notifications in the wiki configuration. The fifth node explains 'RSS feeds and settings for notifications' but does not mention enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about enabling notifications via the 'xwiki.properties' file or setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true'.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output addresses issues with XWiki notifications but does not mention setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties` as in the expected output. It introduces additional troubleshooting steps not required by the expected output."
