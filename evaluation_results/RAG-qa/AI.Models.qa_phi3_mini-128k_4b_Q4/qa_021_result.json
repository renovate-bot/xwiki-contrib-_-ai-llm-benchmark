  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.02 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant and do not address the issue of the notification bell not being available, as highlighted by the numerous unrelated and nonsensical statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, discussing topics like 'getting an RSS feed of notifications' (first node), 'overriding default notification templates' (second node), 'Clear All link and default notification behaviors' (third node), 'custom notification filters and the watch feature' (fourth node), and 'various settings related to notifications' (fifth node), none of which address enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` to `true`."
