    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant with no irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', which is unrelated to enabling user accounts with OpenID Connect in XWiki. The second node is about 'container authentication' and mentions OpenID Connect, but does not address enabling user accounts automatically. The third node focuses on 'authentication providers and limitations', not on enabling user accounts automatically. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', which is not relevant to the configuration needed for enabling user accounts. Lastly, the fifth node is about 'LDAP and Active Directory integration', which does not relate to OpenID Connect or enabling user accounts automatically in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because while the 2nd node in the retrieval context mentions 'OpenId Connect Authentication' and 'xwiki.properties', which supports the context of adjusting the file for OpenID Connect in XWiki (sentence 1), the retrieval context lacks details on adding or updating specific properties (sentence 2), uncommenting and setting 'oidc.enableUser' to 'true' (sentence 3), saving the file and restarting XWiki (sentence 4), and the automatic activation of new user accounts (sentence 5).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention updating the xwiki.properties file or the specific property oidc.enableUser, which are crucial details in the expected output."
