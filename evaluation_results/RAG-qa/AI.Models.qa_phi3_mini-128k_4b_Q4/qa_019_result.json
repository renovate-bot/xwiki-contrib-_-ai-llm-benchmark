    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant statements that do not address the query about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. For example, the first node contains links to images and references, which are not relevant to the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about 'Rechte' or 'Admin-Recht' being denied or supported in XWiki, which is the main focus of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to rights or admin rights in XWiki."
