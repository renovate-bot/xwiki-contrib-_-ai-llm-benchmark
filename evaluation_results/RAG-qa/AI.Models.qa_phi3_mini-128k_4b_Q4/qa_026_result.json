  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because none of the statements in the actual output are relevant to the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki. The output contains numerous unrelated topics, such as setting up authentication systems and writing documents, which do not address the input query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints but lacks information on user profile field mapping or customization. The second node focuses on container authentication and other methods like LDAP and Active Directory, which are unrelated to the input query. The third node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension but does not address the specific need for user profile field mapping or customization. The fourth node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, which is not relevant to the input. Finally, the fifth node offers links to configuration guides but fails to mention mapping or customizing user profile fields in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 1st sentence of the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, the rest of the expected output, including the example mapping, instructions to replace variables, and the step to save and restart XWiki, are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions OpenID Connect and xwiki.properties but lacks details on customizing user profile fields and mapping as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not contain any relevant information related to the expected output. There is no mention of user profile field customization, OpenID Connect, or mapping properties in `xwiki.properties`. The content is unrelated and does not maintain the context or factual details of the expected output."
