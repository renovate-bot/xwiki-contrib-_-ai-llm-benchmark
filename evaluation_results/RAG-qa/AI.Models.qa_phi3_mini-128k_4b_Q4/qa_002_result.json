  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output incorrectly claims that user interaction is required before any activity triggers a notification in XWiki 15.5+, whereas the retrieval context does not mention this requirement.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, explaining 'how to follow a user to receive notifications', and the fourth node also provides 'an overview of different notification methods in XWiki'. However, the second node, ranked higher than the fourth, discusses 'filters and settings for notifications' without directly addressing enabling notifications, and the third node, also ranked higher than the fourth, mentions 'RSS feeds and notification settings' but lacks crucial information on enabling notifications. Additionally, the fifth node talks about the 'What's New' application, which is not directly related to the expected output.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while there are references in the nodes in retrieval context to clicking on the 'alert' menu, following a user, and the 'network' tab in the user profile (supporting sentences 4, 5, and 6), there is no mention of enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties`, subscribing to pages or users, or watching a page, its children, or an entire wiki (missing support for sentences 1, 2, and 3).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on following users and receiving notifications, but lacks details on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching pages or wikis.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties', watching pages or users, or the 'alert' menu. It includes additional information on notification types, RSS feeds, and software updates not in the expected output."
