    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context is ranked fourth, while the first three nodes are irrelevant. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, the second node offers links to configuration guides without specific instructions, and the third node discusses other authentication methods. The relevant information about modifying the 'xwiki.properties' file is not prioritized.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the 2nd sentence in the expected output can be related to the 2nd node in the retrieval context, while the rest of the sentences do not find any corresponding information in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
