  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect, with no irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', which is unrelated to enabling user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and installation instructions', but does not address the specific configuration needed. The third node describes 'compatibility and installation details', which do not pertain to user account activation configuration. The fourth node outlines 'various OpenID Connect endpoints and configurations', but does not mention the specific property 'oidc.enableUser' needed for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context nodes mention the xwiki.properties file and OpenID Connect settings, they do not provide details on updating specific properties, restarting the XWiki instance, or automatic activation of user accounts on first login, which are key elements in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about automatically activating user accounts with OpenID Connect by modifying the xwiki.properties file."
