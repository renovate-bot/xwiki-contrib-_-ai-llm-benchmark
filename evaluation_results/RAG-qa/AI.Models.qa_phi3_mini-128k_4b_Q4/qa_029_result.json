  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the provided link and statement do not address how to deny script rights to a space administrator, making the information partially irrelevant.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'default right settler additional policies,' which does not address the question about denying script rights to an administrator. The second node talks about 'executing tasks with user rights,' which is also not relevant. Similarly, the third node mentions the 'Scripting API and checking access rights,' but does not address the specific question. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context, perfectly matching the information provided.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context clearly states that rights implied by an admin right cannot be overridden by a denial at a lower level, matching the expected answer that admin rights cannot be refused."
