  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.04 because the output contains numerous irrelevant and convoluted statements that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses how to get a notification RSS feed and does not address notifications for one's own activity, while the second node provides a list of various notification-related links and settings but does not specifically address notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the 1st sentence in the expected output can be linked to the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the 2nd sentence cannot be attributed to any node in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions filtering own events and notification settings, but lacks details on disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es'."
