  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant statements that do not address the query about enabling notifications for personal actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked first, directly addresses the input question by stating 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' which is precisely what the input is about. The irrelevant nodes, which discuss topics like 'RSS feeds and general notification settings,' 'a list of links and sections related to notifications,' 'various notification preferences macros,' and 'technical aspects of notifications,' are all correctly ranked lower as they do not specifically address the issue of receiving notifications for one's own actions. Great job on getting it spot on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the information about disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' is not found in any of the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the ability to change this setting, aligning closely with the expected output. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section."
