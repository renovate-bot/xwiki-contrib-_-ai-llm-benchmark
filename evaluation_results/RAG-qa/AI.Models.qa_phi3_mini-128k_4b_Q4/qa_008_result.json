  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is highly relevant to the question about configuring attachment size limits, but it includes an unnecessary link to a general guide on XWiki basic concepts, which slightly detracts from its directness.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly specifies that the 'Maximum Upload Size' field default is set in bytes for XWiki versions before 10.9RC1, while the retrieval context only mentions a default of about 32 megabytes without linking it to any specific version.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides information about setting limits on the maximum size of an attachment and mentions the XWikiPreferences document, is ranked third. However, the first and second nodes discuss 'linking to external files and backlinks indexation' and 'the structure of XWiki pages and available actions', which are unrelated to configuring upload restrictions or size limits, and should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.82 because most of the expected output sentences align well with the nodes in the retrieval context, particularly regarding configuring mimetypes and setting maximum attachment size. However, the introductory sentence and specific configuration line are not directly supported by any node in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details like the 10MB limit and exact mimetype configuration steps found in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output mentions configuring attachment size to 10MB correctly but uses `xwiki.cfg` instead of `xwiki.properties` for mimetype configuration and omits the mimetype restriction step."
