  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.03 because the output contains numerous irrelevant statements that do not address the question about uploading specific file types with size restrictions. The statements cover unrelated topics such as AI, documentation, and guides, which significantly detracts from the relevancy of the response.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides 'detailed instructions on setting the maximum size of an attachment in XWikiPreferences', is ranked fifth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', the second node about 'ODT and PDF export features', and the third node listing 'various macros and features', should be ranked lower as they do not address configuring attachment types and size limits.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.70 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context provides detailed steps for configuring the maximum attachment size, aligning well with sentences related to this in the expected output, there is no mention of configuring allowed MIME types or editing the xwiki.properties file, which are key parts of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details on configuring xwiki.properties or setting size to 10 MB.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output is completely unrelated to the expected output, discussing topics such as Python scripts and AI models instead of configuring MIME types and attachment sizes."
