  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant and unclear statements that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context is ranked third. The first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and the settings for notifications', which is not relevant to enabling notifications or following pages/users. The second node is about 'overriding default notification templates and installation instructions', which is also not relevant. The relevant node, which mentions 'Follow a user' and 'Watched Entities', should be ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because while the retrieval context covers following pages, users, and viewing notifications, it lacks information about activating notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions following users and enabling notifications but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to true and specific steps for following pages or users."
