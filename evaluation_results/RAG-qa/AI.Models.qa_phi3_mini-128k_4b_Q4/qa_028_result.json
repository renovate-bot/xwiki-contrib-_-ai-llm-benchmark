  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the output partially addresses the question by providing relevant information about XWiki documentation, but it is not higher due to repeated irrelevant statements that do not directly address the specific requirement of restricting file uploads to images or PDFs of a certain size.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', which is unrelated to configuring file upload restrictions. The second node covers 'various applications and features of XWiki, such as tour guides and mail configuration', which do not relate to file upload settings. The third node is about 'PDF export customization using XSL and CSS', which is unrelated to setting file upload restrictions in XWiki. The fourth node discusses 'system filters, office document viewing, and other unrelated features', not about file upload restrictions. The fifth and sixth nodes contain 'references to various projects and images', which are not relevant to the topic of file upload restrictions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context lacks information on file upload restrictions, MIME type configuration, and attachment size settings.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to configuring MIME types or setting attachment size limits as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not align with the expected output. It incorrectly suggests using an extension for setting file size limits, which is not mentioned in the expected steps. It also does not specify modifying xwiki.properties for MIME types or setting the size in XWikiPreferences."
