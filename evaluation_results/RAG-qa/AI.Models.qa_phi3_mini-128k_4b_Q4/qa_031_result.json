  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the main content addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but the inclusion of multiple source links that do not directly contribute to the explanation reduces the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mixed with irrelevant ones. The first node discusses 'LDAP authentication settings in XWiki', which is unrelated to the input about token-based authentication, yet it is ranked higher than relevant nodes. Similarly, the third node talks about 'OpenID Connect scopes and response types', which are not directly related to JWT token-based authentication, but it is ranked above a relevant node. The relevant nodes that discuss 'Authorized Applications' and 'authentication using JWT tokens' are not consistently ranked higher than these irrelevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because several key aspects of the expected output, such as authenticating users with JWTs and configuring the token authenticator, are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context. However, details about generating a JWT token with specific claims and including it in the 'Authorization' header are not explicitly covered in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes details about configuring authorized applications and enabling the token authenticator, aligning with the expected answer. However, it lacks specific mention of required JWT claims and the use of the 'Authorization' header."
