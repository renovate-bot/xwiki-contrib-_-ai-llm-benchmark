  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because none of the statements in the actual output are relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens. The output contains numerous unrelated topics and lacks any direct answer to the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the second node which 'explains the configuration of authorized applications, which is relevant to using access tokens for authentication', and the fourth node which 'provides a description of the extension for authenticating users with JWT tokens, directly addressing the input question', are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node, discussing 'LDAP configuration and does not mention token-based authentication or JWT', and the third node, focusing on 'OpenID Connect scopes and response types, which is unrelated to the use of JWT tokens for authentication', should be ranked lower than these relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key aspects of the expected output, such as the use of JWT for authentication (sentence 1) and configuration details (sentences 2 and 5), are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, some specific instructions like generating a JWT token with required claims (sentence 3) and including it in the 'Authorization' header (sentence 4) are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms the use of JWT for authentication and mentions configuring authorized applications, but lacks details on token claims and specific configuration steps like setting the authclass property.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output is completely unrelated to the expected output, discussing unrelated topics like AI and Python, whereas the expected output focuses on token-based authentication for LLM Application."
