  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because none of the statements in the actual output address the issue of enabling notifications for one's own actions. All statements are irrelevant to the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'customization of page templates, internationalization, and other features unrelated to notification settings.' The second node is about 'administrating wiki features like users, groups, and rights, which is not relevant to notification settings for user activities.' The third node covers 'extensions like Office Importer, Font Awesome Icon Theme, and others, none of which relate to user notification settings.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any nodes in the retrieval context, as there is no information about notifications, triggering events, or advanced notification settings in the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user activity filters as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output contains irrelevant and unrelated information compared to the expected output, which is about notification settings. There is no alignment in terms of content or factual statements between the actual and expected outputs."
