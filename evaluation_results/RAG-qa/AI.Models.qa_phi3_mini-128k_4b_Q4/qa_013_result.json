    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the provided URLs and statements are entirely irrelevant and nonsensical in the context of enabling notifications for one's own activity.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'JWT token generation' and the second node is about 'database migration and invalid extensions', neither of which relate to notifications or user activity settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentences about notification settings and advanced filter options do not correspond to any information in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to notification settings or user activity filters as mentioned in the expected output."
