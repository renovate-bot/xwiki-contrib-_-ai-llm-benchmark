  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response effectively addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to the answer.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'model validation strategies in XWiki', the second node is about 'attachment validation and configuration in XWiki', and the third node provides 'details about the admin UI for model validation'. None of these are related to 'authenticating users with access tokens', leading to a low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context lacks any mention of key concepts such as 'Benutzer mit Zugriffstoken', 'LLM-Anwendung (BETA)-Erweiterung', 'JSON Web Tokens (JWT)', or the steps and limitations related to the 'Token-Authentifizierer'.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to token-based authentication, JWT, or the LLM-Anwendung (BETA)-Erweiterung mentioned in the expected output."
