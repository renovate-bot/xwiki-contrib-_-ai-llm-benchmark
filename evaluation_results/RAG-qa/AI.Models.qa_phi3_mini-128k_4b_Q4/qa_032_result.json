    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output contains irrelevant statements that do not address the input question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it may still contain some relevant information.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'group synchronization and customization for OpenID Connect,' which is not related to authenticating users with access tokens. Similarly, the second node is about 'protection levels for cookies and security strategies,' which does not pertain to the use of access tokens for user authentication.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication for the LLM application (BETA) extension or the specific steps and requirements for using JWT tokens."
