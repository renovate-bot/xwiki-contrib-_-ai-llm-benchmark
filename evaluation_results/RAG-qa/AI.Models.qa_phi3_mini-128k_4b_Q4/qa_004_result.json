  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the question about disabling notifications in XWiki. However, it is not lower because there might still be some relevant information present in the output.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses enabling and disabling the email feature and live email notifications grace time, but it does not address how to disable notifications for specific pages or user settings. Similarly, the second node talks about RSS feeds for notifications and the Notifications Macro but does not provide information on disabling notifications for specific pages or user settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions settings and filters but lacks details about automatic page watching and deleting filters."
