  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information on disabling notifications in XWiki. However, it includes a source link that doesn't directly address the question, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output incorrectly claims that 'New Page Alert' might be automatically enabled by default for all users, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that in XWiki 15.5+, by default, nothing is watched for new users.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked fifth, discusses the 'default auto-watched mode' and user settings for disabling notifications, which is pertinent to the input query. However, the first four nodes are irrelevant as they focus on notification RSS feeds, following users, filtering notifications, and email notifications, none of which address disabling notifications or modifying automatic page watching settings. This misalignment in ranking significantly lowers the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while nodes in the retrieval context support the expected output regarding default settings, user profile adjustments, and filter management (sentences 1, 3, and 4), there is no mention of notifications about changes on your work (sentence 2).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and user profile settings, but lacks details on automatic page watching, notification filters, and specific settings adjustments found in the expected output."
