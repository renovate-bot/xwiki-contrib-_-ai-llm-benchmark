  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.22 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the question about disabling notifications in XWiki, such as discussing unrelated topics like Python code snippets and SEO. However, the score is not zero, indicating there might be some relevant information present.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and the settings for notifications', but it does not mention disabling notifications or automatic page watching. The second node explains 'how to follow a user and default watch settings', but lacks information on disabling notifications or changing automatic page watching settings. Subsequent nodes similarly fail to address the user's query about disabling notifications or automatic page watching, focusing instead on unrelated aspects like 'filtering notifications', 'administrator level settings', and 'overriding default notification templates'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context supports the concept of automatic page watching and changing notification settings in the user profile (as seen in nodes 1 and 2 in the retrieval context), it lacks information about being notified of changes on your work and deleting existing notification filters, which are also part of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings but lacks details on automatic page watching for major modifications and deleting notification filters.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output contains irrelevant information and lacks key facts present in the expected output such as automatic page watching and notification settings."
