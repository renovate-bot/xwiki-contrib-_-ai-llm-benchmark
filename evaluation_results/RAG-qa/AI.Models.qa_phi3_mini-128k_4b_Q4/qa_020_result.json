  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response largely addresses the question about configuring team access in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant source links and mentions that do not directly contribute to solving the specific access configuration problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring team-specific access control in XWiki. The first node discusses XWiki's database support and programming features, which are not relevant. The second node is about the Notifications Application, unrelated to access control. The third node explains Nested Pages and subwikis, not addressing team-specific access rights. The fourth node mentions managing users and groups but lacks specific information on setting team access controls. The fifth node discusses group synchronization and customization, not directly related to the input question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.12 because only the concept of creating groups for each team (sentence 1) is supported by node 4 in the retrieval context. The rest of the expected output sentences, such as setting wiki-wide rights, space-level rights, and inheriting rights for child pages, are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about creating groups, setting rights, and inheriting rights, which are key steps in the expected output for access control in XWiki.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output suggests creating separate wikis for each team, contradicting expected output's use of groups within one wiki. It also lacks instructions for setting 'View' rights for XWikiAllGroup, which is vital in expected output to ensure visibility across teams."
