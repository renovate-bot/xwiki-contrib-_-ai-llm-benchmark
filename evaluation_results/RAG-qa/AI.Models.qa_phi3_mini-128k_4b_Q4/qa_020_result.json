  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.61 because the response partially addresses the question about configuring access and editing permissions in XWiki. However, it includes multiple irrelevant statements, such as links to unrelated sources and general advice on team communication, which do not directly help in solving the specific configuration issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses XWiki's database support and programming features, which are not relevant to configuring access controls for team areas. The second node describes the Notifications Application in XWiki, which does not relate to setting access permissions for team areas. The third node explains the concept of Nested Pages and subwikis in XWiki, which does not directly address configuring access controls for team areas. The fourth node provides information on managing users and groups, but it does not specifically address setting access permissions for team areas. The fifth node discusses group synchronization and customization in XWiki, which is not directly related to configuring access permissions for team areas.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only sentences 1 and 4 from the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specifically nodes 4 and 3 respectively. The rest of the sentences are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context, leading to a low score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about creating groups, setting wiki-wide or area-specific rights, or inheriting rights, which are all detailed in the expected output."
