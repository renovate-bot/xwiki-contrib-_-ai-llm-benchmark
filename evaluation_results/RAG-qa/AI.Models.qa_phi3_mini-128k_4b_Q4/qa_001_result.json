  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the response is highly relevant and effectively addresses the issue of the missing bell icon in XWiki. However, it includes source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'installation instructions and prerequisites for extensions', which does not relate to enabling notifications. The second node describes 'the functionality and appearance of the notifications menu', but lacks information on enabling notifications. The third node lists 'dependencies for the notifications extension', not addressing the issue of enabling notifications. Lastly, the fourth node talks about 'overriding notification templates', which is unrelated to the problem of enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any nodes in the retrieval context, as there is no mention of enabling notifications or the `xwiki.properties` file.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications or the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`, which are key elements in the expected output."
