  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because none of the statements in the actual output address the specific issue of the 'Bell' not being available in XWiki. Instead, the output contains unrelated information, such as source links, incomplete sentences, and topics unrelated to the XWiki 'Bell' issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'installation instructions and prerequisites' without addressing the 'Bell' icon issue. The second node describes the 'functionality and appearance of the notifications bell' but lacks information on resolving its absence. The third node lists 'dependencies' unrelated to the 'Bell' icon problem, and the fourth node focuses on 'customizing notification templates' without mentioning the 'Bell' icon issue.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because there is no information in the nodes in retrieval context about enabling notifications in the wiki or the specific setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`, which is the key information in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention 'notifications.enabled' or 'xwiki.properties', and provides irrelevant content unrelated to enabling notifications."
