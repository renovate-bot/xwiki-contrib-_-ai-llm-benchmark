    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes several irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about disabling notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'XWiki syntax and formatting,' which is unrelated to managing notifications. The second node describes 'an extension for user authentication using JSON Web Tokens,' which is not relevant to the question about disabling notifications. Additionally, the third node provides 'links and descriptions related to the LLM Application and its API,' which do not pertain to notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic tracking of pages or notification settings as mentioned in the expected output."
