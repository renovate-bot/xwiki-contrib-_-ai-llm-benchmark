  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because none of the statements in the output are relevant to the question about disabling notifications. Each statement addresses unrelated topics, such as URLs, Python scripts, and documentation, which do not provide the requested information.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The irrelevant node, ranked fourth, discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and the general settings menu', which does not directly address disabling automatic notifications or modifying auto-watch settings, unlike the first three nodes that focus on managing notifications and auto-watched pages.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because most sentences in the expected output can be linked to the 2nd node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'auto watched pages', 'notification preferences', and 'custom notification filters'. However, the specific mention of being notified of changes is not directly supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, matching the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit mention of being notified of changes on one's work and modifying notification settings in the user profile.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output contains unrelated information about Python and AI, while the expected output discusses notification settings and management in a user profile context."
