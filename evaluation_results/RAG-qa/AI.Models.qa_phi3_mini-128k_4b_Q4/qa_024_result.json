  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the question about disabling notifications, but it does contain some relevant information.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) discusses 'Auto Watch' and 'Default Watch Settings,' which are directly related to managing automatic notifications. However, irrelevant nodes ranked higher (ranks 1, 2, 4, and 5) discuss topics such as notification RSS feeds, notification preferences macros, and notification templates, which are not related to disabling notifications or modifying settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the retrieval context nodes support the first three sentences of the expected output, but there is no information about 'Filtres personnalis\u00e9s' in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions auto-watched pages and notification settings but lacks explicit details about modifying the 'Suivi automatique des pages' and deleting custom filters."
