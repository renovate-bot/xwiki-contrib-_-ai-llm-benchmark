  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the response is mostly relevant and addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using OpenID Connect. However, it includes source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question, which slightly lowers the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect provider endpoints', but does not mention 'customizing user profile fields or mapping them'. The second node talks about 'different authentication methods like Container Authentication and Active Directory', but does not cover 'customizing or mapping OpenID Connect user profile fields'. The third node provides 'links and descriptions related to OpenID Connect authentication', but lacks information on 'mapping user profile fields or using `oidc.user.mapping`'. The fourth node describes the 'OpenID Connect Authenticator extension and its compatibility', but does not address 'customization of user profile fields or mapping them'. The fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', which is unrelated to 'customization of user profile fields or the use of `oidc.user.mapping`'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the nodes in the retrieval context mention 'xwiki.properties' and restarting XWiki, they do not cover specific details about 'oidc.user.mapping', mapping examples, or replacing variables, which are crucial for the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties`, which is detailed in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output discusses configuring OpenID Connect but lacks specific details on mapping properties in `xwiki.properties` and restarting XWiki, which are critical in the expected output."
