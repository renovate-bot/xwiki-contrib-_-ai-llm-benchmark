  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant information included. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first three nodes provide detailed information on configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.mapping`, and `oidc.groups.separator`, which are crucial for setting up group synchronization. The irrelevant nodes, ranked fourth and fifth, focus on prerequisites, installation instructions, and general authentication management, which do not directly address the group synchronization setup process. Great job on achieving perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while specific configuration details like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, the general instructions for locating, editing, and saving the 'xwiki.properties' file are not directly found in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all key information from the expected output, including configuring 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' properties for group synchronization in the 'xwiki.properties' file.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes additional steps like enabling group synchronization, custom group synchronization, and troubleshooting that are not in the expected output. It lacks the specific details about configuring the separator and saving the file as in the expected output."
