    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements, including URLs to unrelated pages, incomplete and nonsensical sentences, and instructions that do not address the question about configuring team spaces in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access controls for teams. For example, the first node describes how user-created pages and spaces work in XWiki, but it does not provide any information on how to set access controls for teams. Similarly, the second node provides details on various macros and scripting languages supported by XWiki, which is not relevant to configuring access controls for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, defining rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages."
