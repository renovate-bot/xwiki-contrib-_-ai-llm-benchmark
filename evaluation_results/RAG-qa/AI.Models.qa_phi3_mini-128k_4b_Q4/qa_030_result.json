  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because none of the statements in the actual output are relevant to configuring team spaces in XWiki as per the input request. The output contains numerous unrelated and nonsensical statements that do not address the question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses a page in XWiki without mentioning access rights for teams, the second node talks about modifying resources using XML and HTTP methods, which is unrelated to team space permissions, and subsequent nodes continue to focus on unrelated topics such as editing comments, explaining spaces, actions after running a migrator, and configuration display options, none of which address configuring access rights for team spaces in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context, indicating a complete lack of relevant information.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about creating groups, setting rights at wiki and space levels, and inheriting rights for child pages, which are crucial elements in the expected output."
