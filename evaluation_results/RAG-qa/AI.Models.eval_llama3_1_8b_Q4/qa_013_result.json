  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.58 because while some relevant information may be present, the output contains multiple irrelevant URLs and statements that do not directly address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node discusses 'access decisions and authorization components', the second node is about 'configuring blocked attachment mimetypes', and the third node focuses on 'the checkAccess() method for access control and security measures'. These nodes are not related to notifications about one's own activity and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses AuthorizationSettler, attachment mimetypes, and access violations, which are irrelevant to the user's query about enabling notifications for their own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output is completely unrelated to the provided context and does not mention any of the key elements described, indicating a high level of hallucination."
