  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly states that adding the property `oidc.groups.mapping=MyXWikiGroup=my-oidc-group` will enable group synchronization, while the retrieval context specifies that group synchronization is enabled by adding the claim `xwiki_groups` to the property `oidc.userinfoclaims`.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first node is relevant, discussing the `oidc.groups.claim` property and providing an example of how to set it. The second node is irrelevant, focusing on domain-based instance authentication and session cookies, which should be ranked lower. The third node is relevant, covering default group synchronization and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property, thus it is correctly ranked.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because only a few sentences in the expected output are directly related to the nodes in the retrieval context, while many instructions and specific details are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the context discusses domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, which are irrelevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output aligns with the context regarding group synchronization but omits crucial details about domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration, which are significant parts of the context."
