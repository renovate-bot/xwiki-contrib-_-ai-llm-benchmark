  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer provides relevant information about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question, making the response less focused.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output incorrectly claims support for access tokens and processing them with Groovy code, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the first rank provides detailed information about JWT token generation, which is directly relevant to the input. The irrelevant nodes discussing blocked attachment mimetypes and custom authentication using Groovy script are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses attachment mimetype restrictions and custom authentication methods using Groovy scripts, which are irrelevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks critical details about JWT token requirements and blocked attachment mimetypes, which are necessary for complete alignment with the context. However, it correctly describes the configuration of custom authentication using a Groovy script, showing partial alignment."
