  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the output is mostly relevant, but the inclusion of a link to XWiki syntax documentation slightly detracts from its direct relevance to the issue with the notification bell.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first two nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, discussing 'changes in email notifications and user profile settings' and 'getting a notification RSS feed and the Notifications Macro' respectively, and should be ranked lower. The third node is relevant as it 'mentions that the extension status can be toggled by editing the configuration variable 'notifications.enabled' in xwiki.properties'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the issue of 'Die Glocke oben rechts ist nicht verf\u00fcgbar, auch nicht wenn die Erweiterung 'Alert Notification' installiert ist.'",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical details about changes, macros for settings, how to enable and disable the extension, how to get a notification RSS feed, the Notifications Macro, and the settings for notifications, leading to a complete misalignment with the expected context."
