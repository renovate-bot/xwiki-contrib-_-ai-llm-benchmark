  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes an irrelevant link to XWiki Syntax documentation, which does not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly suggests enabling 'Notifications Application' or 'Custom Notifications Filters Preferences', while the retrieval context indicates that 'Notifications Filters Preferences' is deprecated in favor of 'Custom Notifications Filters Preferences' or 'System Notifications Filters Preferences'.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses notification macros and preferences but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. The second node describes different ways to receive notifications but lacks information on enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node explains configuring email notifications but does not cover enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions and includes irrelevant details about general notification preferences.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output misses several key details that are present in the context, such as displaying notifications about events that happened on the wiki, different ways to be notified in XWiki, and selecting types of notifications to receive by email and setting the interval between emails."
