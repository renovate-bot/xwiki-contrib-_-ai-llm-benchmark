  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and provides detailed information on setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes a link about scalability and performance, which is not directly related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context are not relevant to the input. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, including installation instructions, dependencies, and configuration guides for specific systems, but does not address the specific steps required to set up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The second node discusses authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration, which is not relevant to the process of setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The third node provides information about XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities, which are unrelated to the specific steps required for configuring group synchronization with an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific process of setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, focusing instead on unrelated topics such as general OpenID Connect integration, domain-based authentication, and XWiki's scalability.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating no hallucination."
