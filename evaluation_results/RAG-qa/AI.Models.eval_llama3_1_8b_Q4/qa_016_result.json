  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant to the question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. However, it includes an irrelevant link to the scalability and performance features of XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration,' which does not relate to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider. The second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication, dependencies, and configuration guides,' but does not address mapping additional user profile fields. The third node talks about 'XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities,' which are unrelated to the customization of user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to customize user profile fields or map additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with any of the provided contexts, discussing unrelated topics such as user profile fields and their customization instead of the relevant technical details."
