  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer provides useful resources, but the URLs do not directly address the specific configuration steps needed in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.64 because the actual output repeatedly mentions configuring and managing 'spaces', but the retrieval context clearly states that the notion of space has been removed from the XWiki UI.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses where the configuration should be displayed in XWiki, but does not provide information on setting access rights for teams. The second node explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki, but does not address access control or permissions for teams. The third node talks about XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities, which are not relevant to configuring team-specific access rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to configure team-specific permissions in XWiki, focusing instead on unrelated features like multi-tenancy and clustering.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output aligns with some parts of the context but fails to include several important details such as all possible values for 'scope', the detailed usage of 'linkPrefix', the concept of spaces and sub-pages, and XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities. There are no direct contradictions, but the omissions lead to a high hallucination score."
