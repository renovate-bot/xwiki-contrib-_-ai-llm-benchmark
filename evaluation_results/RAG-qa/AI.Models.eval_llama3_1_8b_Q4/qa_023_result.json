  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer addresses the main question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but includes URLs that are not directly relevant to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses notification preferences macros, the second node covers email notification settings, and the third node explains filtering notifications, none of which address the issue of enabling notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, aligning perfectly with the concepts and terms mentioned.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not provide information on how to activate notifications for one's own actions, focusing instead on other notification preferences and technical details.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because while the actual output generally aligns with the context by discussing email notifications, it lacks specific details mentioned in the context, such as specific macros and filtering modes, leading to partial alignment and some degree of hallucination."
