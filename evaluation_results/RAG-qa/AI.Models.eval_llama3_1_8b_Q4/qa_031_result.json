  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because while the response addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not directly pertain to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly states that protection must be set to either encryption or all for the 'remember me' cookie functionality, while the retrieval context allows for 'all', 'validation', 'encryption', or 'none'.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes, ensuring precise and accurate retrieval.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key points from the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, such as token-based authentication, JWT claims, and enabling the token authenticator, some details like configuring authorized applications and limitations of the authenticator are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context focuses on document management and cookie protection in a wiki system, which does not address the question about user authentication with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output fails to mention key details related to the contexts, such as operations on documents and 'remember me' cookie functionality, which indicates a significant level of hallucination."
