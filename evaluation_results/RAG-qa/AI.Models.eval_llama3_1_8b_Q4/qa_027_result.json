  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the process of configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes an irrelevant URL about scalability and performance, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output mentions specific properties (`oidc.group.synchronization=true` and `oidc.group.mapping=your-group-mapping`) for configuring group synchronization that are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first node discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering, which are not relevant to configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The second node focuses on authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration, which does not address the process of configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The third node mentions the OpenID Connect Authenticator and provides links to configuration guides, which are relevant to setting up synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering, domain-based authentication, and general OpenID Connect setup, none of which address the specific process of synchronizing groups with an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output omits several key details mentioned in the context, including XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering features, domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, and prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, and configuration guides for OpenID Connect."
