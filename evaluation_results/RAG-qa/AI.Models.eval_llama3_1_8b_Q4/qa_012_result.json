  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the provided URLs are irrelevant to the input about not receiving notifications, but the rest of the response is somewhat related to the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'blocked attachment mimetypes and their configuration,' the second node describes 'various programming and permission rights in the wiki,' and the third node outlines 'different user rights such as comment, edit, delete, and administration rights.' None of these are related to notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, programming rights, and permissions, which are irrelevant to the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks significant details on configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, administration UI, and various rights (programming, register, create wikis, script, comment, edit, delete, and administration), leading to a high degree of factual omission."
