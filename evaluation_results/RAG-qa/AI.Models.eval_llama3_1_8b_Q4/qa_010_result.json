  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and provides a clear explanation on configuring permissions in XWiki. However, it includes URLs to documentation pages about Nested Pages Migration and Exports, which are not directly relevant to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the concept of 'space' is used to organize pages and content in XWiki, while the retrieval context states that the notion of space has been removed from the UI.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring team-specific access control in XWiki. The first node discusses creating spaces and sub-pages, the second node is about migration plans, and the third node covers XAR export and import functionalities.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provided does not address configuring permissions for team spaces in XWiki, focusing instead on unrelated aspects like space creation, migration plans, and XAR export functionality.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information mentioned in the context, such as the creation of spaces or WebHome pages, executing a plan or migration process, and XAR export for importing/exporting pages in XWiki."
