  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the answer partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes irrelevant details such as a link about generating Ed25519 keys with OpenSSL and an invitation for further questions, which do not directly address the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the first node, which discusses form utilization on XWiki.org and does not provide any information about authenticating users with access tokens, is ranked higher than the second node, which describes the requirements for generating a JWT token, including the necessary claims and the use of the 'Authorization' header, directly relevant to authenticating users with access tokens. Additionally, the third node, which discusses various features and extensions available on XWiki but does not provide any information about authenticating users with access tokens, is also ranked higher than it should be.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output can be directly attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, demonstrating a perfect match.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses forms and references on XWiki.org, which is unrelated to the topic of authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output fails to mention several key components described in the context, such as the Reference Form, Questionnaire Form, Menu application, Notifications, and Invitation. Instead, it focuses on the LLM Application Authenticator and JWT tokens, which leads to a significant misalignment with the provided context."
