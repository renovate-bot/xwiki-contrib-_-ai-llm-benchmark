  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the input perfectly. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.54 because the actual output incorrectly mentions the need to install the Attachment Validation Application extension, a specific 'Attachments Restriction' option in the Administration UI, adding new lines with specific settings in the 'Attachment Types' section, and incorrectly states the maximum attachment size as 10MB instead of 100GB. Additionally, it incorrectly specifies that only images and PDF files of a maximum of 10MB will be allowed as attachments.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node, which is ranked highest, is irrelevant as it describes how to add attachments using the top level menu, attachment tab, and WYSIWYG editor, but does not address configuring allowed mimetypes or setting maximum attachment size. The second and third nodes are relevant as they mention configuring blocked attachment mimetypes and setting the maximum size of an attachment, respectively.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.54 because while the retrieval context (node 3) provides detailed steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (Step 2 in the expected output), it lacks information on configuring allowed mimetypes (Step 1 in the expected output).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context provides detailed instructions on adding attachments and blocking certain mimetypes but does not address file size restrictions or how to ensure only images or PDFs of a maximum 10MB can be uploaded.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output omits several key details mentioned in the factual alignments, such as methods of adding attachments, configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, and various methods of uploading attachments. These omissions indicate a high degree of hallucination."
