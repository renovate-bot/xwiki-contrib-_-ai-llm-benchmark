  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.71 because the actual output incorrectly suggests that setting the session cookie on a top-level domain will work for XWiki instances with very different domains, and it also incorrectly states that OpenID Connect can be disabled using the xwiki.cfg file instead of the xwiki.properties file.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'domain-based instance configuration and session cookies', the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator', and the third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension'. None of these contexts address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts on first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based instance configuration, session cookies, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to automatically activate user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output aligns with the context regarding the configuration of the session cookie and the xwiki.cfg file but fails to mention prerequisites, installation instructions, or specific dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator, which are expected based on the context."
