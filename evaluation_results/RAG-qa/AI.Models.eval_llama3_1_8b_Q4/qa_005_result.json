  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but the statement 'You don't need to make any specific adjustments for this functionality.' is incorrect as the user is facing issues and needs guidance on specific adjustments.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', which is not related to enabling user accounts on first login using OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator' but does not address the specific configuration needed. The third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', which is also not relevant to the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because only the mention of the 'xwiki.properties' file and configuring properties related to OpenID Connect (sentence 1) could be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, while the rest of the instructions and details were not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key details provided in the context, such as the need to update the configuration of the session cookie, specific links and details about prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, and configuration guides, as well as the automatic synchronization feature and specific dependencies required for the OIDC authenticator extension."
