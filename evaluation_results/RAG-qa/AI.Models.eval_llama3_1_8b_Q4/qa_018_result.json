  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the main question effectively, but the inclusion of a URL that does not directly address the specific requirement slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'HTTP methods and media types for retrieving page history and children,' the second node provides 'information on creating or updating page translations,' and the third node discusses 'creating a new wiki and retrieving lists of spaces.' None of these contexts relate to configuring MIME types or attachment size limits.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention any of the steps or configurations related to uploading images or PDF files, setting MIME type restrictions, or configuring maximum attachment sizes as described in the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides information about HTTP endpoints and methods, which is unrelated to the input question about file upload restrictions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks essential details about the HTTP methods, media types, descriptions, and status codes for the endpoints, which are crucial for alignment with the context."
