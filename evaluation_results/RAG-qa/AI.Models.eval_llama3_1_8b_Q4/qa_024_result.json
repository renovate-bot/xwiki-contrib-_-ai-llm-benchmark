  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.70 because the answer provides some relevant information on how to disable notifications, but includes irrelevant statements such as URLs and a concluding remark that do not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly claims that there is a list of types of notifications enabled by default, while the retrieval context specifies that notifications are only sent by default when users are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes about email notifications and RSS feeds are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while the retrieval context nodes align well with the expected output regarding auto watched pages and notification preferences (nodes 1 and 3), it lacks information about being notified of changes on your work.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context focuses on configuring email notifications and user preferences, which does not directly address the user's question on how to disable unwanted notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the factual alignments, such as displaying notifications, user preferences, email notification settings, RSS feeds, and the Notifications Macro. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
