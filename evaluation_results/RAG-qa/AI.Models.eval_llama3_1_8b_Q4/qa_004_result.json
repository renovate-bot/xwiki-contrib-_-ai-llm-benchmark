  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes a link to XWiki syntax documentation, which is not directly related to disabling notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes in the retrieval context are relevant to managing notifications and automatic notifications respectively, and are ranked higher. However, the second node, which lists various notification preferences macros without specific information on disabling automatic notifications, is less relevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only the first two sentences of the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, while the last two sentences have no corresponding information in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is highly relevant and there are no reasons for irrelevancy. Great job!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output aligns with the context in explaining how to manage custom notification filters and the impact of using the watch button on existing filters, but it fails to mention the specific macros related to notifications preferences, which is a key detail in the context."
