  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information on configuring file upload restrictions. However, it includes links to Access Rights and Authentication documentation, which are not directly related to the question about file upload restrictions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring file upload restrictions. For example, the first node discusses 'programming rights and permissions within the XWiki environment,' which is not relevant. Similarly, the second node talks about 'cookie protection levels and IP address usage for encryption,' and the third node lists 'dependencies for an XWiki extension,' both of which are also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses permissions, security configurations, and dependencies, none of which address the specific question about restricting file types and sizes for uploads.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several specific details mentioned in the context, such as programming rights, register rights, create wikis rights, script rights, protection levels, IP address usage, authentication strategies, and dependencies for the extension 'org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-attachment-validation-ui 16.3.1'."
