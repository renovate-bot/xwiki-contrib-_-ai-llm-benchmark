  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements, such as URLs and explanations about unrelated documentation, which do not directly address how to deny script rights to a space administrator. However, it does contain some relevant information, hence it is not scored lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node explaining that 'the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page' is ranked third, while the first and second nodes, discussing the AuthorizationSettler process and custom rights registration, are not directly related to denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses the AuthorizationSettler and its configuration, but it does not address how to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output completely lacks the necessary information about the AuthorizationSettler, its configuration, Right definitions, the process of registering/unregistering custom rights, associated exceptions, and details about various rights (comment, edit, delete) as mentioned in the context."
