  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the provided URLs are not directly relevant to the issue with the notification bell, even though the rest of the response is mostly accurate and helpful.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'various features and extensions available in XWiki' but does not address the notification bell issue. The second node lists 'different notification preferences and macros' without providing relevant information on enabling notifications. The third node explains 'how to follow a user and the default watch settings' but does not address the specific problem of the notification bell not being available.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially supports the expected output. The first sentence is supported by nodes in the retrieval context, but the second sentence is not mentioned in any of the nodes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context includes irrelevant parts such as 'Menu application' and 'Display notifications about events happening in the wiki.' which do not address the issue of the bell icon not being available even when the 'Notification d'alerte' extension is installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key details described in the context, such as the Menu application, the Invitation application, various notification preferences and filters, and specific details about notifications."
