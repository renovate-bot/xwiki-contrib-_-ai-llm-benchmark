    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.59 because the first node discusses enabling and disabling the notification module at the server level, which is not directly related to user-specific notification settings, and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the fourth node discusses clearing notifications and grouping similar notifications, which is not directly related to changing notification settings or disabling notifications, and should also be ranked lower. However, the second, third, and fifth nodes are correctly identified as relevant, discussing the notifications menu, settings, and managing automatic page watching and custom filters.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context (node 5) supports the idea of notifications for pages users created or updated (related to sentence 1 of the expected output), it does not provide information on changing the setting for 'Automatic page watching' or deleting existing notification filters (related to sentences 3 and 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions settings and filters but lacks details on automatic page watching and major modifications."
