  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because the output partially addresses the question about disabling notifications in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant details about types of notifications without directly explaining how to disable them.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and enabling/disabling notification types,' which doesn't address disabling automatic notifications. The second node talks about 'following a user and default watch settings,' but lacks information on disabling notifications. The third node covers 'filtering notifications,' without mentioning how to disable automatic notifications. The fourth node is about 'enabling/disabling email notifications,' not related to the input query. The fifth node discusses 'administrative settings for notifications,' but doesn't help users disable automatic notifications. Lastly, the sixth node is about 'overriding default notification templates,' which is not relevant to the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while nodes in the retrieval context support the idea of automatic page watching and notification settings (sentence 1 and 3), they do not mention being notified about changes on your work (sentence 2).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and user profile settings but lacks specific details about automatic page watching and deleting notification filters."
