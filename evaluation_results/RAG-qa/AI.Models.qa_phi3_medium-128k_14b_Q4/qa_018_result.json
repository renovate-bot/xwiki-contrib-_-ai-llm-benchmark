  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the response mostly addresses the question about configuring upload restrictions for images and PDFs, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly relate to the topic, slightly lowering the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first three nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, discussing topics like 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', 'ODT export and PDF export features', and 'features and macros available in XWiki', which do not relate to configuring attachment upload restrictions. These should be ranked lower than the fourth and fifth nodes, which are directly relevant as they include links to 'Size Limit' and 'Mimetype Restriction' and provide steps on setting the maximum size of an attachment.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.56 because while the retrieval context's 5th node supports the steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (related to sentences in 'Schritt 2'), it lacks information on configuring MIME types and restricting uploads to images and PDFs (related to sentences in 'Schritt 1').",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details on setting MIME types in xwiki.properties and the exact steps for setting the size to 10 MB."
