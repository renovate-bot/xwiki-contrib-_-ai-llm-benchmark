  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.07 because the output contains numerous irrelevant statements related to XWiki and MediaWiki configurations, which do not directly address the input question about setting upload limits on a different wiki platform. The presence of these unrelated details significantly lowers the relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which 'explains how to set the maximum size of an attachment in XWikiPreferences', is ranked third. However, it should be ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node 'discusses linking to external files and images, backlinks indexation, and upload summaries', which is not related to configuring allowed mimetypes or setting maximum attachment sizes. Similarly, the second node 'provides information about XWiki's structure and page features', which does not relate to configuring attachment upload settings or size limits.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the steps related to configuring the maximum attachment size (Steps 2.1 to 2.5), there is no information in the retrieval context about configuring allowed mimetypes or editing the xwiki.properties file as described in Step 1 of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific instructions for 10MB limit and allowed mimetypes configuration."
