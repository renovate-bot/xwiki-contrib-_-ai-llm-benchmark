  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant to the question about limiting attachment types and sizes, but it includes a general link to XWiki basic concepts, which is not directly relevant to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides information about setting the maximum size of an attachment and mentions configuration steps in XWikiPreferences, is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing linking to external files and image display, and the second node explaining the structure of XWiki pages, are ranked higher than the relevant node. This misordering affects the score, as the relevant information is not prioritized.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.73 because while many steps in the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as node 3 supporting the configuration steps for maximum attachment size, some introductory and specific configuration details are missing from the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details on configuring 'xwiki.properties' and setting size to 10MB.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output correctly explains setting the maximum attachment size and mentions mime type configuration, but incorrectly suggests using `attachment.download.forceDownload` for mime-types instead of `attachment.upload.allowList` in `xwiki.properties`."
