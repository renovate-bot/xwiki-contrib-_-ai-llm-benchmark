  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer provides relevant information about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider, but it includes several URLs that are not directly related to the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator, its developer, and installation details, but does not mention customizing user profile fields or mapping additional fields. Similarly, the second node discusses various authentication methods for the XWiki RESTful API, including OIDC, but does not provide information on customizing or mapping user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about customizing user profile fields or mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file."
