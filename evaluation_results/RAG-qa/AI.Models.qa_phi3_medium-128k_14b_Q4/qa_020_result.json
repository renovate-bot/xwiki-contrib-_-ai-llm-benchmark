  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because the response partially addresses the question about configuring team access in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the task, which lowers the relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access control for teams in XWiki. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database support and programming features', which are unrelated to the input query. The second node focuses on 'notifications and the XWiki Development Team', which does not pertain to the task at hand. The third node covers 'using nested pages and subwikis', failing to address the specific need for configuring access rights for teams. The fourth node mentions 'managing users and groups' but lacks specific information on team access configuration. Lastly, the fifth node discusses 'group synchronization and customization', which is not directly related to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the expected output sentences can be linked to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete lack of relevant information.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to setting access controls, creating groups, or managing rights in XWiki as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output suggests creating separate (Sub)-Wikis instead of groups, and using ACLs and 'IstAdmin' group, which deviates significantly from the expected output's steps like setting wiki-wide and area-level rights. Concepts like 'Sider' and 'Category' do not align with the expected approach. Key discrepancies in approach and terminology exist."
