  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because the output contains multiple irrelevant source links and a misleading claim about access control in XWiki, which detracts from fully addressing the input question. However, it still provides some relevant information about configuring access in XWiki, which is why it is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database efficiency and programming features', which do not pertain to configuring access controls for team areas. The second node is about 'notifications and application details', unrelated to access permissions. The third node explains 'nested pages and subwikis', not directly related to team-specific access rights. The fourth node provides information on 'managing users and groups' but does not specifically address setting access rights for team areas. Lastly, the fifth node is about 'group synchronization and customization', which does not directly relate to configuring access rights for team areas in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.12 because only one supportive reason was identified, linking sentence 1 to node 4 in the retrieval context, while the rest of the expected output lacks corresponding nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about access control steps or rights management mentioned in the expected output."
