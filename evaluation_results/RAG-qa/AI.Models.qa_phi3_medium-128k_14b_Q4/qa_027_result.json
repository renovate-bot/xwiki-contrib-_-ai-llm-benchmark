  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Everything aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked third, mentions 'group synchronization and the use of the `oidc.groups.mapping` property', which is directly related to the input query about configuring group synchronization. However, irrelevant nodes ranked first, second, fourth, and fifth discuss 'authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints', 'container authentication and other methods', 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication', and 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', none of which address group synchronization, causing the score to be lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.44 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context provides relevant information on configuring group synchronization and properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', it lacks specific details such as locating and saving the 'xwiki.properties' file and replacing placeholder values with actual ones, which are present in sentences 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks details on configuring oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator as outlined in the expected output."
