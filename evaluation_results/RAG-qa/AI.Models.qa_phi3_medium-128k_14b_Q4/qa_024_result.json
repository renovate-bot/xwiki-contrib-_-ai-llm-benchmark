  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.58 because the actual output contains several irrelevant statements, such as source links and image links, which do not address the question about disabling notifications. However, the score is not lower because there may still be some relevant information present that partially addresses the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly suggests that 'Create global notification filters' is used to manage global notifications, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that it is only for creating global notification filters, not managing them.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The irrelevant node, ranked fourth, is about 'getting a notification RSS feed' and does not relate to 'modifying notification settings or automatic page watching', which is less relevant compared to the first three nodes that directly address 'auto-watched mode', 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', and 'Auto Watch' settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers aspects like auto-watched pages and custom filters, aligning with the expected answer about automatic page tracking and filter management. However, it lacks explicit mention of modifying 'Suivi automatique des pages' in user profile settings.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks specific mention of 'following pages with significant changes' and 'deleting existing notification filters', which are key facts in the expected output. It introduces different instructions on managing notifications not present in the expected output."
