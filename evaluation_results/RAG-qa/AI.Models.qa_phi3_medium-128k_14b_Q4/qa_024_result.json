  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the question about disabling notifications on Facebook, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not pertain to the topic, slightly reducing its relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The first three nodes are relevant as they discuss 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode', 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', and 'Auto Watch', which are directly related to disabling automatic notifications. The irrelevant node, ranked fourth, discusses 'Get a notification RSS feed' and 'Notifications Macro', which are not related to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, aligning with the expected answer's details on automatic page following and filter management. However, it lacks explicit mention of modifying these settings in the user's notification profile."
