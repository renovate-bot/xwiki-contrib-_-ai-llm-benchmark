    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens. For example, the first node discusses 'group synchronization and customization for OpenID Connect,' and the second node is about 'protection levels for cookies and security strategies,' neither of which are related to the input question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication for LLM applications, JWT tokens, or the specific configuration steps mentioned in the expected output."
