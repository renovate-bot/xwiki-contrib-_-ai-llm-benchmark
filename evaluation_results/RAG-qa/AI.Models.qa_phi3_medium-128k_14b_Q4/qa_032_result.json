  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly answer the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the Model-Validation-UI extension is used for setting up access tokens and configuring authentication scenarios, which are not mentioned in the retrieval context. Additionally, it describes steps involving the Name Strategy Scheduler and Model-Validation API for access tokens, which are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'model validation strategies in XWiki', which is unrelated to 'user authentication with access tokens'. The second node is about 'attachment validation and configuration in XWiki', not 'authentication using access tokens'. The third node provides information on 'the admin UI for model validation', which does not pertain to 'authenticating users with access tokens'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context lacks any mention of relevant concepts such as 'Benutzer mit Zugriffstoken', 'LLM-Anwendung (BETA)-Erweiterung', 'JWT', or related authentication processes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to token-based authentication or JWT as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output discusses authentication with access tokens but does not match the expected JWT-based token authentication method. Key steps like configuring `xwiki.authentication.authclass` and using JWT with specific claims are missing. Instead, it mentions Model-Validation-UI, which is not part of the expected output."
