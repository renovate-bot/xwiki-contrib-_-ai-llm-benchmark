  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes a source link that is not directly relevant, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'model validation strategies in XWiki', the second node talks about 'attachment validation and configuration', and the third node provides details on 'the admin UI for model validation'. None of these are related to 'authenticating users with access tokens', which is why the score is not higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context does not cover topics like 'Benutzer mit Zugriffstoken', 'Token-basierten Authentifizierung', 'externen Anwendungen', 'JSON Web Tokens (JWT)', or any other related concepts.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to token-based authentication, JWT, or the LLM-Anwendung (BETA)-Erweiterung mentioned in the expected output."
