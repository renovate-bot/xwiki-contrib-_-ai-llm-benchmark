  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is completely relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The first three nodes provide crucial information about `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping`, which are essential for configuring group synchronization, while the fourth and fifth nodes only offer general OpenID Connect information and authentication management, which are not directly related to the group synchronization process.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.55 because while nodes in retrieval context provide specific examples and details for configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, they lack coverage of introductory and generic instructional content present in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers configuring 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', matching the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit instructions on saving the file and restarting XWiki."
