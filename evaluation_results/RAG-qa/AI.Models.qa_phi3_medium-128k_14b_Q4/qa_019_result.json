  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the answer contains several URLs that are irrelevant to the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator. However, the answer still provides some relevant information, which is why it is not scored lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node contains only links to images and references, which are not relevant to the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator. The second node discusses authentication using Firefox and LDAP, which is also not related to the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the sentence in the expected output does not match any part of the provided retrieval context, which discusses image links, LDAP configuration, and form utilization, none of which relate to XWiki rights.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about admin rights or their implications in XWiki, which is the core of the expected answer."
