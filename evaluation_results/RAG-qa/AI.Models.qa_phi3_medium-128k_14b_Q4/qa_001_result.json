  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the response is mostly relevant and helpful, addressing the issue of the missing bell icon in XWiki. However, it includes repeated source links that do not directly address the specific problem, which prevents the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context is relevant, mentioning the 'Alert menu' and the bell icon, which directly relates to the user's issue. However, the first node discusses 'installation instructions and prerequisites for extensions', which is not directly related to the problem, leading to a lower score. Additionally, the third node, which 'lists dependencies for the notifications extension', and the fourth node, which 'talks about overriding notification templates', are also irrelevant to the issue of enabling notifications or fixing the bell icon, and should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`, which is the core information in the expected answer."
