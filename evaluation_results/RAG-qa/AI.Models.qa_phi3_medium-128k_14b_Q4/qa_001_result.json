  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the response largely addresses the issue of the bell icon not being available in XWiki, but includes irrelevant source links and a statement about offline extension installation, which do not directly help resolve the specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output implies that installing extensions offline might be possible through complex manual methods, whereas the retrieval context clearly states that offline installation is not supported.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'installation instructions and prerequisites', the second node describes 'notification features and appearance', the third node lists 'dependencies', and the fourth node talks about 'customizing notification templates'. None of these address the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki, which is the focus of the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not provide any information related to enabling notifications in the wiki or the `xwiki.properties` file, which are crucial for the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file, which is the core instruction in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides various troubleshooting steps but lacks specific instructions on enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties`, as outlined in the expected output."
