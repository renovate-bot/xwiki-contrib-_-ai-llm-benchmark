  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) that mentions the 'notifications.enabled' setting in 'xwiki.properties' is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and the settings for notifications, and the second node talks about overriding default notification templates and installation instructions, both of which are not relevant to enabling notifications in the 'xwiki.properties' file.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context explicitly mentions enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`, which matches the expected output."
