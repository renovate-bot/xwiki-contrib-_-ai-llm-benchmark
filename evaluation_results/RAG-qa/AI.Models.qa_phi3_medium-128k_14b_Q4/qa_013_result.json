    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer largely addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'customization of page templates and internationalization', which is unrelated to notification settings. The second node describes 'an application for administrating wiki features', which does not pertain to user notification settings. The third node includes information about 'various extensions like Office Importer and Syntax Highlighting', none of which relate to enabling notifications for one's own activity. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than any relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user activity filters mentioned in the expected output."
