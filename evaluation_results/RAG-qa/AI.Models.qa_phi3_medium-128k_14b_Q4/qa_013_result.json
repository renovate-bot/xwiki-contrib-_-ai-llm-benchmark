  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.58 because the provided URLs do not address the specific question about enabling notifications for one's own activity, making the response partially irrelevant.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'token generation and JWT claims', which is unrelated to notifications for user activity. The second node discusses 'database migration and invalid extensions', which is not relevant to activating notifications for user actions. The third node lists 'various XWiki extensions and their functionalities', which does not relate to enabling notifications for a user's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about notifications, user activity, filter options, or notification settings in user profiles.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user activity filters as mentioned in the expected output."
