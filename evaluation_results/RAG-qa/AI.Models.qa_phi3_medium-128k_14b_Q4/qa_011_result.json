    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses notification RSS feed and settings but does not address the notification bell issue. The second node talks about overriding notification templates and installation instructions without mentioning enabling notifications. The third node lists various notification features and settings but lacks information on enabling notifications. The fourth node covers customization options without addressing enabling notifications. The fifth node describes the 'Clear All' link and notification display without providing information on enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`, nor does it provide information about setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`."
