    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node is relevant as it 'explains how to follow a user and receive notifications about their activities,' which directly addresses the issue. However, the second node, which 'discusses filters for notifications,' and the third node, which is about 'getting an RSS feed for notifications,' are not directly relevant and should be ranked lower. Additionally, the fifth node, which discusses the 'What's New' application, is also not directly relevant to the problem of not receiving notifications and should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because half of the expected output sentences are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as the details on the 'alert' menu (node 4) and user following (node 1). However, key instructions like enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and subscribing to pages or users are not found in the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions following users and watching pages, but lacks details on enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and using the alert menu."
