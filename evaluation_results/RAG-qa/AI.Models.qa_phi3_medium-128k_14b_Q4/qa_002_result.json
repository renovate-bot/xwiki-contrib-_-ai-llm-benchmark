  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the response largely addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.43 because the actual output contains several contradictions: it incorrectly claims that nothing is watched by default, whereas earlier versions of XWiki had users watching the whole wiki by default; it states that no notifications are received until manual actions are taken, contrary to the fact that application types are enabled by default in later versions; it suggests automatic enabling of application types upon certain actions, which is not supported by the context; and it misrepresents the purpose of the 'network' tab in user profiles.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, explaining how to follow a user to receive notifications, and is ranked appropriately. However, the second and third nodes, which discuss filters, settings, and RSS feeds without addressing enabling notifications or subscribing to specific content, are ranked higher than the fourth node, which is relevant as it outlines ways to receive notifications through the Notifications Application. The fifth node, discussing the 'What's New' application, is also irrelevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context supports details about enabling notifications through the 'alert' menu, following users, and checking the 'network' tab (as mentioned in sentences 4, 5, and 6 of the expected output), it lacks information on enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` and subscribing to pages or users (sentences 1, 2, and 3).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes details on following users and notification settings, but lacks explicit mention of enabling notifications via 'xwiki.properties' and watching pages or wikis.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output omits enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and subscribing to pages or users. It mentions watching users and application types but lacks details on enabling notifications through the alert menu. Some filtering options are covered, but the focus is not aligned with the expected output instructions."
