    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', which does not relate to activating user accounts on first login with OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and its installation', lacking the specific configuration details needed. The third node talks about 'OpenID Connect authenticator and its compatibility' without addressing user account activation. Lastly, the fourth node lists 'various OpenID Connect endpoints and properties' but fails to mention the specific property `oidc.enableUser` or any instructions for automatic activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context (specifically node 4) supports the instructions about adjusting the 'xwiki.properties' file and setting the 'oidc.enableUser' property, it lacks explicit details on saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, and ensuring automatic activation of new user accounts upon first login via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the property 'oidc.enableUser' or the steps to update 'xwiki.properties' for automatic user account activation."
