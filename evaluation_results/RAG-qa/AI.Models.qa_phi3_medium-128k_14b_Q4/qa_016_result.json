  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because several irrelevant statements related to 'java', '<OAuthProvider>', and other unrelated tags were included, which do not address the customization of user profile fields in XWiki from an OpenID Connect provider. However, the score is not lower because there is some relevant information that partially addresses the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node (rank 5) mentions the configuration files, including `xwiki.properties`, which is pertinent to mapping user profile fields. However, irrelevant nodes (ranks 1 to 4) are ranked higher and discuss topics such as prerequisites, general functionality, container authentication, and various endpoints, which do not address the customization of user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the information provided in the 2nd node in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuration files and xwiki.properties but lacks specific details on customizing user profile fields and the oidc.user.mapping property."
