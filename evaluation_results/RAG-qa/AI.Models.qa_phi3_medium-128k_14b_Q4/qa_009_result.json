  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the response largely addresses the question of denying script rights to a space administrator, but it includes repeated irrelevant source links that do not directly address the question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'programming rights and script execution' but does not address denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node lists 'various rights and their properties' but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator. The third node explains 'the script right and its default settings' but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator. The fourth node provides 'technical details about checking access rights' but does not address the specific issue of denying script rights to a space administrator. The fifth node discusses 'rights conversion and exclusion of pages and spaces,' which is unrelated to denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, matching the expected output."
