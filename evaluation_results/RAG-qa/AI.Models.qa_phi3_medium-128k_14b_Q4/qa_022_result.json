  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response partially addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant statements such as source links, syntax documentation, and image links that do not directly help solve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that notifications might be disabled for all users by default, whereas the retrieval context states that administrators have the ability to enable notifications for all users by default.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'Enable and disable the extension', and the second node covers 'Follow a user', both directly related to the input about enabling notifications. The irrelevant nodes, such as the third node about 'getting a notification RSS feed and settings' and the fourth node listing 'various notification preferences macros', are correctly ranked lower as they do not directly address the input needs.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some general concepts like enabling notifications and following users or pages (related to nodes in retrieval context) are supported, specific details such as setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties', clicking the 'alert' menu, and viewing followed users in the 'network' tab are not found in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to true, following pages, and using the alert menu.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output addresses notifications but lacks the specific steps in the expected output, such as setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties` and using the 'alerte' menu. It also introduces new elements like RSS feeds and macros not mentioned in the expected output."
