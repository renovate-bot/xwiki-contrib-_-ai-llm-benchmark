  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the output includes a URL that does not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and the settings for notifications,' which is not about enabling notifications or following pages/users. Similarly, the second node is about 'overriding default notification templates and installation instructions,' which is also not relevant. The relevant node should be ranked higher to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users but lacks detailed steps on setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` and specific instructions on following pages or users."
