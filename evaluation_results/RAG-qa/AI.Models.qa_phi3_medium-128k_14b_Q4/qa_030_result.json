  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the main response is relevant and helpful, but the inclusion of a URL that does not directly address the configuration question about team spaces and permissions in XWiki slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node explains the technical details of how spaces and pages are created and managed in XWiki, but it doesn't provide any information on how to set access controls for different teams. Similarly, the second node lists various macros and their functionalities in XWiki, which is unrelated to configuring access controls for team spaces.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, defining rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages."
