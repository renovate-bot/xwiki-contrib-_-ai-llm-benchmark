  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the answer addresses the configuration question about XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'a specific page in XWiki and its metadata', which does not relate to configuring access rights for team spaces. The second node talks about 'modifying resources using XML and HTTP methods', which is unrelated to setting access permissions in XWiki. The third node is about 'managing comments and attachments on XWiki pages', which does not pertain to access control configurations. The fourth node explains 'the concept of spaces and pages in XWiki', but does not provide information on configuring access rights for team spaces. The fifth node discusses 'actions needed after running a migrator and changes in XWiki APIs', which is not relevant to setting access permissions. Finally, the sixth node covers 'configuration display options in XWiki', which does not directly relate to setting access rights for team spaces.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete lack of relevant information.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, setting rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks specific steps like creating groups and setting rights at the wiki level. It introduces 'scope' and 'Contr\u00f4le d'acc\u00e8s' parameters not mentioned in the expected output, and doesn't mention inheriting rights for child pages."
