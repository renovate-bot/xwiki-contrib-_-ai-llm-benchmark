  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the question about configuring spaces in XWiki by providing some relevant information. However, it includes several irrelevant statements related to source links and topics not directly connected to the specific configuration question, which prevents a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.67 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than some irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'rights inheritance and administration features,' which is relevant to configuring permissions in XWiki. However, the second node, which is about 'parent/child relationship and the introduction of Nested Pages,' and the third node, which focuses on 'string formatting and OpenID Connect properties,' are not directly related to the input question and should be ranked lower. The fourth node provides information on 'XWiki's permission system,' which is directly relevant, and the sixth node discusses 'setting wiki-wide and page-level rights,' which is pertinent to the input. The presence of irrelevant nodes ranked higher than some relevant ones prevents a higher score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the expected output is supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Specifically, nodes in the retrieval context provide information on creating groups, setting wiki-wide and space-level rights, and inheriting rights for child pages, which correspond to sentences 1 through 4 in the expected output. However, there is no mention of adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces in the retrieval context, which affects the completeness of the information provided.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights at wiki and space levels and rights inheritance, but lacks details on creating groups for each team and specific steps for setting 'View' and 'Edit' rights as outlined in the expected output."
