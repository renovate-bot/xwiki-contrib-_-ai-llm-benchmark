  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response mostly addresses how to configure access rights in XWiki, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that an explicit denial does not block inheritance, while the retrieval context clarifies that when a right is allowed at a given level, it is implicitly denied to others at the same level.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.67 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than some irrelevant nodes, but not all. The first node discusses 'rights inheritance and administration features', which is relevant, and is correctly ranked higher. However, the second node, which focuses on 'the parent/child relationship and the introduction of nested pages', is irrelevant and should be ranked lower than the fourth node, which provides information on 'XWiki's permission system, including setting view and edit rights'. Additionally, the third node about 'string formatting and user identification' is also irrelevant and should be ranked lower than the sixth node, which explains 'basic rules for setting rights in XWiki'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the expected output sentences are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as creating groups, setting wiki-wide and space-level rights, and inheriting rights for child pages. However, there is a lack of specific mention in the retrieval context about adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces, which slightly affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions rights inheritance and setting rights at different levels, which aligns with setting space-level rights and inheriting rights for child pages. However, it lacks specific details about creating groups for each team and setting the 'View' right for 'XWikiAllGroup'.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output partially aligns with the expected output by setting 'View' rights at the wiki level and restricting edit rights to respective teams, but it includes unnecessary administrator rights details and lacks specific steps for group creation and child page inheritance."
