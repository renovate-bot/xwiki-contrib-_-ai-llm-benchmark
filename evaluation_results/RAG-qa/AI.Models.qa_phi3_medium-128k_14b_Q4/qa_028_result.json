  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the answer provides some relevant information but includes multiple irrelevant statements and links that do not directly address the specific question about limiting file types and sizes.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring file upload restrictions. For example, the first node discusses 'macros and preferences related to notifications, office document viewing, and PDF table of contents,' which are not pertinent to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about configuring MIME types or setting maximum attachment size."
