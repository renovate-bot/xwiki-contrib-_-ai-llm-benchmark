  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the response is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes repeated irrelevant statements about a source link that do not directly address how to enable notifications for one's own actions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node explains that 'by default, one don\u2019t receive notification about one\u2019s own activity' and mentions the ability to 'disable this filter in the \"Advanced filtering options\" section of your own notification settings,' which directly addresses the expected output. The second node states, 'By default, you won\u2019t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' which is relevant to the expected output. Irrelevant nodes, such as the third node discussing administrators configuring notifications, the fourth node about RSS feeds, and the fifth node providing general notification methods, are ranked lower, ensuring a perfect score. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context fully contains the information found in the expected answer, including the default behavior of not receiving notifications about one's own activity unless explicitly targeted, and the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the user's notification settings."
