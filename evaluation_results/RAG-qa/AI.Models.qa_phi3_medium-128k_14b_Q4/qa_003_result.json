  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the response partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly answer the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly states that the path to modify notification settings in XWiki is Administration > Notifications, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. Great job on getting the order spot on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, demonstrating perfect alignment.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the information found in the expected answer, including the default behavior of not receiving notifications about one's own activity unless explicitly targeted, and the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the notification settings.",
    "Correctness": "The Actual Output aligns with the Expected Output regarding default notification settings and user ability to change them. It provides additional clarity on how to modify these settings, which doesn't contradict the Expected Output. The mention of XWiki version 14.1+ is extra but not a factual inaccuracy."
