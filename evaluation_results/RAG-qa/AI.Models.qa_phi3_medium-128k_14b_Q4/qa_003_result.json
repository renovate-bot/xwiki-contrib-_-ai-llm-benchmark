  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, it includes a general reminder about the potential downside of notifications, which is not directly related to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and general notification settings, but does not mention enabling notifications for one's own actions. Similarly, the second node lists various notification settings and customization options but does not address receiving notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about not receiving notifications about one's own activity or the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the user profile.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions notification settings but does not specify the ability to disable the filter for one's own activity in the 'Advanced filtering options' section."
