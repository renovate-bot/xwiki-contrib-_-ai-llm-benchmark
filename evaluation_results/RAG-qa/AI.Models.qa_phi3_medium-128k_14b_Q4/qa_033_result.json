    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node is about 'upgrading XWiki' and lacks information on 'authenticating users with access tokens'. The second node discusses 'features related to users and rights' but does not cover 'authenticating users with access tokens'. The third node mentions 'managing user rights and profiles' without addressing 'authentication using access tokens'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete mismatch between the expected content and the provided context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication, JWT, or related configurations mentioned in the expected output."
