  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because while the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, it includes several URLs that are not directly relevant to the specific topic of using access tokens for authentication.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'describes properties and methods related to collections and their management,' which is not related to authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about authenticating users with access tokens, JWT, or the specific configuration steps mentioned in the expected output."
