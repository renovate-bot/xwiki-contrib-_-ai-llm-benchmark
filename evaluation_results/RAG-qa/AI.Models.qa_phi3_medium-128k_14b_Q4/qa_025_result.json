  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the configuration of OpenID Connect for automatic user account activation. However, it includes an irrelevant statement about the XWiki RESTful API, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts. Similarly, the second node discusses container authentication but lacks the specific configuration details needed for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain specific instructions about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
