  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response addresses the main question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect, but it includes repeated irrelevant source links that do not directly resolve the configuration issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.43 because the actual output incorrectly associates the setting xwiki.authentication.createuser=true with OpenID Connect, while the retrieval context does not specify this association. Additionally, the output mistakenly claims that new users are configured as 'context user' by default, contradicting the context which states users are created only if xwiki.authentication.createuser is set. Furthermore, the output incorrectly suggests setting xwiki.authentication.authclass for OpenID Connect user creation, whereas the context indicates this is for Container Authentication.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and cookie settings,' which is unrelated to enabling user accounts automatically with OpenID Connect. The second node covers 'container authentication and LDAP,' not mentioning the specific configuration needed for OpenID Connect user activation. The third node, while mentioning OpenID Connect, focuses on 'general authentication and configuration guides,' not on enabling user accounts automatically. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension,' which is not relevant to the specific configuration needed for automatic user activation. Lastly, the fifth node is about 'LDAP and Active Directory integration,' which does not relate to OpenID Connect user account activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the xwiki.properties file or the oidc.enableUser property, which are crucial for the expected answer.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output focuses on account creation, not activation, and uses xwiki.cfg instead of xwiki.properties. It mentions different properties and steps than expected output."
