  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant to the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes source links that do not directly address the setup process, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'general OpenID Connect provider configuration and endpoints' but does not address group synchronization, which is crucial for the input query. The second node is about 'container authentication' and lacks details on group synchronization. The third node mentions 'OpenID Connect authentication and synchronization' but does not provide specific instructions for group synchronization. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' without relating to group synchronization. Lastly, the fifth node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator' but lacks group synchronization details.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as there are no supportive reasons and multiple unsupportive reasons for each sentence.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks specific instructions on configuring group synchronization properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output focuses on installing and configuring the OpenID Connect Authenticator, whereas the expected output details specific properties in xwiki.properties for group synchronization. Key points like setting oidc.groups.claim, separator, and mapping are missing in actual output."
