  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant information included. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect provider configuration, but does not mention group synchronization or the specific properties needed for it.' The second node 'focuses on container authentication and other authentication methods like LDAP, without addressing group synchronization with OpenID Connect.' The third node 'mentions OpenID Connect authentication and provides links to configuration guides, it does not cover the specific steps or properties needed for group synchronization.' The fourth node 'lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect authenticator but does not provide any information relevant to group synchronization setup.' Finally, the fifth node 'provides general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator, including compatibility and installation, but does not mention group synchronization.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as all instructions and examples provided are not covered or mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about configuring group synchronization, properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, or `oidc.groups.mapping`, which are detailed in the expected output."
