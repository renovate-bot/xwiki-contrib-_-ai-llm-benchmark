  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the main content addresses the process of setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, but it includes several irrelevant statements that do not directly contribute to the explanation.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly instructs to go to 'Tools' and select 'Plugin Manager' to find 'OpenID Connector', which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node mentioning 'Group synchronization' and providing a link to more details is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the one in the first rank that primarily provides links to prerequisites and general descriptions, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is directly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization but lacks detailed steps and specific properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` found in the expected output."
