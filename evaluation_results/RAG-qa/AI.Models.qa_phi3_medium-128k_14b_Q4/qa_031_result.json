  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes multiple irrelevant source links and section headers that do not contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant ones. The first node, ranked 1, is irrelevant as it discusses 'LDAP configuration' and lacks mention of 'access tokens or JWT authentication.' The second node, ranked 2, is relevant because it covers 'Authorized Applications Configuration,' which pertains to using tokens for authentication. The third node, ranked 3, is irrelevant since it focuses on 'OpenID Connect scopes and response types,' not directly related to 'access tokens for authentication.' The fourth node, ranked 4, is relevant as it details 'JWT for authentication,' directly aligning with using access tokens. The fifth node, ranked 5, is irrelevant because it talks about 'different authentication mechanisms in XWiki' without specifically addressing 'access tokens or JWT.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key aspects of the expected output, such as the use of JWTs and configuration steps, are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specific details like generating a JWT token with required claims and including it in the 'Authorization' header are not directly mentioned.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and JWT token requirements, which aligns with the expected output. However, it lacks specific details about claims like expiration time, issuer, subject, and audience, and the use of the 'Authorization' header.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly describes enabling the token authenticator and mentions user creation based on token information, aligning with expected output. However, it misses details on token claims, Ed25519 key signing, and configuring authorized applications."
