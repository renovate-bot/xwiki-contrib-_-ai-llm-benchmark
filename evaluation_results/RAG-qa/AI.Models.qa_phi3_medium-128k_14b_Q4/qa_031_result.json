  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because while the output includes source links that could potentially be useful, it fails to directly address the question about authenticating users with access tokens, leading to a lack of direct relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because some relevant nodes are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node is about 'LDAP configuration' and does not mention token-based authentication, which should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node discusses 'OpenID Connect scopes and response types', unrelated to token-based authentication, and should also be ranked lower. The fifth node gives a general overview of 'XWiki's authentication mechanisms' without addressing token-based authentication, and should be ranked lower as well. However, the second and fourth nodes are correctly identified as relevant, discussing 'Authorized Applications Configuration' and 'authentication with JWT', respectively.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while the retrieval context nodes provide substantial information about authenticating users with JWTs, enabling the token authenticator, and configuring authorized applications, they lack specific details about generating a JWT token with required claims and including the token in the 'Authorization' header.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions using JWT for authentication and configuring authorized applications, aligning with the expected answer. However, details like specific claims in the token and the 'Authorization' header format are missing."
