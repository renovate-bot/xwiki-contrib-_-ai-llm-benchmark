  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management class and endpoints for OpenID Connect', the second node is about 'container authentication and other methods like LDAP', the third node describes 'the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', the fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', and the fifth node provides 'links to configuration guides and describes limitations'. None of these contexts address user profile field customization or mapping, which is the focus of the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context nodes mention 'xwiki.properties' and 'oidc.user.mapping', which support sentences 1 and 2 of the expected output, they do not cover specific details like 'myxproperty1', 'myxproperty2', or the steps of saving and restarting XWiki mentioned in sentences 3 and 4.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions OpenID Connect and xwiki.properties but lacks details on customizing user profile fields or using oidc.user.mapping as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output provides a general method for mapping user properties but lacks specific details on using `xwiki.properties` and `oidc.user.mapping` as mentioned in the expected output."
