  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because the output contains several irrelevant statements about unrelated topics like attachments, XWiki syntax, and security modules, which do not directly address the question about disabling notifications. However, the score is not lower because there might still be some relevant information regarding the actual question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'attaching files and related features', which is not about managing notifications. The second node talks about 'moving attachments and related actions', again unrelated to notification settings. The third node provides a 'list of macros and their functions', which does not pertain to disabling notifications. The fourth node describes an 'application for administrating wiki features', not involving notification management. The fifth node lists 'various extensions and their functionalities', none of which relate to notification settings. Finally, the sixth node lists 'various applications and their purposes', but none are about notification management.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be matched to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic page following or notification settings as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output discusses feedreader settings and steps unrelated to the expected output about automatic page tracking and notification settings."
