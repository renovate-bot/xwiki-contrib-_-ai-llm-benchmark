  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the response partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but includes irrelevant information such as unrelated source links and discussions about a 'No Notification' tag.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which explains 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is ranked first, while all irrelevant nodes are ranked lower. Great job on getting it perfectly right!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, with no discrepancies. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms users don't receive notifications for their own actions by default and mentions the ability to change this setting, aligning closely with the expected output. However, it does not explicitly mention 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' for changing settings.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output provides steps for notification settings not detailed in expected output and contains additional information on managing filters, which is not present in expected output. Both outputs mention default notification settings and the ability to modify them."
