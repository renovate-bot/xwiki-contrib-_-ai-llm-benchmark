  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response effectively addresses how to enable notifications for one's own actions, but it includes an irrelevant link to XWiki syntax documentation, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly claims that you can enable notifications for your own actions within an app, while the retrieval context clarifies that by default, you won't receive notifications for actions done by yourself.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is ranked first, directly addressing the input question about receiving notifications for one's own actions. Great job on ranking the relevant information at the top!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the second sentence about disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' is not found in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the ability to change this in settings, aligning closely with the expected output. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section."
