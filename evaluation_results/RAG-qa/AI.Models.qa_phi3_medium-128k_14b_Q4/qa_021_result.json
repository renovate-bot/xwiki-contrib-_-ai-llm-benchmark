  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the response partially addresses the issue of the unavailable bell icon, but includes irrelevant information such as source links and unrelated potential causes, which detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior', but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings, which is the core issue in the input. Similarly, the second node lists 'various links related to notification settings and preferences', yet fails to mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings. This pattern continues with the third node, which provides 'links to notification preferences and settings', but again does not address the enabling of notifications. The fourth node describes 'the alert menu and notification display', and the fifth node explains 'how to get an RSS feed of notifications and adjust notification settings', both of which also miss the crucial point of enabling notifications in the wiki settings. Thus, all nodes are ranked incorrectly as they do not provide relevant information to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context supports the mention of 'notifications' and 'wiki' in the first sentence of the expected output, none of the nodes provide information about 'xwiki.properties' or setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is necessary for the second sentence.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the 'xwiki.properties' file or setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true'.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not directly instruct on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties` as the expected output does. It instead suggests checking configuration, permissions, and technical errors without mentioning the specific property setting."
