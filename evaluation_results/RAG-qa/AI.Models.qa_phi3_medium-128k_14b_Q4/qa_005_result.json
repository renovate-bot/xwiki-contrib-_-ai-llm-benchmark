  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.98 because the response is highly relevant and addresses the OpenID Connect configuration issue effectively, with only a minor irrelevant mention of LDAP Authenticator, which slightly detracts from a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions the property '# oidc.enableUser=true' directly related to enabling user accounts on first login, is ranked first. This ensures that the most pertinent information is prioritized, making the retrieval highly effective. Great job on getting it spot on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context supports the information about the 'oidc.enableUser=true' property, it lacks details on adding or updating properties, uncommenting the property, restarting XWiki, and the automatic enabling of user accounts on first login.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the key information about uncommenting and setting the 'oidc.enableUser' property to 'true' in the xwiki.properties file, which matches the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions about saving the file and restarting the XWiki instance."
