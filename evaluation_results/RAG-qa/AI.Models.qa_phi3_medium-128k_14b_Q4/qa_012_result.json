  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes some irrelevant parts like a source link, a console command suggestion, and a closing statement that do not directly help with the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node contains 'a list of image links and does not provide any information related to notifications or their settings', the second node 'contains image links and references to various projects, which do not relate to the topic of enabling notifications', and the third node is 'a series of image links and references, offering no relevant information about notification settings or issues'. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than any relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains image links and references that do not match any information in the expected output about enabling notifications or following pages and users.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks specific instructions like setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` to `true` and following pages or users. It introduces unrelated steps like checking 'Admin-Verzeichnis' and using a 'Konsolenbefehl'."
