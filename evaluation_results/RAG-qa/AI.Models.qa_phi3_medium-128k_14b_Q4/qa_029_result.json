  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.62 because the response partially addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output incorrectly suggests changing the 'Script' permission to 'DENY' for all users, while the retrieval context already states that the 'Script' right is set to DENY by default, making the suggestion unnecessary.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node in the retrieval context is about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', which does not relate to script rights or administrative permissions, yet it is ranked higher than relevant nodes. Additionally, the fourth node discusses 'checking access rights programmatically' and the fifth node is about 'executing code with specific user rights', neither of which directly address the issue of refusing script rights to an administrator. However, the second and third nodes are correctly identified as relevant, as they discuss 'programming and script rights' and provide a 'detailed list of rights', supporting the expected output.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context, showing a clear understanding and accurate recall. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that admin rights are not deniable, but it lacks specific information about XWiki not supporting the refusal of rights implied by admin rights.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides steps to modify script rights, which contradicts the expected output stating admin rights cannot be denied in XWiki. No mention is made of admin rights' immutability as highlighted in the expected output."
