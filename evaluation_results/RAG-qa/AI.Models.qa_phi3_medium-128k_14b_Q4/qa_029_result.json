  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the main content addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but the inclusion of multiple source links that do not directly answer the question slightly detracts from the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Everything aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context, which is relevant as it 'discusses programming and script rights, indicating that script rights are part of the admin rights and cannot be denied separately,' is ranked lower than the first node, which is irrelevant since it is 'about language preferences and translations in XWiki, which is unrelated to script rights or administrative permissions.' Additionally, other irrelevant nodes such as the third node, which 'lists various rights and their default states but does not specifically address the inability to deny script rights to an admin,' are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the information in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions rights like ADMIN and their implications but does not explicitly state that administrator rights cannot be refused, which is the key information in the expected output."
