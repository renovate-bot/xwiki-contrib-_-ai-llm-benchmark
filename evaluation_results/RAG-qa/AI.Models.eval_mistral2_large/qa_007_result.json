  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.81 because the first node provides crucial information on setting the `oidc.groups.claim` property, which is essential for synchronizing groups. However, the second node, which discusses domain-based authentication and session cookies, is not relevant and should be ranked lower. The third node is correctly ranked as it explains the default group synchronization and mapping using the `oidc.groups.mapping` property. The fourth node is also relevant, detailing the `oidc.groups.separator` property for group memberships. The fifth node, which provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator and its installation, is not directly relevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context nodes mention configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, they do not cover key steps such as locating and opening the `xwiki.properties` file, providing specific examples, or saving and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and general OpenID Connect setup, but does not address the specific process of configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and all provided contradictions actually indicate alignment between the actual output and the context, showing no evidence of hallucination."
