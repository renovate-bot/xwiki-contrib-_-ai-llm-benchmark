  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer provides useful information but includes irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the question about disabling notifications, and one of the URLs is a duplicate.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first node is relevant and directly related to the automatic activation of notifications. However, irrelevant nodes like the second node, discussing email notifications configuration, and the third node, about notification RSS feeds, are ranked higher than the fourth node, which is relevant and discusses how users can enable or disable different types of notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses email notifications, RSS feeds, and technical details about XWiki, none of which address the user's question about disabling general notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks specific details and relevant information mentioned in the context, leading to a high level of misalignment."
