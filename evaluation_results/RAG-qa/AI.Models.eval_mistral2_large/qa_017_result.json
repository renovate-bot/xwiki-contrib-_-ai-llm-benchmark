  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the majority of the response is highly relevant to the question about setting up group synchronization with an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes some irrelevant details about scalability, performance, and second-generation wiki features of XWiki, which slightly detract from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly claims that group synchronization configuration can be done through `xwiki.properties` or `xwiki.cfg`, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides general information about OpenID Connect integration with XWiki, but does not detail the specific steps required to set up group synchronization. The second node discusses domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration, which is not relevant to setting up group synchronization. The third node provides information about XWiki's scalability and multi-tenancy, which is unrelated to the process of configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The fourth node describes the features of first-generation wikis and their functionalities, which does not pertain to the group synchronization setup process. The fifth node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension, which is not directly useful for understanding how to configure group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various unrelated topics such as general OpenID Connect authentication, domain-based authentication, and XWiki's multi-tenancy capabilities, but does not address the specific process of synchronizing group claims between an OpenID Connect provider and XWiki groups.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, such as domain-based instance configuration, session cookie domain settings, scalability and multi-tenancy of XWiki, distinction between first and second generation wikis, and dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension. However, it does correctly provide a link to the OpenID Connect Authenticator page."
