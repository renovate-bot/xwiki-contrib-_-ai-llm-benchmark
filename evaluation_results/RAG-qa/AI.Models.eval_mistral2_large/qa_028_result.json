  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the core information about configuring attachment validation is present and useful, but several links provided are not directly relevant to the specific question about restricting file types and sizes.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'programming rights and permissions in XWiki', the second node talks about 'cookie protection and authentication strategies', the third node mentions 'dependencies for an extension', the fourth node is about 'configuring OpenOffice server settings', and the fifth node describes 'the XWiki dataset structure'. None of these contexts provide information on configuring file upload restrictions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses permissions, security settings, dependencies, and configurations unrelated to file upload restrictions, such as 'A programmer is allowed to execute arbitrary Java code in the wiki' and 'The context provided is about configuring and starting an OpenOffice server for XWiki'.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output completely diverges from the context, focusing on attachment validation settings instead of the various topics described in the context, such as programming rights, protection levels, dependencies, OpenOffice server configuration, and the XWiki dataset."
