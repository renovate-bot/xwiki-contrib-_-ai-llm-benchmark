  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because while the answer addresses the customization of user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki, it includes several irrelevant links to unrelated documentation, which detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is not relevant to mapping user profile fields from OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context provide information related to customizing user profile fields, the `oidc.user.mapping` property, or the steps to save and restart XWiki.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various unrelated topics such as domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and XWiki's scalability, but does not address customizing or mapping user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the contexts, indicating that the actual output is entirely focused on mapping user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider and does not deviate into unrelated topics."
