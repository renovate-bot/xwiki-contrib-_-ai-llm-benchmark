  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant to the issue of the notification bell not being available, but it includes links to XWiki syntax and features documentation, which are not directly related to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions that 'The extension status can be toggled by editing the configuration variable \"notifications.enabled\" in xwiki.properties and restarting the server,' is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes discussing 'changes displayed in email content and user profile settings' (first node) and 'getting a notification RSS feed and the Notifications Macro' (second node) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses email notifications, user settings, and macros, which are irrelevant to the input about the bell icon and 'Alert Notification' extension.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output fails to mention several key details from the contexts, such as the notification RSS feed, specific macros for handling user settings, email notification settings, and additional features like the Menu and Notification applications. Although there is some alignment regarding the configuration of the Notifications Application, the majority of the context details are missing, resulting in a high hallucination score."
