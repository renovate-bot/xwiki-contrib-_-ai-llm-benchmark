  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which contains the exact property `oidc.enableUser=true` that needs to be set in the `xwiki.properties` file to enable user accounts upon first login, is ranked fifth. Irrelevant nodes discussing domain-based instances and session cookies (first node), general information about OpenID Connect (second node), dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension (third node), and logging configurations and prerequisites for installation (fourth node) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because only the sentence about the 'oidc.enableUser' property (sentence 2) is supported by the 5th node in the retrieval context, while other instructions like adding/updating the property, uncommenting it, saving the file, restarting XWiki, and the outcome of enabling new user accounts are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses domain-based instance configuration, session cookie settings, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output fails to mention several key details from the context, such as domain-based instance configuration, session cookie configuration, prerequisites, installation instructions, automatic synchronization with the OpenID Connect provider, dependencies for the extension, Logging Admin UI, and Logback configuration file. However, it correctly mentions the property `oidc.enableUser` setting in the `xwiki.cfg` file."
