  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer includes several URLs that are not directly relevant to the issue with the notification bell, which detracts from the overall relevance. However, the answer still addresses the main concern to some extent.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the 'Script' right must be enabled for certain functionalities, while the retrieval context clarifies that a script will only execute if the last author of the page has the 'Script' right.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'provides general information about the Menu application and other features but does not address the issue of the notification bell not being available or how to enable notifications.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context nodes mention displaying notifications in the wiki (supporting the first sentence), but none of the nodes mention defining the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` (unsupporting the second sentence).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the issue of the bell icon's availability despite the 'Notification d'alerte' extension being installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks numerous specific details mentioned in the context, including features, notification preferences, macros, instructions, access rights, permissions, prerequisites, and installation instructions. There are no contradictions, but the absence of these details indicates a high level of hallucination."
