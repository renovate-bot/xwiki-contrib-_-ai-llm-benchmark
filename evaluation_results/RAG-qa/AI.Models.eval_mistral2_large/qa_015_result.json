  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and addresses the configuration of automatic user activation with OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, the mention of the Accessibility features documentation is slightly off-topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is unrelated to automatically activating user accounts with OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator,' but does not address the specific configuration needed. The third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' which is not relevant. The fourth node discusses 'accessibility guidelines and automated tests for XWiki,' which is unrelated. The fifth node provides information on 'creating custom authentication methods,' but does not address the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because while the retrieval context mentions the relevance of the xwiki.properties file for OpenID Connect configuration (node 2), it lacks details on adding or updating specific properties, the specific property 'oidc.enableUser', ensuring it is uncommented and set to true, restarting the XWiki instance, and automatic activation of new user accounts.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various unrelated topics such as domain-based instance configuration, session cookie settings, and accessibility efforts, none of which address the specific question about automatically activating user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.40 because the actual output aligns with the context regarding OpenID Connect authentication and configuration, but it fails to mention accessibility features and custom authentication, which are also part of the context."
