  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the answer is mostly relevant to the input, but it includes several URLs that are unrelated to the topic of notifications, which slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses the configuration of blocked attachment mimetypes, which is unrelated to notification settings. The second node describes protection levels for cookies and authentication strategies, which do not pertain to notification settings. The third node explains various user rights like programming, register, create wikis, and script rights, which are not relevant to notification settings. The fourth node covers comment, edit, delete, and special permissions, none of which are related to notification settings. The fifth node discusses directory cleanup and database attachment store settings, which are not relevant to notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses attachment mimetype restrictions, security configurations, and various permissions, all of which are irrelevant to the input 'Ich erhalte keine Benachrichtigungen.'",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently omits critical details provided in the context, such as configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, specific authentication strategies, detailed access rights, and information about directory cleanup and database attachment store settings."
