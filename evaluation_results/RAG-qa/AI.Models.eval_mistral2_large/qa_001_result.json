  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the response mostly addresses the issue with the 'Bell' icon and the Alert Notification extension, but includes some irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about the Menu application and other features, but does not address enabling notifications. Additionally, the second node is about the 'What's New Application' and does not provide information on enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context discusses notifications generally, it does not specifically mention the `notifications.enabled` setting or `xwiki.properties`, which are crucial details in the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the availability of the 'Bell' icon or the 'Alert Notification' extension as mentioned in the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the context. The actual output correctly aligns with the context by discussing the Notifications Application and its features."
