    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the specific question about enabling notifications for one's own actions on XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node lists various notification preferences macros but does not address the user's question about enabling notifications for their own actions. Similarly, the second node discusses email notifications and their configurations but does not provide information on enabling notifications for the user's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the information provided in the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various notification settings and technical details in XWiki but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating that the information is accurate and well-aligned."
