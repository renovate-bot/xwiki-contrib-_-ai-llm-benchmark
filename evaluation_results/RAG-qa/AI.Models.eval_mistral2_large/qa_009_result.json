  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer provides relevant information but includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims that denying the script right to a space administrator will prevent them from executing user-written scripts within that space, while the retrieval context does not specify this consequence.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the question. For example, the first node discusses programming rights and their implications, which does not address the specific question. The second node deals with color themes and access for unregistered users, which is unrelated. The third node explains comment rights, edit rights, and delete rights, but not script rights. The fourth node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and access decisions, but not script rights. The fifth node provides a table of right constants and their properties, but does not address the question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output, with clear alignment to the nodes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses various rights and configurations but does not mention anything about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and all provided contradictions are actually consistent with the context, indicating no hallucinations."
