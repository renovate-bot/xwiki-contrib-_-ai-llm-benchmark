  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer mostly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes several irrelevant URLs that do not directly pertain to the topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.62 because the actual output introduces constraints and details not mentioned in the retrieval context, such as the use of the Ed25519 algorithm for key generation and specific requirements for 'exp', 'iss', and 'iat' claims.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the first node, which is irrelevant, is ranked higher than the second node, which is relevant. The first node discusses 'the Reference Form and Questionnaire Form on XWiki.org, which is unrelated to authenticating users with access tokens.' However, the second node provides details on 'JWT token generation and the necessary claims,' which are directly relevant. Additionally, other irrelevant nodes such as the third node discussing 'the AuthorizationSettler and right definitions' are ranked higher than the relevant second node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some details about JWT token requirements and usage (sentences 2 and 4) are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, specific steps for enabling the token authenticator, configuring applications, and limitations on user creation (sentences 1, 3, and 5) are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses form utilization, AuthorizationSettler, ConfigurableClass objects, and various wiki applications, which are all unrelated to the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output omits several key elements mentioned in the context, such as the Reference Form, Questionnaire Form, AuthorizationSettler, ConfigurableClass objects, and various features like the Menu application, Notifications, and Invitation. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
