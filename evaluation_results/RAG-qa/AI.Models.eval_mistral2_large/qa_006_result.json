  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer mostly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki, but includes irrelevant links to the LDAP Authenticator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes, ensuring precise and accurate retrieval.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.83 because most of the content in the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, except for the part about saving the `xwiki.properties` file and restarting XWiki.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context provided discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but does not address customizing or mapping user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output fails to mention several key aspects that are the focus of the provided context, such as authentication with a domain-based instance, session cookie configuration in Tomcat, group synchronization, custom group synchronization, templates and listeners, `oidc.groups.mapping` property, allowed or forbidden groups, group prefix, group memberships, LDAP group synchronization, LDAP attributes, and LDAP fields mapping. There is only one alignment regarding the `oidc.user.mapping` property."
