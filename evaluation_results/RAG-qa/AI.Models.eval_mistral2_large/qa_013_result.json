  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the provided URLs do not directly address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, the answer is still partially relevant as it attempts to provide useful resources.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'various applications and features in XWiki' and does not address enabling notifications for one's own activity. Similarly, the second node discusses 'AuthorizationSettler and access decisions', which are unrelated to the input. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than any relevant nodes, resulting in a low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, demonstrating a clear and accurate match.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various unrelated topics such as authorization, attachment mimetypes, and access control, none of which address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output lacks significant details about several key features and configurations mentioned in the context, such as the Menu application, Notifications application, Invitation application, AuthorizationSettler, right definitions, blocked attachment mimetypes, and access violation logging. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
