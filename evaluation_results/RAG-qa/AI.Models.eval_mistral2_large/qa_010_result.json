  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but the repeated URL does not directly address the specific configuration of view and edit rights in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.95 because the actual output incorrectly claims that permissions set at the space level override wiki-wide permissions, whereas the retrieval context specifies that it is permissions set at the page level that override wiki-wide permissions.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.45 because irrelevant nodes like the first node, which discusses 'how spaces and sub-spaces are created in XWiki,' and the third node, which is 'about executing a plan for migrating nested pages,' are ranked higher than relevant nodes that provide information on setting access rights. However, the score is not lower because some relevant nodes, such as the second node, which 'provides information on the permission system in XWiki,' are correctly identified.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly aligns with all the steps and details mentioned in the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the context explains space creation and management, migration plans, and features like authentication mechanisms, but it does not address configuring team permissions in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.60 because the actual output misses several key concepts such as 'Terminal Pages', the execution of a plan or migration process, and various authentication mechanisms, which are present in the context. However, it correctly aligns with the context in explaining permissions and configuring rights."
