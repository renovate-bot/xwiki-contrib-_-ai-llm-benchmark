    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which provides detailed information on the JWT token requirements, is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes discussing blocked attachment mimetypes, custom authentication using a Groovy script, cookie protection levels and IP address usage for login, and programming rights and permissions within the wiki are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some sentences in the expected output can be attributed to nodes in the retrieval context, several sentences cannot be directly linked to any specific part of the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses topics like blocked attachment mimetypes, custom authentication methods, and various permissions, none of which are relevant to authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions, indicating that the actual output is consistent with the provided context."
