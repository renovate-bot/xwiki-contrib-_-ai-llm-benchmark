  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but the inclusion of the link 'https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Attachment/Validation/UI/' is not directly related to managing script rights for a space administrator in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) is ranked lower than multiple irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'Color Themes, access rights, and issues related to unregistered users,' which are not relevant to the question about script rights for an administrator. Similarly, the second node explains 'comment rights, edit rights, and delete rights,' but does not address script rights for an administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the information provided in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses Color Themes, icon fonts, and general wiki access rights, which are irrelevant to the input question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.40 because, while the actual output aligns with the context on managing access rights and permissions, it fails to mention programming rights, implied rights, and inheritance, which are crucial parts of the context. This partial alignment and omission of key details result in a moderate hallucination score."
