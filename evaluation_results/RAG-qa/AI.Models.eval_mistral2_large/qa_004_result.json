  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides a clear solution to disabling notifications, but it includes an unnecessary link to XWiki syntax documentation.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.95 because the majority of relevant nodes are ranked higher, such as the first node discussing custom filters and the second node mentioning 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences'. However, the fourth node, which discusses getting a notification RSS feed, is not directly relevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, specifically node 5.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is highly relevant and there are no reasons provided for irrelevancy. Great job!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.20 because the actual output aligns well with the context in explaining how to manage notification filters, create custom filters, and access notification settings. However, it lacks specific references to the macros listed in the context, which slightly reduces its accuracy."
