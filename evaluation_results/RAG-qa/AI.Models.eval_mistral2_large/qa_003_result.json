  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the provided answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes links that are not directly related to enabling notifications for one's own actions, slightly detracting from its overall usefulness.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output mentions using the `notificationsCustomFiltersPreferences` macro, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'lists various notification-related macros and their descriptions but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions', and the second node 'describes different ways to receive notifications in XWiki but does not provide information on enabling notifications for one's own actions'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports all the sentences in the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not directly address how to enable notifications for one's own actions, focusing instead on unrelated notification preferences and features.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating that the information provided is entirely accurate and aligned with the context."
