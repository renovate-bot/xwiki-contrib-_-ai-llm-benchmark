  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information, but the inclusion of a link about creating new users in XWiki slightly detracts from the focus on configuring group synchronization with an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is relevant, is correctly ranked higher and mentions 'default group synchronization' and 'properties in the `xwiki.properties` file, such as `oidc.groups.mapping`'. However, the first, third, fourth, and fifth nodes are irrelevant as they provide 'general information about prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies', 'general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator', 'various endpoints, customization options, and troubleshooting steps', and 'a link to more information about managing users and groups in XWiki' respectively, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.43 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks detailed instructions such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, replacing placeholders with actual values, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring group synchronization in the xwiki.properties file and using properties like oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks detailed steps and examples found in the expected output."
