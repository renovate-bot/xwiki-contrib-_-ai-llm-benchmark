  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which 'directly addresses group synchronization, mentioning the use of the 'oidc.groups.mapping' property', is ranked fourth. However, it should be ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node 'discusses authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints, but does not address group synchronization or the specific configuration steps needed for it', making it less relevant to the input question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.54 because while the 4th node in the retrieval context provides detailed information on configuring group synchronization, including properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', it lacks specific instructions found in the expected output, such as locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, replacing placeholder values, and saving changes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using 'oidc.groups.mapping', but lacks details on 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.separator' configurations found in the expected output."
