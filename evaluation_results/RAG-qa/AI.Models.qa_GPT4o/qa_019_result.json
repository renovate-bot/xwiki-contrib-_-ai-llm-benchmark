  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the main content effectively addresses how to deny script rights to a space administrator, but the inclusion of multiple source links that do not directly answer the question slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'form validation' and does not address denying script rights. The second node is about 'template providers and page creation', unrelated to script rights management. The third node contains 'technical code snippets for configuration', not related to rights management. The fourth node involves 'user registration and validation', which is not relevant to denying script rights. The fifth node discusses 'access rights and execution context' but does not specifically address the denial of script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output mentions admin rights in XWiki, but none of the nodes in the retrieval context provide information about admin rights or their implications.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about XWiki's admin rights or their limitations, which is the main focus of the expected answer."
