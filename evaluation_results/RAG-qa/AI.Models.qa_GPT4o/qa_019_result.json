  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.72 because the answer partially addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not relate to the topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node contains a link to an image and references to various projects, which are not related to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. Additionally, the second node discusses authentication methods and configurations, including Kerberos and LDAP, which are not relevant to the question about script rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output discusses XWiki's rights management limitations, which are not covered in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about admin rights or their implications in XWiki."
