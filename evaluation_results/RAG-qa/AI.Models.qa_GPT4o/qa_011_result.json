    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'how to get a notification RSS feed and manage notification settings,' which does not address the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki. Similarly, the second node is about 'overriding default notification templates and installation instructions,' which is also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through `xwiki.properties` or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, nor does it provide any information about the `xwiki.properties` file or the `notifications.enabled` setting.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`."
