  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes, such as the second node, which 'provides information on configuring authorized applications', and the fourth node, which 'describes the requirements for JWT tokens', are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node 'discusses LDAP authentication settings', which is unrelated to token-based authentication using JWTs, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, showcasing a perfect alignment. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes details about JWT token requirements, authorized applications configuration, and the use of Ed25519 keys, matching most of the expected output. However, it lacks explicit mention of the xwiki.authentication.authclass property setting."
