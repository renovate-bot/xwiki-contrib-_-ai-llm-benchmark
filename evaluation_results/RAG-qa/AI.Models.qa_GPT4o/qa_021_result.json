  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the issue of the notification bell not being available, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked 4th, mentions the configuration variable 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties', which is directly relevant to enabling notifications. However, it is ranked lower than three irrelevant nodes that discuss 'custom notification filters and their behavior', 'links and descriptions of various notification preferences', and 'filters for notifications and technical pages', none of which address enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context explicitly mentions enabling notifications by setting 'notifications.enabled' to true in xwiki.properties, which matches the expected output."
