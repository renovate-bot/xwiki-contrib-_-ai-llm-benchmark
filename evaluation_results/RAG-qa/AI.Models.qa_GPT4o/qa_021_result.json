  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant to the issue of the notification bell not being available, but it includes an unnecessary link to XWiki syntax documentation, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions enabling notifications with 'notifications.enabled = true' in the xwiki.properties file, is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'custom notification filters and their behavior', should be ranked lower as they do not address enabling notifications in the wiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the exact information about enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`, as found in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes the key fact about setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', but adds extra steps not in the expected output, and sources are unrelated."
