  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is highly relevant and helpful in addressing how to enable notifications for one's own actions. However, it includes a link to XWiki syntax documentation, which is not directly related to the query, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states 'By default, you won\u2019t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is ranked first. This directly addresses the input question about not receiving notifications for one's own activity and how to enable them. Great job on getting it spot on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only the first sentence of the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, while the information about disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' is not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the ability to change this setting, aligning closely with the expected output. However, it doesn't explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output matches most factual elements of the expected output, such as not receiving notifications for own activity by default and the ability to disable this filter. However, the actual output provides additional procedural details not present in the expected output."
