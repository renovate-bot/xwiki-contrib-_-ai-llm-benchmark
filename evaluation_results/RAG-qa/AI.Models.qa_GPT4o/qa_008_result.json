  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the output mostly addresses the question about setting upload restrictions, but includes links to general XWiki concepts and configurations that aren't directly related to the specific requirement of restricting attachments to images or PDFs of a certain size.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node, which 'mentions setting limits on the maximum size of an attachment and provides steps to change it', is ranked fifth. This indicates that irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'linking to external files and images', the second node providing 'a general overview of XWiki's structure and features', and the third node explaining 'how to add attachments using the XWiki interface', are ranked higher than the relevant information. These irrelevant nodes do not address configuring upload restrictions or size limits, which is why the score is not higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some nodes in the retrieval context provide relevant information about configuring xwiki.properties and setting maximum attachment size (nodes 5 and 6), they do not fully cover all the steps and details mentioned in the expected output, such as the specific line for mimetype restrictions and saving changes for subwikis.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details on configuring xwiki.properties or setting size to 10MB as in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly details setting the maximum upload size and mentions mimetype restrictions but suggests using the Attachment Validation Application instead of directly editing the xwiki.properties file for mimetype restrictions, potentially misleading from the expected method."
