  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the response is mostly relevant and addresses the customization of user profile fields in XWiki, but it includes source links that do not directly answer the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'various authentication methods including OpenID Connect' but lacks information on 'customizing user profile fields or mapping them in the xwiki.properties file.' The second node focuses on 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is unrelated to the input query. Subsequent nodes continue to miss the topic of 'customization of user profile fields' or 'oidc.user.mapping,' leading to a complete mismatch with the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while there are nodes in the retrieval context that relate to customizing user profile fields with OpenID Connect (node 3) and using 'oidc.user.mapping' (node 7), the example mappings, variable replacements, and instructions to save and restart XWiki are not explicitly supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions the xwiki.properties file and OpenID Connect, but lacks details on customizing user profile fields or using oidc.user.mapping."
