  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the response is highly relevant and addresses the main question about configuring OpenID Connect for automatic user activation. However, it includes a mention of LDAP Authenticator, which is not directly related to the query, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', which does not address enabling user accounts automatically on first login. The second node provides information about 'OpenID Connect endpoints and headers', but lacks details on user account activation settings. Subsequent nodes continue to focus on unrelated topics such as 'configuration guides', 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', and 'LDAP and Active Directory integration', none of which pertain to the specific issue of user account activation during first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the nodes in retrieval context support the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and 'oidc.enableUser' (sentence 1 and 2), they do not directly support the specific instructions for adding or updating properties (sentence 3) or ensuring new user accounts are activated (sentence 5).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any mention of adjusting the xwiki.properties file or the specific property oidc.enableUser, which is crucial for the expected answer."
