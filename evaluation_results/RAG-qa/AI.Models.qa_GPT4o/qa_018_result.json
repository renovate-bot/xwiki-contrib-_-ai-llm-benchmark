  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because the response partially addresses the input question about configuring upload settings, but the presence of multiple irrelevant source links prevents a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions; the actual output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.27 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the fifth node which includes sections on 'Size Limit' and 'Mimetype Restriction', and the sixth node which provides steps to set the maximum size of an attachment, are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', the second node covers 'ODT and PDF export features', and the third node lists configurations like 'WebDAV and PDF export', none of which are related to configuring attachment restrictions, yet they are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide detailed steps for configuring MIME types and setting maximum upload sizes, there are missing direct mentions of specific configurations such as the exact MIME type restriction line and the overall instruction about uploading only images or PDFs with a maximum size of 10 MB.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions but lacks specific details on setting MIME types in xwiki.properties and exact steps for setting size to 10 MB.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes the correct steps for setting maximum upload size but deviates by suggesting the Attachment Validation Application for MIME type restriction instead of editing `xwiki.properties` as in the expected output."
