  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the response mostly addresses the question about configuring upload restrictions for images or PDFs, but it includes irrelevant links to pages about exports, document lifecycle, and XWiki syntax, which do not directly relate to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides information on setting the maximum size of an attachment and mentions MIME type restrictions, is ranked sixth. This is lower than several irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', the second node about 'ODT and PDF export features', and the third node listing 'various configuration topics like WebDAV and PDF export', which should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.55 because while the steps related to configuring the maximum upload size (sentences 2-5) are well-supported by the 6th node in the retrieval context, the initial instructions about MIME type configuration (sentence 1) are not supported by any node in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details on configuring MIME types in xwiki.properties and setting the size to 10 MB as described in the expected output."
