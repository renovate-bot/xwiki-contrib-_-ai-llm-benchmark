  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the response largely addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes repeated irrelevant source links that do not directly answer the query, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node is about 'upgrading XWiki' and does not mention authentication or access tokens. The second node discusses 'features related to users and rights' but not authentication with access tokens. The third node mentions 'user authentication' but lacks information on using access tokens. The fourth node is about 'rights management' and is unrelated to authentication with access tokens. Lastly, the fifth node lists 'different rights and their properties', which is also irrelevant to the use of access tokens for authentication.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context lacks any mention of key concepts such as 'authentifier les utilisateurs avec des jetons d'acc\u00e8s', 'applications externes', or 'jetons Web JSON sign\u00e9s (JWT)'.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to token-based authentication or JWT, which is the focus of the expected answer.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not address the specific requirement of using the JWTTokenAuth extension for authentication as outlined in the expected output. It mentions potential support through extensions but lacks details on activating the authenticator or configuring allowed applications."
