  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a general description of the notification module that does not directly address the specific issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) that mentions the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses notification RSS feed settings but does not address enabling notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file, and the second node explains overriding notification templates and extension installation without mentioning the `xwiki.properties` file.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context explicitly mentions setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' to 'true', which matches the expected answer."
