  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the first node in the retrieval context is directly related to customizing user profile fields, mentioning 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and providing an example of mapping. All irrelevant nodes, such as the second node discussing 'access tokens and scopes' and the third node focused on 'group synchronization and custom claims', are ranked lower, ensuring high precision. Great job maintaining perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the main concept of mapping user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider is supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specific instructions such as replacing placeholders and restarting XWiki are not explicitly found in the context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the information from the expected answer, including customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties` and the example mappings provided.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly describes the customization of user profile fields through the 'oidc.user.mapping' property and provides examples of mapping, following the expected output closely. However, it includes an additional note on using transformations like '.lowerCase', which is not mentioned in the expected output."
