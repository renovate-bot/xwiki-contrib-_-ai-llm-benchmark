  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the answer partially addresses the question but includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not directly help with customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly states that the `xwiki.properties` file needs to be edited to set the OIDC authenticator class, while the retrieval context specifies that the configuration key xwiki.authentication.authclass must be defined in xwiki.cfg.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator but does not address customizing user profile fields or mapping additional fields. Similarly, the second node explains different authentication methods for the XWiki RESTful API but does not provide information on customizing or mapping user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about customizing user profile fields or mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file."
