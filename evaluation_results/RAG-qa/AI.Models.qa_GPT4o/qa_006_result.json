  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the answer largely addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki. However, it includes a source link and mentions available variables, which do not directly contribute to solving the specific query about mapping additional fields, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}' directly relating to mapping additional user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties, is ranked first. All irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing access to various claims, group synchronization, authentication management, and general OpenID Connect guides, are ranked lower, demonstrating perfect contextual precision.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the mapping of user profile fields and provides examples, but it does not mention the need to save the xwiki.properties file and restart XWiki to apply the changes, which is why the score is not perfect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains detailed instructions on customizing user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, matching the expected output."
