  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.37 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses enabling and disabling the notification module and email notifications at the administrator level, which is not directly related to the user's question about disabling notifications for specific pages. Similarly, the second node explains how to get a notification RSS feed and the settings for notifications, but it does not address how to disable notifications for specific pages. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the third node, which mentions 'Watch and custom filters,' relevant to the user's question. Additionally, the fourth node describes the 'Clear All' link and grouping of notifications, which does not directly address how to disable notifications for specific pages, and should be ranked lower than the fifth node, which mentions 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode,' directly relevant to the user's question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions notifications for pages created or updated by users (supporting sentence 1), it lacks information on 'Automatic page watching' and deleting existing notification filters (unsupporting sentences 3 and 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and custom filters but lacks details about automatic page watching and changing settings in the user profile."
