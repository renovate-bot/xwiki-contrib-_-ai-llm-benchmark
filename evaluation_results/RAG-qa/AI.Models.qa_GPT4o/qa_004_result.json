  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information on disabling notifications in XWiki. However, the inclusion of a source link without directly addressing the specific question slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked sixth, 'mentions that users only get notifications for pages they created or updated and discusses notification settings', which is pertinent to disabling notifications. However, several irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, such as the first node that 'discusses following a user and default watch settings, which is not directly related to disabling notifications for pages', and the second node that 'talks about selecting the level of details in email notifications and macros for settings, which does not address disabling notifications'. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because most of the expected output is supported by node 5 in the retrieval context, which discusses automatic page watching, changing settings, and managing custom filters. However, it lacks specific mention of being notified about changes on one's work.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings but lacks specific details about automatic page watching and deleting notification filters as described in the expected output."
