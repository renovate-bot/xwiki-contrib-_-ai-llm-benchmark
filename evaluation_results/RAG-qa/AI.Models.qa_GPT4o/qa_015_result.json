  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node describes general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, its developer, and its installation, but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts. The second node provides links to various configuration guides and examples but does not mention the specific configuration change needed in `xwiki.properties` to automatically activate user accounts. The third node lists various endpoints and other unrelated configurations, but does not provide the specific configuration needed for automatic user activation. The fourth node discusses container authentication and other unrelated authentication methods, but does not mention the `xwiki.properties` configuration required for automatic user activation. Finally, the fifth node mentions configuration files including `xwiki.properties`, but does not provide the specific property (`oidc.enableUser`) that needs to be set to `true` for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and OpenID Connect authentication in the 2nd node in the retrieval context supports the expected output, while specific instructions, property details, and procedural steps are missing.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
