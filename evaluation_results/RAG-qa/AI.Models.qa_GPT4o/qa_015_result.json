  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output perfectly addresses the input query without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly states that setting `xwiki.authentication.createuser=1` in the `xwiki.cfg` file ensures automatic creation of new user accounts, whereas the retrieval context specifies that it should be set to `empty` for creating users.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', which does not relate to 'automatically activating user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect'. The second node mentions 'container authentication and various authentication methods', but fails to address the specific configuration for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect. Similarly, the third node, despite mentioning OpenID Connect, focuses on 'authentication and synchronization', not the required configuration for automatic user activation. The fourth node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator without mentioning the configuration for automatic user activation. The fifth node discusses various OpenID Connect endpoints but omits the specific property 'oidc.enableUser' necessary for automatic user activation. The sixth node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension, which is unrelated to the configuration needed. Lastly, the seventh node covers 'features and troubleshooting' for the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the configuration for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context supports the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and configuration changes related to OpenID Connect, it lacks details on specific property updates, the procedure for saving and restarting XWiki, and the outcome of automatic user account activation.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the `oidc.enableUser` property or its configuration in `xwiki.properties`, which is essential to the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output suggests modifying xwiki.cfg instead of xwiki.properties for automatic user activation, a discrepancy with the expected output. It also includes additional steps like checking authentication class and OpenID provider, which are not mentioned in the expected output."
