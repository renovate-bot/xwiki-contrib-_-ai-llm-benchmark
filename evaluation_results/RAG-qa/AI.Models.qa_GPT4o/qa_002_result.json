  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the fourth rank discusses the 'notifications.enabled' setting in 'xwiki.properties', which is directly relevant to enabling notifications. However, irrelevant nodes in the first, second, third, and fifth ranks discuss topics such as the 'Clear All' link, dependencies for the notifications extension, various ways to receive notifications, and the 'What's New' application, which should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.43 because only parts of the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Specifically, the mention of 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' and receiving notifications via the bell icon are supported, but there are no mentions of subscribing to pages or users, following a user, or the 'network' tab in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching users, but lacks details on subscribing to pages, using the alert menu, and viewing the network tab in the user profile."
