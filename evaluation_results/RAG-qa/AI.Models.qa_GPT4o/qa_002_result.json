  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because the response provides some relevant information about the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly address the question, which lowers the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.57 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the first node explaining 'how to follow a user to receive notifications' and the sixth node mentioning 'different ways to be notified in XWiki', are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. However, irrelevant nodes like the second node discussing 'technical filters and settings that do not directly address the issue' and the third node about 'customizing email templates and creating global notification filters' are ranked too closely to relevant nodes, which lowers the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some sentences, like those about the 'alert' menu (sentence 4), following a user (sentence 5), and the 'network' tab (sentence 6), are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, others such as enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` (sentence 2), subscribing to pages or users (sentence 3), and watching a page or wiki (sentence 4) are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions following a user and watching pages, but lacks details on enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or using the alert menu."
