  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, explaining 'how to follow a user to receive notifications,' and is ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. However, the second node discusses 'filters for hidden pages and other technical details,' which do not directly relate to enabling notifications, and should be ranked lower. Additionally, the fifth node, which is relevant and 'provides information about the notifications settings menu,' is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes, such as the third node about 'customizing email templates for notifications,' which does not directly help in resolving the issue.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while the retrieval context nodes support several aspects of the expected output, such as watching pages or users and using the alert menu, they lack information on enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and subscribing to pages or users, which are crucial details in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers enabling notifications via user profile and watching users, but lacks details on setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' and specific steps to watch pages or entire wikis.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output covers some aspects like watching users or pages and enabling notifications but includes many irrelevant points such as email settings, admin settings, and filtering options. It lacks direct instructions on setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true' in 'xwiki.properties' and omits details about using the 'alert' menu."
