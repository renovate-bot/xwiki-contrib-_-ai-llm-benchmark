  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because while the output contains some relevant information, it is diluted by multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the specific question of how to deny script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'methods for checking access rights programmatically' but does not address the specific question. Similarly, the second node explains 'the use of the checkAccess() method' without providing information on denying script rights to a space administrator. The fourth node provides 'details on HTTP methods and status codes for managing attachments and objects in a wiki,' which is unrelated to the question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence cannot be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, which focuses on methods for checking access rights without mentioning the inability to deny rights implied by admin rights.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention that rights implied by admin right cannot be denied."
