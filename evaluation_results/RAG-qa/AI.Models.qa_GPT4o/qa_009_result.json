  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer mostly addresses how to deny script rights to a space administrator, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly claims that denying script rights to space administrators overrides their inherited administrative permissions, while the retrieval context does not support this assertion.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. Each node, from the first to the ninth, discusses various topics such as 'programming rights and their implications', 'lists of rights and their properties', 'tabular view of rights', 'comment, edit, and delete rights', 'script right and its default status', 'code documentation for access checks', 'converting rights and excluding classes and pages', 'checkAccess() method and access violations', and 'potential issues with configurable applications and administration access', but none address the specific issue of denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output, with clear evidence from the nodes in the retrieval context confirming that admin rights cannot be denied. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, aligning closely with the expected output. However, it lacks a direct statement about XWiki not supporting this, slightly reducing completeness."
