  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the output partially addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant statements with source links that do not directly answer the configuration question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.57 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, discussing 'rights inheritance and administration features' pertinent to configuring access control in XWiki. However, the second node is irrelevant, focusing on 'the parent/child relationship and nested spaces', which does not directly relate to setting view and edit permissions for teams. Additionally, the third node is also irrelevant, discussing 'string formatting and OpenID Connect properties', which is unrelated to the input question. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than other relevant nodes, such as the sixth node, which explains 'XWiki's permission system, including setting view and edit rights at different levels', and the eighth node, which provides 'basic rules about setting rights at different levels in XWiki'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the expected output is supported by the nodes in retrieval context, particularly node 6 which aligns with the majority of the steps and outcomes related to access control. However, there is a lack of information regarding the adjustment of rights for additional teams or spaces, which slightly impacts the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights at different levels and inheriting access rights, which aligns with setting wiki-wide and space-level rights in the expected output. However, it lacks specific details about creating groups for each team and setting rights specifically for 'XWikiAllGroup' and team-specific edit rights."
