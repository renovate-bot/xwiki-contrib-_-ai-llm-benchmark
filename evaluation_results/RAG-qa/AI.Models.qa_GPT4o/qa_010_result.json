  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the output partially addresses the input question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in retrieval context, which provides information on XWiki's permission system including setting view and edit rights, is ranked sixth. The first node discusses content organization and rights inheritance in XWiki, which doesn't directly address setting view and edit permissions for teams. The second node is about the parent/child relationship and nested spaces, not directly related to configuring team-specific permissions. The third node discusses string formatting and user properties in OpenID Connect, unrelated to access control in XWiki. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights at different levels and inheritance, but lacks specifics on creating groups for each team, setting wiki-wide rights, and space-level rights as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output accurately describes setting global view permissions and restricting edit permissions to specific spaces, aligning with the expected output. However, it lacks mention of creating groups for each team and inheriting rights for child pages, which are key facts in the expected output."
