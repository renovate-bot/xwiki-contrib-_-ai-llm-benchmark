  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.38 because the provided URLs and information are not directly related to enabling notifications for one's own activity in XWiki, making much of the output irrelevant to the input query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'JWT token generation and its claims', which is unrelated to notifications about user activity. The second node is about 'upgrading wikis and handling invalid extensions', which does not pertain to notifications for user actions. The third node lists 'various XWiki extensions', none of which relate to enabling notifications for a user's own activity. The fourth node is about 'LDAP group mapping and authentication', which is not relevant to the question about enabling notifications for user actions. The fifth node discusses 'form utilization on XWiki.org', which does not address the issue of receiving notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to notification settings or user activity filters."
