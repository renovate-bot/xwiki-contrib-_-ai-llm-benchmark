    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer is mostly relevant to the input question, but it includes several irrelevant URLs that do not address the specific query about configuring file upload restrictions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring file upload restrictions or size limits. For example, the first node describes 'various macros and their functionalities in XWiki', the second node explains 'how to customize the PDF cover in XWiki', and the third node provides 'instructions on creating a new page via a wanted link'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about configuring MIME types or setting maximum upload size for attachments."
