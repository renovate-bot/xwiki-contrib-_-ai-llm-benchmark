  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.72 because the response addresses the main question about configuring access rights in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to answering the question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question about configuring access rights for team spaces in XWiki. For example, the first node provides 'metadata about a specific page in XWiki', which is not relevant, and the second node 'explains how to modify resources using XML and HTTP methods', which is unrelated to setting access permissions. Similarly, the third node 'discusses comment management', which does not pertain to configuring team space access. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than any relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as all key concepts and steps mentioned are not covered in the retrieval context nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to creating groups, defining rights, or inheriting rights, which are the key components of the expected answer."
