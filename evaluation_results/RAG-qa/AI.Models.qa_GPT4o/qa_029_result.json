  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response is mostly relevant to the question about managing script rights for a space administrator. However, it includes source links about internationalization and the XWiki RESTful API, which are not directly related to the question, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second and fourth nodes in the retrieval context are relevant as they discuss 'script rights can be denied' and 'explains script rights, including the ability to deny them', which are pertinent to the question about denying script rights to an administrator. However, the first node, which is about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', and the third node, which is about 'interacting with the XWiki RESTful API', are both irrelevant to the question and should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly supported by the 5th node in the retrieval context, showing a complete match without any discrepancies. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that certain rights like 'programming' and 'admin' are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that admin rights cannot be refused, which is the main point of the expected output."
