  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because the response partially addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but it is lowered by multiple irrelevant source link statements that do not contribute to answering the question directly.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly suggests that script rights are allowed by default at the main wiki level, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that for XWiki 14.10+, script rights are not given by default to all users at the main wiki level.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node is about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', which is unrelated to script rights or administrative permissions, and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node discusses 'interacting with the XWiki RESTful API', which is also unrelated and should be ranked lower. The second node, which is relevant, discusses the 'Script' right and its allowance or denial, and should be ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that certain rights like ADMIN are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that administrator rights cannot be refused, which is the key information in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output provides steps to refuse script rights, whereas expected output states it's not supported in XWiki. No factual consistency and contains extra information."
