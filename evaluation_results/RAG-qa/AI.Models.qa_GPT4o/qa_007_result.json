  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job on providing a focused and accurate response!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first two nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and directly address the process of configuring group synchronization by discussing 'oidc.groups.mapping'. However, the third node, which is ranked higher than it should be, primarily provides links to installation instructions and dependencies, which are not directly related to configuring group synchronization. Additionally, the fourth node focuses on authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints, which are not directly relevant to the task at hand. These irrelevant nodes being ranked higher than the last relevant node discussing 'oidc.groups.claim' slightly lowered the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only a few specific details, such as 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', mentioned in nodes 1 and 7 in the retrieval context, align with the expected output. However, many general instructions and example codes in the expected output are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about configuring 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', which are key elements in the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions about locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file and restarting the XWiki instance."
