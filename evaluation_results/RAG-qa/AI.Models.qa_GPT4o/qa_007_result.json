  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because relevant nodes discussing the `oidc.groups.mapping` and `oidc.groups.claim` properties, crucial for configuring group synchronization, are ranked higher. However, the score is not higher because nodes in retrieval context ranked third, fourth, and fifth provide general information about OpenID Connect, authentication management, and dependencies, which are not directly relevant to the group synchronization process.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while there are supportive nodes in the retrieval context for configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, key procedural steps such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, and saving and restarting XWiki are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes details on configuring `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, which align with the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes configuring `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.mapping`, and `oidc.groups.separator`, aligning with expected output. However, it adds extra steps like enabling group synchronization and handling group restrictions, which are not mentioned in the expected output. The step about saving and restarting XWiki is missing."
