  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the issue of not receiving notifications without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Follow a user' and 'Watched Entities,' is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'getting a notification RSS feed and settings for notifications' and the second node about 'overriding default notification templates and installation instructions,' should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to true and specific steps for following pages or users."
