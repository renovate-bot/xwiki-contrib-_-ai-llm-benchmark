  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.57 because the output contains several irrelevant links that do not directly address configuring access rights in XWiki, which is the main focus of the input. However, the score is not lower because there is some relevant information related to access rights configuration.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, like the third node which 'mentions administrating wiki features like users, groups, and rights, which is directly relevant to configuring access controls for teams,' and the sixth node which 'provides a link to managing users and groups, which is relevant for setting up team-specific access controls in XWiki,' are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node 'discusses XWiki's database support and efficiency, which is not relevant to configuring access controls for teams,' and the second node 'is about displaying notifications and does not relate to access control configurations in XWiki,' both of which are ranked higher than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.38 because only some aspects of the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Specifically, sentence 1 is supported by node 5 regarding managing groups, sentence 2 is supported by node 3 about administrating rights, and sentence 4 is supported by node 5 regarding nested pages. However, sentences 3, 5, 6, 7, and the introductory and reminder sentences do not have direct matches in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information on creating groups, setting wiki-wide and area-specific rights, and inheriting rights for subpages, which are key elements in the expected answer."
