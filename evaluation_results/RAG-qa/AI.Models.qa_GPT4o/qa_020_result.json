  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because the response partially addresses the question about configuring user permissions in XWiki, but it is lowered due to multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the task at hand.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database support and efficiency', which is unrelated to configuring access controls for teams. The second node is about notifications, which does not relate to access control or team permissions in XWiki. The third node covers administrating wiki features but lacks specific steps for configuring team access as required by the input. Subsequent nodes similarly fail to address the specific access control configuration needed for teams in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.22 because only a few sentences in the expected output, such as sentence 1 and 2, are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specifically nodes 6 and 3. However, many other sentences, including sentence 3, 4, and the concluding statements, lack direct support from any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about creating groups, setting rights, or managing access control in XWiki, which are all key components of the expected answer.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output aligns well with the expected output by covering global permissions, area-specific permissions, and group management. However, it lacks specific instructions for setting 'View' rights for 'XWikiAllGroup' and does not mention inheriting rights for child pages."
