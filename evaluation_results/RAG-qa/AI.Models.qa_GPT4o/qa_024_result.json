  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant, addressing the question about disabling notifications. However, it includes links and references that do not directly address the specific issue, slightly reducing its relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. Each node fails to address 'disabling automatic notifications or managing auto-watched pages'. For instance, the first node discusses 'various notification filters and settings' without mentioning how to disable automatic notifications, and the second node lists 'different notification preferences and macros' but lacks information on managing auto-watched pages. As a result, the irrelevant nodes are not ranked lower than any relevant nodes, leading to a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while nodes in the retrieval context cover aspects like default notification settings and custom filters (relating to sentences 1, 3, and 4 of the expected output), they do not explicitly mention being notified of changes to one's work, which affects sentence 2.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions auto-watched pages and notification settings but lacks details on modifying 'Suivi automatique des pages' and removing filters from 'Filtres personnalis\u00e9s'.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output discusses settings for notifications but misses key details from the expected output about automatic page watching and modifying notification filters."
