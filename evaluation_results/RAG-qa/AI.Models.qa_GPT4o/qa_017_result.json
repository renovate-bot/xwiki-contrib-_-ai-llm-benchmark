  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node focuses on general OpenID Connect provider configuration and endpoints, which does not address group synchronization setup. The second node discusses container authentication and other methods, lacking details on configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The third node is about domain-based instance authentication and session cookies, unrelated to group synchronization setup. The fourth node provides a general description of OpenID Connect authentication and mentions automatic synchronization, but lacks specific instructions for group synchronization setup. The fifth node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension, which is not relevant to setting up group synchronization. The sixth node mentions group synchronization but does not provide detailed instructions or configuration steps necessary for the expected output. The seventh node provides a brief mention of group synchronization using a claim, but lacks detailed configuration steps or examples needed for the expected output.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only a few aspects of the expected output, such as setting properties in `xwiki.properties` and defining group mappings using `oidc.groups.mapping`, are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Most instructions, like locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, configuring specific properties, and restarting the XWiki instance, are not covered in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks specific details about configuring group synchronization properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' in the 'xwiki.properties' file, which are essential in the expected output."
