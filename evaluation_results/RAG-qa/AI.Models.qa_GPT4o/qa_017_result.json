  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the output mostly addresses the process of setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes some statements that are not directly relevant to the setup process, which prevents the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.21 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, specifically the sixth and eighth nodes, discuss 'Group synchronization' and the 'oidc.groups.mapping' property, which are directly relevant to the input. However, the first five nodes, which are ranked higher, are irrelevant as they discuss topics like 'authentication management and endpoints', 'container authentication', 'domain-based authentication', 'general information about OpenID Connect', and 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', none of which mention group synchronization. This misranking of irrelevant nodes above relevant ones results in a lower score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the 6th node in the retrieval context supports the general concept of group synchronization and configuring properties in 'xwiki.properties', it lacks specific details and examples provided in the expected output, such as opening the file with a text editor, using specific property values, and saving the file.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks specific details about configuring group synchronization properties such as `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual Output omits steps regarding `oidc.groups.claim` and separator configuration, deviating from Expected Output. It includes group mapping but lacks detail on saving `xwiki.properties` and restarting XWiki. Adds context on custom synchronization and error checking, which aligns with expected context but lacks direct factual accuracy."
