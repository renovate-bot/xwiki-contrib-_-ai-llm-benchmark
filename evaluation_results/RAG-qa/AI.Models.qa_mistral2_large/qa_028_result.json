    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer partially addresses the question but includes multiple irrelevant URLs and general statements that do not provide specific steps for configuring file upload restrictions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are unrelated to the input. For example, the first node is about 'various macros and functionalities in XWiki', which does not pertain to configuring file upload restrictions. Similarly, the second node discusses 'customizing the PDF cover in XWiki', which is also irrelevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention any of the steps or details provided in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about configuring MIME types or setting the maximum attachment size."
