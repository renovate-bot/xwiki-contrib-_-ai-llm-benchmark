  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer mostly addresses the configuration question in XWiki, but it includes multiple source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem, which slightly detracts from its relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.21 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, which provide information on XWiki's permission system and basic rules for setting rights, are ranked lower (sixth and eighth) than several irrelevant nodes. These irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing the organization of content and the second node focusing on parent/child relationships, do not address access control or rights management and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context (node 6) supports the general idea of setting wiki-wide and page-level rights (related to sentences 2, 3, and 4), it lacks specific details about creating groups for each team (sentence 1) and ensuring all teams can view all spaces and only edit their own space (concluding sentences).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights at different levels and inheritance of access rights, which partially aligns with setting wiki-wide and space-level rights. However, it lacks specific details on creating groups for each team and setting 'Edit' rights for team-specific spaces as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output aligns with the expected output in terms of global view rights and specific edit rights for each team. However, it lacks creating groups for each team and setting wiki-wide rights for XWikiAllGroup. It includes denying edit rights for other teams, which is not mentioned in the expected output."
