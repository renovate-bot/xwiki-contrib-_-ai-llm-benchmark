  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Group synchronization' and provides a link to more detailed instructions, is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node that primarily provides links to prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies, the second node that describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension and its installation details, and the third node that discusses container authentication and other methods like Active Directory and LDAP, are ranked higher. Additionally, the fifth node lists general configuration guides and files but does not address group synchronization specifically.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.77 because while the retrieval context covers the configuration of group synchronization properties in detail, it lacks explicit mentions of locating, opening, and saving the `xwiki.properties` file, as well as restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization but lacks detailed steps and specific properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` found in the expected output."
