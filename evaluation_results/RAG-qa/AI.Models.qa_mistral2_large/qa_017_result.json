  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.21 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'general OpenID Connect configuration and endpoints' without addressing group synchronization, and the second node provides 'information about different authentication methods and extensions' without mentioning group synchronization. These should be ranked lower than the sixth node, which mentions 'Group synchronization' and provides details about using claims and mapping properties in the xwiki.properties file. Additionally, the eighth node also discusses 'Group synchronization' and should be ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.30 because while the retrieval context nodes mention properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, they do not cover the broader steps required for setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, or saving changes and restarting XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and the oidc.groups.mapping property, but lacks details on configuring xwiki.properties, setting oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, and restarting XWiki.",
    "Correctness": "Key facts such as editing `xwiki.properties` and restarting XWiki are present. However, discrepancies include the use of `oidc.userinfoclaims` instead of `oidc.groups.claim`, and lack of details on `oidc.groups.separator`. Additional information like implementing a listener is also present, which contradicts the expected output."
