  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and effectively addresses the question about disabling notifications in XWiki. The only minor issue is the inclusion of a source link, which doesn't directly answer the question but doesn't significantly detract from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.34 because the first three nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, discussing topics like 'following a user and receiving notifications about events triggered by that user', 'selecting the level of detail in email notifications', and 'enabling and disabling the email feature', which do not address how to disable notifications for pages. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than relevant nodes that discuss 'administrators changing users' notification settings', 'default settings for notifications', and 'filters for notifications', which are pertinent to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only the information about default auto watching page behavior is supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specifically node 5. However, details about being notified of changes and deleting notification filters in the 'Custom Filters' list are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings but lacks details on automatic page watching and deleting notification filters."
