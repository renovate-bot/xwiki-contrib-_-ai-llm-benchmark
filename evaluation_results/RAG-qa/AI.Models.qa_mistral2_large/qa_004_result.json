  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about disabling notifications in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.37 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the third node mentioning 'Watch and custom filters' and 'Enabling notifications for all users by default,' and the fifth node discussing 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode,' are ranked lower than some irrelevant nodes. Irrelevant nodes like the first node, which talks about enabling/disabling the notification module and email notifications, and the second node, which discusses RSS feeds and general notification settings, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only the first sentence in the expected output is somewhat supported by the 4th node in the retrieval context, while the rest of the sentences are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions automatic notifications for actions performed by users and settings for notifications, but lacks details about major modifications, custom filters, and user profile settings."
