    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in retrieval context (rank 4) that mentions the 'xwiki.properties' configuration file is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension but does not address the specific configuration needed. The second node lists various sections and guides without providing the required configuration. The third node mentions other authentication methods but not the specific configuration for automatic activation of user accounts.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context mentions 'xwiki.properties', it lacks details on adding or updating properties, the specific property `oidc.enableUser`, steps to save the file and restart XWiki, and the automatic activation of new user accounts upon first login via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
