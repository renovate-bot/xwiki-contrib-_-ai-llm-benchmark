  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes source links that do not directly address the problem, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'image links and references' which are 'not related to notifications or their settings.' Similarly, the second node also focuses on 'image links and references' that 'do not provide any information about enabling notifications.' The third and fourth nodes continue with 'image links and references,' which are 'unrelated to the topic of notifications.' Finally, the fifth node talks about 'permissions and a security module,' which is 'not relevant to enabling or managing notifications.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to enabling notifications or following pages/users as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not address enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` or following pages/users as outlined in the expected output. It instead provides generic troubleshooting steps unrelated to the specific instructions given in the expected output."
