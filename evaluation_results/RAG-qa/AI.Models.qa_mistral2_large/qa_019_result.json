    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer is mostly relevant to the input question, but the repeated URL provided does not directly address the specific query about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'images and links related to various projects', the second node discusses 'authentication methods and configurations', and the third node is about 'mail templates used for password reset and username recovery'. None of these contexts address the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to the admin rights or their limitations in XWiki as mentioned in the expected output."
