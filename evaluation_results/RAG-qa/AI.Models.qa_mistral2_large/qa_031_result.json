  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the main content addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but the inclusion of multiple source links that do not directly contribute to the answer reduces the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'LDAP configuration and authentication', which is unrelated to token-based authentication, yet it is ranked higher than the second node that provides information on configuring 'Authorized Applications', which is relevant to using JWTs for authentication. Similarly, the third node is about 'LDAP authentication', which is not relevant, but it appears before the fourth node that details 'requirements for JWT token generation', directly relevant to the input. These misplacements contribute to the score not being higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains detailed information about configuring authorized applications, JWT token generation, and claims required, matching the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit mention of the limitation regarding existing users not created through the authenticator."
