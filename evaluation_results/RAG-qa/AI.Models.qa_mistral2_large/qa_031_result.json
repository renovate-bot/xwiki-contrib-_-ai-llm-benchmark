  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the main content of the output addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but the inclusion of multiple irrelevant source links prevents the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the second node discussing 'the configuration of authorized applications' and the fourth node detailing 'JWT token requirements and signing process', are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node, which is about 'LDAP configuration and does not mention token-based authentication or JWT', is ranked higher than these relevant nodes. This misordering affects the precision score, as irrelevant nodes are not ranked lower than relevant ones.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the necessary information from the expected answer, including the use of JWT tokens with specific claims, Ed25519 key signing, configuration steps in 'xwiki.properties', and limitations on user creation and updates.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator, which differs from the expected output's Token-based authentication for the LLM Application extension, including different setup details and token requirements."
