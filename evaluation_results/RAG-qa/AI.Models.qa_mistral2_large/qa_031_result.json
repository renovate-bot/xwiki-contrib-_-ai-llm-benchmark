  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and directly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the default response type can be 'id_token' or a combination like 'code,id_token', whereas the retrieval context states that the default response type is 'code' only.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the first node discusses claims at the UserInfo endpoint, which is not relevant to authenticating users with access tokens, and should be ranked lower. The second node is correctly ranked as it provides information about configuring 'Authorized Applications,' which is directly relevant. However, other irrelevant nodes discussing security modules, cookie protection, and user profile rights are ranked higher than they should be.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because only the sentence about configuring authorized applications (sentence 2) can be linked to the 2nd node in the retrieval context, while the rest of the sentences in the expected output are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions authorized applications and some security settings, but lacks detailed information on JWT claims, token generation, and specific configuration steps."
