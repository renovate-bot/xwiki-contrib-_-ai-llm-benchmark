  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly answer the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states, 'By default, you won\u2019t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is correctly ranked first. This directly addresses the input question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. Great job on getting it right!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the 1st sentence in the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the 2nd sentence lacks support as the retrieval context does not mention 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' or related settings.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the option to change this setting. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section for disabling the filter."
