  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response is mostly relevant and helpful in addressing how to enable notifications for one's own actions. However, it includes an irrelevant link to XWiki syntax documentation, which slightly detracts from the focus of the answer.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states, 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is ranked first, perfectly addressing the input question about not receiving notifications for one's own activity and how to change this setting. The irrelevant nodes, which discuss topics like general notification settings, RSS feeds, and unrelated notification preferences, are all ranked lower, ensuring precise and relevant information is prioritized.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the first sentence is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, the information about disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' is not found in any of the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the ability to change this setting by switching off the 'Own event filter'. However, it does not explicitly mention 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' as the section to change this setting, which slightly reduces the completeness.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly states that users do not receive notifications for their own actions by default, aligning with the expected output. However, it lacks mentioning that notifications are received if the event explicitly targets the user, and it provides additional information on how to change the settings, which is not in the expected output."
