  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about disabling notifications, but it includes URLs that are not directly related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first two nodes discuss 'getting a notification RSS feed and the Notifications Macro' and 'various notification preferences macros', which are unrelated to disabling notifications, and should be ranked lower than the third node, which mentions 'Auto Watch' and 'Default Watch Settings' relevant to managing automatically enabled notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the retrieval context supports the automatic addition of pages to the watch list (sentence 1 and 2) and the ability to modify notification settings (sentence 3), but it does not mention deleting existing notification filters (sentence 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions auto-watching pages and modifying notification settings, but lacks details on removing custom filters."
