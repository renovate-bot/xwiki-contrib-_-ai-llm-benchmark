  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the input without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node, which 'describes how to set limits on the maximum size of an attachment and mentions the configuration steps', is ranked fifth. This means that many irrelevant nodes, such as the first node which 'discusses linking to external files and images, but does not address configuring upload restrictions or size limits', are ranked higher than the relevant node. These irrelevant nodes, including the second node that 'explains the structure of XWiki pages and available actions, but does not mention attachment upload restrictions or size limits', should be ranked lower to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.64 because while several sentences in the expected output align well with nodes in the retrieval context, particularly steps for configuring mimetypes and maximum attachment size (nodes 4 and 5), introductory and explanatory sentences lack direct matches in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions, but lacks specific instructions for configuring mimetypes in xwiki.properties and setting the size to 10MB as detailed in the expected output."
