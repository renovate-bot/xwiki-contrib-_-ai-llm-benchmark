  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims you can change the default setting by switching off the 'Own event filter' in the notification settings, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the fourth rank mentions the setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties', which directly addresses the need to ensure notifications are enabled. However, the irrelevant nodes ranked higher discuss topics like 'visual representation and grouping of notifications' (first node), 'dependencies for the notifications extension' (second node), and 'various ways to receive notifications without specific steps to enable or troubleshoot them' (third node), which do not help in resolving the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.29 because only the information about enabling notifications in xwiki.properties is supported by the retrieval context, while the rest of the details about subscribing to pages or users, watching pages or users, and the 'alert' menu are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and the alert menu but lacks details on subscribing to pages or users and viewing watched users in the network tab."
