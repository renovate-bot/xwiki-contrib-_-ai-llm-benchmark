  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that new users do not receive notifications until they start watching something and enable specific application types, whereas the context clarifies that the whole wiki is watched by default for new users in versions before 15.5, with certain application types like Mention enabled.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which explains 'how to follow a user to receive notifications about their activities', is ranked first. This ensures that the most pertinent information is prioritized, providing an excellent retrieval result!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some sentences, like those about using the 'alert' menu (supported by node 6 in the retrieval context) and following a user (supported by node 1 in the retrieval context), are well-supported, critical details about enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties' and subscribing to pages are missing in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions following users and watching pages, which aligns with the expected output. However, it lacks details on enabling notifications via xwiki.properties and using the alert menu.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides reasons for not receiving notifications but misses key details like enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and subscribing to specific pages or users as mentioned in the expected output."
