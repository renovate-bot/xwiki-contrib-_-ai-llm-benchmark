  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response largely addresses the issue of the notification bell not being available, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to resolving the specific problem mentioned.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters' but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The second node lists 'various ways to receive notifications' but does not provide information on enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The third node describes 'different notification preferences macros' but does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The fourth node provides 'links to various notification-related settings' but does not discuss enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The fifth node describes 'the notifications menu and its features' but does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The sixth node provides 'links to various notification settings' but does not discuss enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The seventh node discusses 'administrator settings for notifications' but does not specifically mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The eighth node discusses 'email notifications and their configuration' but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only the instruction to edit `xwiki.properties` is supported by the 6th node in the retrieval context, while the specific mention of enabling notifications is not found in any node.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, which is the key information in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output lacks the specific configuration detail of setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties` as mentioned in the expected output."
