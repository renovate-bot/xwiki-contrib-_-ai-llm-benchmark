    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses how to get a notification RSS feed and the settings for notifications, but it does not address enabling notifications in the wiki or the specific setting `notifications.enabled`. Similarly, the second node provides information on overriding default notification templates and installation instructions, but it does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki or the `notifications.enabled` setting.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` or provide any information about setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`."
