  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.39 because the output contains numerous code import statements and implementation details that do not directly address the process of configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. These irrelevant elements significantly lower the relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides information on group synchronization, is ranked fourth. The first three nodes are irrelevant as they discuss 'authentication management and endpoints', 'container authentication', and 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', which do not address group synchronization or OpenID Connect group claims. This lowers the score as the relevant information is not prioritized.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.44 because while the 4th node in retrieval context supports the configuration of 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' as mentioned in sentences 3, 5, and 7 of the expected output, it lacks information on locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, providing examples, and saving changes as required in sentences 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks details on oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator configuration steps."
