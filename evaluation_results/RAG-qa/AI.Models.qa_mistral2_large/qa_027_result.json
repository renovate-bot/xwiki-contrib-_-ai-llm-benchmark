  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes a link to a general guide on creating new users in XWiki, which is not directly related to configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node in rank 2, which mentions the default group synchronization and relevant properties in the `xwiki.properties` file, is correctly identified. However, irrelevant nodes in ranks 1, 3, 4, and 5, which discuss prerequisites, customization templates, unrelated endpoints, and general user management, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.54 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring properties like oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, and oidc.groups.mapping (supporting sentences 3, 5, and 7 of the expected output), it lacks explicit instructions for opening the xwiki.properties file with a text editor, replacing placeholders with actual values, and saving/restarting XWiki (unsupporting sentences 2, 4, 6, and 8).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and the use of the xwiki.properties file, but lacks detailed steps on configuring specific properties like oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, and oidc.groups.mapping."
