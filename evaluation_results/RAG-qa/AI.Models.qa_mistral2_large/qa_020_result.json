  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the output provides relevant information about configuring team access in XWiki, but it includes several irrelevant source links that do not directly address the specific configuration question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses XWiki's database efficiency and programming features, which are not relevant to configuring access controls for teams. The second node is about the Notifications Application in XWiki, which does not relate to setting access rights for teams. The third node describes an application for administrating wiki features but does not provide specific guidance on configuring access controls for teams. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than any relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about creating groups, setting rights, and inheriting rights, which are key elements in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output covers key facts like hierarchical structure and team-specific editing rights. However, it misses 'wikiweiten Rechten' and 'Vererben von Rechten' from expected output, and introduces '\u00dcberpr\u00fcfung und Anpassung' which is not in the expected output."
