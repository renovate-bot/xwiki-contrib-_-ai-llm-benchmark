  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response partially addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the specific task of setting permissions for team areas.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database efficiency and compatibility', which does not relate to configuring access controls for teams. The second node is about 'notifications and application details', not about configuring team access or editing rights in XWiki. The third node describes 'an administration application for managing wiki features', but lacks guidance on configuring team access rights. Subsequent nodes continue to be unrelated, discussing topics like 'Admin UI for Model Validation', 'Nested Pages and subwikis', 'managing users and groups', 'LDAP group configurations', 'group synchronization and customization options', and 'LDAP group mapping and Java code for authentication', none of which address the specific requirement of setting view and edit rights for different teams in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context, indicating a complete lack of relevant information.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any relevant information about creating groups, setting rights, or access control in XWiki as outlined in the expected output."
