  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it slightly deviates by mentioning LDAP Authenticator, which is unrelated to the user's query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which contains the property '# oidc.enableUser=true', is ranked first. This directly addresses the need to enable user accounts on first login, ensuring that all irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing 'domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration' (second node), 'resetting passwords and different authentication mechanisms' (third node), and others, are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the nodes in the retrieval context support the instructions to enable user accounts by setting the `oidc.enableUser` property, they do not mention the need to save the file and restart XWiki, nor do they explain the outcome of enabling new user accounts.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the exact information found in the expected answer, specifically the property '# oidc.enableUser=true' in the 'xwiki.properties' file, which needs to be uncommented and set to 'true' to enable user accounts on first login via OpenID Connect.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly describes setting the oidc.enableUser property to true in the xwiki.properties file and restarting XWiki. However, it lacks guidance on uncommenting the line and uses a different format for adding the property. It does not mention the comments about enabling user accounts, which are present in the expected output."
