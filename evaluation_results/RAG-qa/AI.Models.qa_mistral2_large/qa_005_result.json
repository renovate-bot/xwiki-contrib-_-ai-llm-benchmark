  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes a mention of LDAP Authenticator, which is unrelated to the question, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the first node in the retrieval context is directly relevant, mentioning the '# oidc.enableUser=true' property, which is precisely about enabling user accounts on first login. All irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing 'domain-based authentication and session cookies' (second node), 'password reset and various authentication mechanisms' (third node), and others, are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context supports the need to adjust the `xwiki.properties` file and set the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true`, it lacks information about saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, and confirming that new user accounts are automatically enabled upon first login via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes the exact information about the 'oidc.enableUser' property being set to true and needing to be uncommented, which matches the expected output."
