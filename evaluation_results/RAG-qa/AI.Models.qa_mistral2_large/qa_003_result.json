  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response partially addresses how to enable notifications for one's own actions in XWiki, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, which explain how to enable notifications for one's own actions by mentioning options like 'Advanced filtering options' and 'Own event filter', are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The irrelevant nodes discuss topics such as following a user, administrator settings, and RSS feeds, which do not pertain to the input query. Great job on getting it just right!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context fully includes the expected answer's information about not receiving notifications for one's own activity by default and the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the notification settings in the user profile.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output aligns with the expected output by correctly stating the default notification setting and the ability to disable the filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' of the notification settings in the user profile."
