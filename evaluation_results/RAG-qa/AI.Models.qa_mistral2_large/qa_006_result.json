    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.62 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant as it mentions 'oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}', which directly relates to mapping additional user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. However, irrelevant nodes discussing 'access tokens and scopes' (second node), 'group synchronization and custom claims' (third node), 'authentication management class and OpenID Connect provider endpoints' (fourth node), and other unrelated topics are ranked higher than the second relevant node, which lists 'available variables such as oidc.user.subject' (eighth node). These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the information in the 1st node in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains detailed information about customizing user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, matching the expected output."
