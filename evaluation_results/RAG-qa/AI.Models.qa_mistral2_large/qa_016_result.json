  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response is mostly relevant to the input question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki. However, it includes source links that do not directly address the customization process, which slightly reduces the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. For example, the first node discusses 'container authentication and Active Directory', which are unrelated to 'customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider'. Similarly, the second node is about 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', which does not relate to 'mapping user profile fields in XWiki'. None of the nodes address the specific need to customize or map user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because only some parts of the expected output, specifically sentence 1 and part of sentence 2, can be linked to the 7th node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'xwiki.properties' and 'oidc.user.mapping'. However, the specific examples and instructions in sentences 3 and 4 are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions OpenID Connect and xwiki.properties but lacks details on customizing user profile fields or using oidc.user.mapping as described in the expected output."
