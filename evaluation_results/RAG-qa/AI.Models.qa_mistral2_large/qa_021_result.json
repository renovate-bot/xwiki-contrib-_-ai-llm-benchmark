  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant, addressing the main issue about the notification bell. However, it includes a minor irrelevant detail about XWiki syntax, which slightly affects the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which includes a section on enabling notifications by setting 'notifications.enabled = true' in xwiki.properties, is ranked fourth. This node directly relates to the input, but it is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses custom notification filters and their behavior, which does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The second node lists various notification preferences and macros, which also does not mention enabling notifications. The third node talks about filtering notifications and hidden pages, which is unrelated to enabling notifications. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, specifically node 4, which provides all the necessary details about enabling notifications in the wiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context explicitly mentions enabling notifications by setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' to 'true', which directly matches the expected output."
