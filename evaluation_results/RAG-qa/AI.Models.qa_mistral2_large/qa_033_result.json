  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because while the answer partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, it includes multiple irrelevant URLs and a general summary that does not add new information.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.85 because the actual output incorrectly claims the ability to define the scope 'offline_access', which is not mentioned in the retrieval context, and it also misrepresents the handling of permissions by stating that rights are implicitly denied at the same level, contrary to the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'properties and operations related to a collection resource,' which is unrelated to user authentication with access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to authenticating users with access tokens or JWT, nor does it mention the specific steps outlined in the expected answer."
