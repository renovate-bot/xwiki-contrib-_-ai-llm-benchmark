  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information on configuring XWiki, but it includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access controls for team spaces in XWiki. For example, the first node discusses the creation of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki but does not address access controls, and the second node is about macros and HTML syntax, which is unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, defining rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages as mentioned in the expected output."
