  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the main content addresses how to refuse script rights to a space administrator, but multiple irrelevant source links are included, which do not contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node is about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki,' which is unrelated to the question about script rights. Similarly, the third node discusses 'interacting with the XWiki RESTful API,' which is also irrelevant. However, the second node correctly addresses 'programming and script rights,' making it relevant to the input question, which is why the score is not lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that admin rights imply other rights and are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that admin rights cannot be refused as in the expected output."
