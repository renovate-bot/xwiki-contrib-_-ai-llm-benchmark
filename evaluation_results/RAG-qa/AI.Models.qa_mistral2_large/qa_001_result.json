  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the response mostly addresses the issue of the missing 'Bell' icon in XWiki, but the inclusion of multiple source links that do not directly address the problem slightly reduces its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output suggests navigating to the Administration page and selecting the Import category to upload the XAR file for the Notifications Application, which is not specified in the retrieval context as the method for installing the Notifications Application.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.31 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the third node which 'mentions various notification methods in XWiki, including the Notifications Application,' and the seventh node which 'discusses how administrators can configure notification settings, including enabling notifications by default,' are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node 'discusses installation instructions and prerequisites for extensions,' which is not relevant to enabling notifications, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 7th node in the retrieval context relates to enabling notifications, there is no mention of the specific setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties'.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or the `notifications.enabled` setting."
