  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about the bell icon in XWiki, but it includes repeated irrelevant statements about a source link that do not directly address the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output incorrectly suggests that manual installation of the Notifications Application is possible when the Extension Manager is not functioning, contradicting the retrieval context which states that offline installation of extensions in XWiki is not supported.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.31 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the third node, which 'mentions various ways to receive notifications in XWiki and references the Notifications Application,' is relevant but ranked after nodes discussing 'installation instructions and prerequisites' (first node) and 'access issues and error messages related to configurable applications' (second node), which are not relevant to the issue of the bell icon not appearing. Additionally, the seventh node, which 'provides information on configuring notification settings in the administration,' is relevant but ranked after nodes that describe 'the content and behavior of the Alert menu' (fourth node) and list 'dependencies for a specific extension' (fifth node), which do not address the issue.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the `notifications.enabled` setting or `xwiki.properties` file, which are crucial for enabling notifications as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention enabling notifications in xwiki.properties, which is the key instruction in the expected output."
