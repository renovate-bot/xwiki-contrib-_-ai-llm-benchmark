  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about configuring attachment settings in XWiki, but it includes links to unrelated extensions and user guides.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.71 because the actual output incorrectly states that the maximum size for attachments is 10 MB, while the retrieval context indicates that it is 100GB by default and 32MB for XWiki versions less than 10.9RC1.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes, ensuring the most pertinent information is prioritized.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while the retrieval context provides relevant information about editing `xwiki.properties` and configuring MIME types (2nd node), as well as steps to change the maximum attachment size (1st node), it lacks specific details such as the exact line for MIME type configuration and a comprehensive step-by-step guide for setting the maximum attachment size.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes steps to configure maximum attachment size and mentions MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details on configuring MIME types in `xwiki.properties` and setting the size to 10 MB."
