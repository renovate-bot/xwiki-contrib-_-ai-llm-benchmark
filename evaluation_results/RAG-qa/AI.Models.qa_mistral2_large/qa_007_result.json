  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the relevant nodes discussing 'oidc.groups.mapping', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.claim' are ranked higher, providing pertinent details for configuring group synchronization. However, the third node primarily discusses authentication and general OpenID Connect setup, which is not specifically about group synchronization, and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the fourth node focuses on authentication management and endpoint configuration, and the fifth node lists dependencies, both of which are not directly related to the group synchronization setup needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.46 because while some nodes in the retrieval context support configuring properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', key actions such as locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, replacing placeholders, and restarting the XWiki instance are not covered by the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about configuring `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, but lacks explicit steps for locating and editing `xwiki.properties` and restarting XWiki."
