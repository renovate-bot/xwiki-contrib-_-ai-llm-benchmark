  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the configuration of XWiki for automatic user account activation using OpenID Connect. However, it includes some irrelevant statements such as a link to the XWiki RESTful API documentation and a configuration line that does not provide useful context.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts. Similarly, the second node discusses other authentication methods like Active Directory and LDAP, which are not relevant to the specific configuration required for OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or setting the `oidc.enableUser` property."
