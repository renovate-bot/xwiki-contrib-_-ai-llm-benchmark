  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the main content is relevant and addresses the input question, but the inclusion of headings like 'Gruppensynchronisation:', 'Anpassung:', and 'Fehlerbehebung:' detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics such as 'group synchronization, templates, and event listeners' (first node), 'protection levels for cookies, IP address usage, and security strategies for failed logins' (second node), 'LDAP group mapping and SSO implementation using Kerberos' (third node), 'mail templates for password reset and username retrieval' (fourth node), and 'custom claims for OpenID Connect and group synchronization' (fifth node), which are not relevant to the question about access token-based user authentication.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication or the LLM-Anwendung (BETA)-Erweiterung."
