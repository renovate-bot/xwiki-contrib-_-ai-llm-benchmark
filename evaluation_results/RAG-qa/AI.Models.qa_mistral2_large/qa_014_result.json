  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the answer partially addresses the question about disabling notifications, but the repeated irrelevant link significantly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'XWiki Syntax and formatting,' which does not relate to disabling notifications. Similarly, the second node discusses 'LLM Application and JWT authentication,' which is also unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic page following, notification settings, or custom filters as mentioned in the expected output."
