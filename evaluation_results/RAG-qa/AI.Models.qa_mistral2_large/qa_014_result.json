  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the answer partially addresses how to disable notifications, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the question, which lowers the relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'attaching files and does not relate to notification settings or disabling notifications', which should be ranked lower. Similarly, the second node discusses 'moving attachments, which is unrelated to notification settings', and should also be ranked lower. This pattern continues with all nodes, such as the third node providing 'a list of macros and their uses, which is not relevant to notification settings', indicating that the relevant nodes are not ranked higher than irrelevant ones.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic page following or notification settings as mentioned in the expected output."
