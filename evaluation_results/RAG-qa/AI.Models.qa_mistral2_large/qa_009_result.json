  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'programming rights and script execution but does not address denying script rights to a space administrator.' Similarly, the second node 'lists various rights and their default states, but it does not mention the inability to deny rights implied by admin rights.' The third node provides 'a tabular view of rights but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator.' These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than any relevant nodes, resulting in a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, aligning with the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output suggests denying script rights at the space level, contradicting the expected output that implies rights implied by admin rights cannot be denied in XWiki."
