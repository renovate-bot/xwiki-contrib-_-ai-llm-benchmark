  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly address the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. The first node discusses 'programming rights and the implications of admin rights' but does not address denying script rights specifically. The second node provides 'a list of rights and their default states' but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator. Subsequent nodes similarly fail to address the specific issue of denying script rights to a space administrator, focusing instead on unrelated topics such as 'comment, edit, and delete rights' and 'rights conversion and excluded spaces.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, aligning with the expected answer that admin rights cannot be denied in XWiki."
