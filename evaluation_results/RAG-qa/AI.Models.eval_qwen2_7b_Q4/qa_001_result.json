  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the provided URLs are not directly relevant to the issue of the missing bell icon in the notifications system, but the rest of the response is highly relevant and helpful.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses various applications and features in XWiki without addressing enabling notifications. The second node talks about a 'What's New' application for news notifications but lacks information on enabling notifications in XWiki. The third node lists notification-related macros and preferences but does not mention how to enable notifications in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context nodes mention notifications and getting notified about events, they do not specify the exact setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the availability of the 'Bell' icon or the 'Alert Notification' extension specifically.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, such as the Menu application, the Invitation application, the What's New Application, and various notification preferences and macros. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
