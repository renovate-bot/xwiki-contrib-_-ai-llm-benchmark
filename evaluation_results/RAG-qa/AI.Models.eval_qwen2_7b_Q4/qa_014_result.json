  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the answer partially addresses how to disable notifications, but includes irrelevant URLs and an unnecessary apology, which do not directly help in solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'the configuration of blocked attachment mimetypes,' the second node is about 'setting the default language for a wiki page,' and the third node covers 'directory cleanup and database attachment storage.' None of these contexts relate to notification settings or how to disable them.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provided discusses blocked attachment mimetypes, default language settings, and directory cleanup, which are all irrelevant to the input about disabling notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key aspects such as defining blocked attachment mimetypes, setting the default language for a page, and directory cleanup related to the Filesystem Attachment Store and the Database Attachment Store, which are all crucial elements expected in the context."
