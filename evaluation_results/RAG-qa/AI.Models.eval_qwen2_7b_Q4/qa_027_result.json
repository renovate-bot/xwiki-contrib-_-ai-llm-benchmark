  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes an irrelevant URL about scalability and performance, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering, which are not relevant to configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The second node is about authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration, which does not address the process of configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The third node mentions OpenID Connect and some configuration guides, but does not provide specific instructions on configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering features, which are irrelevant to the input question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output omits critical information about XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering capabilities, domain-based instance authentication, and session cookie configuration, despite correctly discussing the installation and configuration of the OpenID Connect extension."
