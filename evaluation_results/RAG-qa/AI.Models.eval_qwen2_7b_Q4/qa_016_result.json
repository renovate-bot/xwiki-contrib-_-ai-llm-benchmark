  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the main answer addresses the customization of user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki, but several irrelevant statements about session cookie domains and scalability documentation detract from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly suggests that the session cookie configuration fix will work for XWiki instances with very different domains and that the OIDC authenticator relies on the property xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains in xwiki.cfg.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics unrelated to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider. For instance, the first node discusses 'authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration', the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator', and the third node discusses 'XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but does not address customizing user profile fields or mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output contains no factual alignments and multiple contradictions, indicating a high level of hallucination."
