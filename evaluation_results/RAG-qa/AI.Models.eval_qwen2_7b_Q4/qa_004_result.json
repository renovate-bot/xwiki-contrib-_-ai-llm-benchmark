  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the answer is highly relevant and provides a clear solution to disabling notifications in XWiki. However, the inclusion of the URL 'https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/' is irrelevant to the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly states that system filters can be found within notification management options, which is not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and ranked correctly. However, the second node, which 'does not provide specific information on how to disable notifications or manage automatic page watching,' is irrelevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because some relevant information is present in the nodes in retrieval context, such as automatic creation of custom notification filters, but key details about changing settings and deleting filters are missing.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is perfectly relevant and there are no reasons for irrelevancy. Great job!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions indicating that the actual output does not align with the provided context."
