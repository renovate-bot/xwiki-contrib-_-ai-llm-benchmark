  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the specific question about configuring spaces and permissions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.82 because the actual output incorrectly states that the notion of space has been removed from the XWiki UI multiple times, which contradicts the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node discusses the creation of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki but does not address access control or permissions configuration, the second node is about executing a migration plan and does not relate to configuring access control or permissions in XWiki, and the third node explains the XAR export feature in XWiki, which is unrelated to setting up access control or permissions for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses unrelated topics like page creation, migration processes, and XAR export functionality, none of which address configuring permissions for team spaces in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, such as creating pages and spaces, executing a plan, migration process, XAR export, and related administrative actions. There are no contradictions, but the omissions result in a high hallucination score."
