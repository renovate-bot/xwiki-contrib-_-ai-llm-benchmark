  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.70 because the response partially addresses the question about disabling notifications but includes irrelevant information such as a URL that does not directly address the question and a statement about contacting support, which is not directly related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the first rank mentions 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences' and 'Notifications Custom Filters Preferences,' which are directly related to managing notifications and filters. The irrelevant nodes about email notifications and RSS feeds are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, showing a perfect match.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not directly address how to disable notifications, which is the main concern of the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output aligns perfectly with the context, with no contradictions or hallucinations present."
