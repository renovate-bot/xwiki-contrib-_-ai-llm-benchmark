  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the provided URLs do not directly address the issue of the notification bell not being available, even though the main concern is about the notification feature.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses features and extensions in XWiki but does not address enabling notifications. The second node lists notification preferences macros without providing information on enabling notifications. The third node talks about following a user and default watch settings but does not mention enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context mentions notifications and user preferences but does not specify defining the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` on `true`.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various unrelated features and settings, such as 'Menu application', 'Notifications', and 'Invitation', which do not address the issue of the bell icon not being available even with the 'Notification d'alerte' extension installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to address multiple specific features, preferences, and settings mentioned in the context, leading to a high level of factual misalignment."
