  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the main content is relevant and helpful, but the inclusion of a URL that does not directly address the question slightly detracts from the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.82 because the actual output incorrectly attributes the ability to execute arbitrary Java code to space administrators instead of programmers, and it incorrectly states that denying the `Script` right affects space administrators, whereas the retrieval context only mentions programmers.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses programming rights but does not address denying script rights to a space administrator. Similarly, the second node about Color Themes and access rights for unregistered users is unrelated, and the third node provides instructions on changing main wiki access rights without mentioning the specific case of denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provided does not mention anything about denying script rights to a space administrator and focuses on unrelated rights and permissions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several specific details that are present in the context, leading to a high degree of omission and thus a high hallucination score."
