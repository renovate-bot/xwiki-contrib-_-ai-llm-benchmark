  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, it includes irrelevant URLs that do not pertain to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'AuthorizationSettler and access decisions', the second node is about 'blocked attachment mimetypes and their configuration', and the third node focuses on the 'checkAccess() method for access control'. None of these are related to enabling notifications for user actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like AuthorizationSettler, attachment mimetypes, and access control, which are unrelated to the input question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with the contexts provided and discusses unrelated topics, indicating a complete hallucination."
