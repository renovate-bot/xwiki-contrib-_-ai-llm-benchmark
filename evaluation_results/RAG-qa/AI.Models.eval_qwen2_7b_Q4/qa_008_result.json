  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer provides useful information but includes several URLs and a statement that do not directly address the specific question about restricting uploads to images or PDF files of up to 10MB.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly claims that XWiki does not allow files with MIME types `text/plain` and anything under `image/` except images, as well as PDF files, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node, which is irrelevant, is ranked higher than the second and third nodes. The first node 'does not address configuring allowed mimetypes or setting maximum attachment size,' while the second node 'mentions configuring mimetype restrictions,' and the third node 'provides detailed steps on how to set the maximum attachment size.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.58 because while the retrieval context nodes provide steps to configure mimetype restrictions and set the maximum attachment size (supporting sentences 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11), they do not mention restricting uploads specifically to images or PDFs, nor do they provide the exact line to add in the `xwiki.properties` file (unsupporting sentences 1, 3, and 4).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses adding attachments and blocking certain mimetypes but does not address limiting uploads to images or PDFs of a maximum 10MB.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output omits significant details mentioned in the context, such as the 'top level menu' and 'WYSIWYG editor' methods for adding attachments, configuring mimetype restrictions through the administration UI, and the methods of uploading attachments through 'upload action', 'WebDAV', 'XML-RPC', or 'Rest'. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
