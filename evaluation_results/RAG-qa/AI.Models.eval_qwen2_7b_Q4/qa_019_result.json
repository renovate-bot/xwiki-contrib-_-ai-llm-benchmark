  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes a URL that does not directly address the question of how to deny script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.85 because the actual output incorrectly states that the AuthorizationSettler can be configured via the XWiki-Backoffice Interface, while the retrieval context specifies configuration through the xwiki.properties file. Additionally, the actual output misrepresents the `unregister(Right right) throws AuthorizationException` method by claiming it allows removing or deactivating an existing right, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that the exception is thrown only if the right is not custom.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) is ranked lower than two irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and access decisions, which does not address the specific question. The second node is about registering and unregistering custom rights, which is also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output with relevant details.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses 'AuthorizationSettler', 'right definitions', and methods for registering/unregistering rights, but does not address how to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output aligns perfectly with the context provided, with no contradictions or hallucinations present."
