  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant to the question about restricting file uploads to images or PDFs with a maximum size of 10 MB. However, it includes a URL that is not directly related to the specific query, which slightly reduces its relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context are not relevant to configuring MIME types or maximum upload sizes. For example, the first node discusses 'HTTP methods and media types for retrieving page history and children', the second node details 'HTTP methods for managing page translations', and the third node talks about 'creating a new wiki and retrieving lists of spaces'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the steps or configurations mentioned in the expected output are present in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides information about various API endpoints and their descriptions, which does not address the input question about ensuring that only images or PDF files with a maximum size of 10 MB can be uploaded as attachments in the wiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output is completely unrelated to the context provided. It discusses file upload settings in a wiki instead of describing the API endpoints and their details as specified in the context."
