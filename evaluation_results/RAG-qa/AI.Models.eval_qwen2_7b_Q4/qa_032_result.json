  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.70 because the answer provides some relevant information, but it includes multiple URLs that do not directly address the question about authenticating users with an access token.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node about JWT token requirements is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes about blocked attachment mimetypes and custom authentication using a Groovy script are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while some key details like configuration parameters and JWT token requirements are covered by nodes in the retrieval context, the step-by-step process and specific limitations of the authenticator are not mentioned.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses blocked attachment mimetypes and custom authentication methods, which are unrelated to the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks critical information about configuring blocked attachment mimetypes and creating custom authentication using a Groovy script, which are present in the context. However, it correctly aligns with the context regarding the use of a JWT token signed with an Ed25519 key and the required claims for authentication."
