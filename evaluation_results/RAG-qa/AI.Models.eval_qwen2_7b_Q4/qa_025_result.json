  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims that setting cookies on a top-level domain will work for all wikis, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that this approach will fail if the wikis have very different domains.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context discuss general information about OpenID Connect, domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, and dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension, but none address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts. This makes the irrelevant nodes ranked higher than the relevant information.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because the retrieval context only partially supports the expected output. While it mentions modifying the `xwiki.properties` file, it does not provide specific details about the `oidc.enableUser` property or the steps to activate user accounts.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about OpenID Connect configuration but does not specifically address how to configure XWiki to automatically activate user accounts upon their first login.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions indicating that the actual output does not align with the provided context."
