  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly suggests configuring the cookie JSESSIONID for automatic user activation in a domain-based XWiki system, while the retrieval context states that this approach will not work if the XWiki instance has very different domains for its wikis.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts on first login with OpenID Connect. For example, the first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator', and the third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically activate user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several specific details mentioned in the context, such as configuring the session cookie for domain-based instances, prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, and specific configuration guides for different systems."
