  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the provided link to XWiki syntax documentation is irrelevant to the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, the rest of the answer might still contain useful information related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node 'provides links and descriptions of various notification preferences macros, but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.' The second node 'discusses email notifications and their configuration, but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions.' The third node 'explains pre-filtering and post-filtering of notifications, but does not provide information on enabling notifications for one's own actions.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output with relevant nodes aligning with all key concepts.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses general notification settings, email notifications, and technical details, but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to provide any of the specific information described in the context, such as notifications, preferences, email notifications, filtering modes, and thread pool settings. This complete lack of alignment with the context results in a high hallucination score."
