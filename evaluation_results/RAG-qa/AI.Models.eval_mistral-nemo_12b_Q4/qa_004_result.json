  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information on managing notifications in XWiki. However, it includes a link about XWiki syntax, which is not directly related to the question about disabling notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first node is relevant, providing information on 'custom location filters that allow you to restrict on which locations you want to receive notifications.' However, the second node, which is irrelevant, is ranked higher than the third node. The second node 'lists different notification preferences macros and does not provide specific information on how to disable notifications,' while the third node explains that 'watching a location automatically create a custom notification filter,' which is relevant to managing notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is perfectly relevant and clear!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output fails to mention the 'System user' or 'superadmin account' as described in the context, despite aligning with other aspects of managing notifications and filters."
