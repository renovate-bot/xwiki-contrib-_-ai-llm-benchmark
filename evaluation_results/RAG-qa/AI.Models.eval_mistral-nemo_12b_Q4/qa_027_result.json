  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes a URL related to Scalability and Performance, which is not pertinent to the specific configuration query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in retrieval context discuss unrelated topics such as 'XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering' (first node), 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration' (second node), and general 'OpenID Connect configuration guides' (third node), none of which address the process of configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities, which are not relevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not fully align with the context, missing key details such as scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering features, domain-based instance authentication, and specific configuration examples for systems like Lemon LDAP, Keycloak, or Univention Corporate Server."
