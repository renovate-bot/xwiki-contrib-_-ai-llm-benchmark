  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant URLs that do not pertain to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'blocked attachment mimetypes,' the second node is about 'programming rights and permissions within a wiki environment,' and the third node details 'various user rights such as comment, edit, delete, and administration rights,' none of which are related to notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses configuration and permissions, which do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks crucial information about blocked attachment mimetypes, specific rights (programming, register, create wikis, script), and their configurations, which are necessary for factual completeness."
