  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the provided URL does not directly address the issue of the bell icon not being available, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job maintaining perfect alignment!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides 'general information about the menu and various extensions' but does not address the specific issue. The second node lists 'various notification-related macros and preferences' without providing relevant information. The third node explains 'how to follow a user and the default watch settings' but does not mention the issue at hand.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions 'Notifications' and their purpose in the wiki (1st node), it does not provide information about setting the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context contains information about various applications and features in XWiki, which are irrelevant to the specific issue of the bell icon not being available even when the 'Notification d'alerte' extension is installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently does not align with the provided context, discussing unrelated troubleshooting steps instead of the features, notification preferences, macros, and settings described in the context."
