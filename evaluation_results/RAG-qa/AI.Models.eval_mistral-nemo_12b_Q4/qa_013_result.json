  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.29 because the output contains several irrelevant statements and URLs that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, it does acknowledge the lack of information on the specific issue, which is why the score is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context are not relevant to the input. The first node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and right definitions, which are not related to notifications about one's own activity. The second node is about blocked attachment mimetypes and their configuration, which does not relate to enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node talks about the checkAccess() method and access violations, which is unrelated to the topic of receiving notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like AuthorizationSettler, blocked attachment mimetypes, and access control methods, which are unrelated to the input query about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key elements described in the context, such as the AuthorizationSettler, ConfigurationSource, RightDescription, blocked attachment mimetypes, administration UI, checkAccess() method, and access violation logging. These omissions indicate a high degree of hallucination."
