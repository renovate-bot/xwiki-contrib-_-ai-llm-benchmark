  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the majority of the response is relevant to customizing user profile fields from OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes irrelevant information about database support and forms in XWiki, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is not relevant to mapping user profile fields from OpenID Connect. Similarly, the second node talks about 'XWiki's database efficiency and programming features,' which is unrelated to customizing user profile fields from OpenID Connect. Lastly, the third node describes 'form utilization on XWiki.org,' which does not pertain to mapping user profile fields from OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, which are irrelevant to customizing or mapping user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information that aligns with the provided contexts, leading to a complete misalignment with the expected content."
