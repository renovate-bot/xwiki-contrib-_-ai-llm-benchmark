  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.42 because the output contains multiple irrelevant links and phrases that do not directly address the specific configuration question about setting permissions in XWiki. However, there is some relevant information that partially addresses the question, which is why the score is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying true to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides a general introduction to XWiki without addressing specific configuration steps for access control. The second node explains features of wikis, including rights management, but lacks the detailed steps needed. The third node describes what a wiki is and its advantages, but does not provide any information on configuring access control in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about XWiki and wikis but does not address the specific question about configuring team-specific access and editing permissions in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information that aligns with the context, such as details on setting up and using XWiki, distinctions between first and second generation wikis, and explanations of what a wiki is and its advantages over traditional CMS and ECM."
