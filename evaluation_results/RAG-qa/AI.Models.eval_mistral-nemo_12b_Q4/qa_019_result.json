  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer provides useful information but includes irrelevant links that do not directly address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and access decisions, which does not address denying script rights to a domain administrator. The second node explains registering and unregistering custom rights, but not denying script rights. The third node describes various rights but does not mention denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses the AuthorizationSettler and its configuration, which is not directly related to denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks significant details that are crucial for alignment with the context, such as information about the AuthorizationSettler, right definitions, the process of registering and unregistering rights, and specifics about comment, edit, delete, and administration rights. There are no contradictions, but the absence of these key details results in a high hallucination score."
