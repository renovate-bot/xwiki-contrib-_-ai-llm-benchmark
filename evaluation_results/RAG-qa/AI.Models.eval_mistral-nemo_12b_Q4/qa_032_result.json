  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node that provides detailed information about JWT token generation is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes about blocked attachment mimetypes and custom authentication using Groovy scripts are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are accurately supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses attachment mimetype restrictions and custom authentication methods, but it does not specifically address the use of access tokens for user authentication.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output does not align with multiple key points in the provided context, specifically regarding blocked attachment mimetypes, their configuration, and custom authentication methods, indicating a significant level of hallucination."
