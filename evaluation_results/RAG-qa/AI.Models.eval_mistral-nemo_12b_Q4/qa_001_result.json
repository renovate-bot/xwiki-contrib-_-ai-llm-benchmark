  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the provided URLs are not directly relevant to the issue with the 'Bell' icon in XWiki. However, the response is partially relevant as it acknowledges the context of XWiki and the 'Alert Notification' extension.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node should be ranked lower as it does not provide information on enabling notifications, the second node should be ranked lower as it does not provide instructions on enabling notifications in the wiki, and the third node should be ranked lower as it does not mention how to enable notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context discusses the importance of enabling notifications (supporting sentence 1), it does not mention the specific `notifications.enabled` setting or the `xwiki.properties` file (unsupportive for sentence 2).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context includes irrelevant information such as 'Menu application', 'What's New Application', and 'notification preferences', none of which address the availability of the 'Bell' icon or the 'Alert Notification' extension.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to include several key pieces of information mentioned in the context, such as the Menu application, the Invitation application, the What's New Application, and various notification preferences macros, leading to a high hallucination score."
