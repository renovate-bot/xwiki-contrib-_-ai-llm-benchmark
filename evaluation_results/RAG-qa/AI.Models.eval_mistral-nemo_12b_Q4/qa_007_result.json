  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first node provides detailed information on configuring the `oidc.groups.claim` property, which is essential for synchronizing groups between XWiki and the OpenID Connect provider. The second node, which discusses domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, is not relevant and should be ranked lower than the third node, which provides information on enabling group synchronization and mapping XWiki groups to provider groups using the `oidc.groups.mapping` property.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.46 because while the retrieval context supports configuring and setting properties like `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping` (sentences 3, 5, 7), it lacks information on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file (sentences 1, 2), configuring the `oidc.groups.separator` property (sentences 8, 9), and saving and restarting the XWiki instance (sentence 12).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address the process of configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output aligns with the context in terms of group synchronization but fails to mention the crucial aspect of authentication with a domain-based instance or session cookie configuration, leading to partial misalignment."
