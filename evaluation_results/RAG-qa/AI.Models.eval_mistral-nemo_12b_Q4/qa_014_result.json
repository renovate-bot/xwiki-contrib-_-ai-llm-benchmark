  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant URLs and a statement that does not address the question about disabling notifications. However, it still partially addresses the topic, which is why it is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'blocked attachment mimetypes and their configuration', the second node is about 'setting the default language in a wiki editor', and the third node addresses 'directory cleanup and database attachment storage'. None of these contexts are related to disabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, setting the default language in a wiki editor, and directory cleanup in XWiki, none of which are related to disabling notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output provides relevant links for some contexts but fails to address specific contexts about directory cleanup and database attachment store settings, leading to partial alignment and some contradictions."
