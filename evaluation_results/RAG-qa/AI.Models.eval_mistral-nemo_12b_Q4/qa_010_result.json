  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.68 because the response includes some relevant information but is diluted by multiple irrelevant statements and unhelpful keywords.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.73 because the actual output incorrectly references the 'Spaces' section and 'Permissions' tab in XWiki, which have been removed from the UI according to the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access control for teams in XWiki. For example, the first node discusses creating and managing spaces and pages, the second node talks about executing a migration plan, and the third node explains the XAR export feature. None of these nodes provide information on access control configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses migration plans and XAR exports, which are unrelated to configuring team permissions in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key pieces of information that are present in the context, such as details about user-created pages being called WebHome, the concept of Terminal Pages, executing a plan, the potential for a long process, recommendations for migration, XAR export, the internal XML format, and the conditions under which the export tree is displayed."
