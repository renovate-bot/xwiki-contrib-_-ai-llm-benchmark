  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly states that attachment mimetypes are restricted to images and PDFs, and mentions setting `attachment.upload.blockList` to `application/*,audio/*,video/*`, which is not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node, which is irrelevant, is ranked higher than the second and third nodes. The first node 'does not address configuring allowed mimetypes or setting maximum attachment size', while the second node 'mentions configuring blocked attachment mimetypes' and the third node 'explains how to set the maximum attachment size', which are both directly relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.73 because while the retrieval context provides relevant information about configuring mimetypes and setting maximum attachment size, it lacks specific details about limiting uploads to images or PDF files of maximum 10MB and the exact steps to configure allowed mimetypes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses adding attachments and configuring mimetype restrictions, but does not address limiting uploads to images or PDF files of a maximum of 10MB.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output omits several key details provided in the context, such as the methods for adding attachments, the list of blocked attachment mimetypes, and the methods for uploading attachments and default size limits. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
