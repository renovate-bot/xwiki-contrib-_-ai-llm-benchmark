  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information, but the inclusion of the XWiki syntax link is unnecessary and does not pertain to the question about notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context ranked 1, 2, and 3 are irrelevant. The first node lists various notification preferences macros but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The second node describes various ways to receive notifications in XWiki but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The third node explains how to configure email notifications and their frequency but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context only partially supports the expected output. While it mentions 'notification settings in your user profile' in the 1st node, it does not address the default behavior of not receiving notifications about one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various notification-related macros and methods in XWiki but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks alignment with the specific details provided in the context, despite not containing direct contradictions."
