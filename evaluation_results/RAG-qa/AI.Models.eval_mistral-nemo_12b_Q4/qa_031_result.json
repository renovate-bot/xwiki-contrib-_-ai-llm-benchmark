  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens. However, it includes a URL that does not directly address the question, which slightly reduces the relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the first rank provides detailed information about JWT token requirements, which is essential for understanding how to authenticate users with access tokens. The irrelevant nodes discussing document IDs and properties (second node) and cookie protection levels (third node) are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while the retrieval context mentions JWT tokens, required claims, and the 'Authorization' header, it lacks details on enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and the limitation on user creation or updating.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context focuses on document management in a wiki system and does not address user authentication or access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output fails to mention several key details from the context, such as returning a list of document IDs, document properties, various operations on documents, 'remember me' cookie functionality, IP address usage, security strategies, and Kerberos SSO Authentication. However, it does correctly align with the context regarding JWT token generation and usage."
