  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about disabling notifications, but the inclusion of the URL 'https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/' is irrelevant to the input.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly claims that users receive all notifications by default, whereas the retrieval context specifies that notifications are only sent by default when users are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first node addresses 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences' and 'Notifications Custom Filters Preferences,' which are directly related to the input. The second node, which is about email notifications, and the third node, which discusses notification RSS feed and general settings, are less relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the context is about email notifications, whereas the input is about disabling notifications for uninteresting pages.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output aligns with the context in explaining how to manage and customize notifications, but it fails to mention specific macros and their functions, which are important details from the context."
