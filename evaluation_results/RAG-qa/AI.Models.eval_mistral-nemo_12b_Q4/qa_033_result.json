  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the answer partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but contains multiple irrelevant statements and an incomplete sentence that do not contribute to the solution.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly specifies that the 'aud' claim must contain the URL of the XWiki installation in the form <https://www.example.com/> without a path, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context. The retrieval context only states that the 'aud' claim can be a single string or an array of strings and must contain the URL of the XWiki installation.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the first node discusses form utilization on XWiki.org and does not mention anything related to user authentication with access tokens, and the third node discusses various features and extensions available on XWiki but does not mention user authentication with access tokens. However, the second node provides detailed information on the requirements and process for generating a JWT token, which is directly relevant to authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses form utilization on XWiki.org and various wiki features, which are irrelevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output omits several key details mentioned in the context, such as the Reference Form, Questionnaire Form, Menu application, Notifications, and Invitation features, leading to a significant level of hallucination."
