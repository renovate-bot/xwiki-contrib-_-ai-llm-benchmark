  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration,' which does not address enabling user accounts upon first login using OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator,' but does not cover the specific configuration needed. The third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' which is also unrelated to the required configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because only the mention of the 'xwiki.properties' file in the 2nd node in the retrieval context supports the expected output, while other details such as adding or updating properties, uncommenting, saving the file, restarting the instance, and ensuring new user accounts are automatically enabled are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based instance configuration, session cookies, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to address several specific configurations, prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, and configuration guides that are described in the context. There are no contradictions, but the lack of alignment with the context results in a high hallucination score."
