  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the notification issue in XWiki, but it includes a link to XWiki Syntax documentation, which is not directly related to resolving notification issues.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output incorrectly states that the Notifications Email Preferences Macro manages the preferences, while the retrieval context only mentions that it displays them.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) provides information about different ways to receive notifications in XWiki, which is directly related to the input. However, the first two nodes are not directly related to enabling notifications or subscribing to pages or users, and they are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.29 because only parts of the expected output related to watching pages and enabling notifications via the bell icon are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, while other key details such as enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties`, subscribing to pages or users, following users, and the 'network' tab are not mentioned.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context only provides information about the 'What's New Application' in XWiki and does not address issues related to not receiving notifications in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because all the factual alignments indicate that the actual output is consistent with the context, and there are no contradictions."
