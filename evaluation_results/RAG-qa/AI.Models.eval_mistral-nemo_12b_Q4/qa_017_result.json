  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and mostly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, the inclusion of a link to the Scalability and Performance documentation is slightly off-topic and does not directly contribute to solving the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node provides 'installation instructions, dependencies, and general descriptions' instead of specific steps for configuring group synchronization. The second node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is unrelated to the input. The third node talks about 'scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities,' which are also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses unrelated topics such as 'domain-based authentication' and 'XWiki's scalability,' which do not address the specific process of synchronizing groups between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output fails to mention key points such as domain-based instances, session cookies, scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering, which are discussed in the context. Additionally, there is only one alignment related to the OpenID Connect Authenticator page."
