  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.57 because the actual output incorrectly references the `oidc.user.mapping` property multiple times, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context. Instead, the retrieval context mentions `oidc.user.nameFormater` and `oidc.user.subjectFormater`.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the first rank directly addresses the question of customizing user profile fields, while the irrelevant nodes in the second and third ranks discuss domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, as well as group synchronization and other unrelated topics.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.83 because while the retrieval context accurately covers the mapping of user profile fields and provides examples, it does not mention the need to save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart XWiki to apply the changes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses authentication configurations, session cookies, and group synchronization, which do not address customizing or mapping user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks important details about authentication with a domain-based instance, session cookie configuration, and group synchronization using the `xwiki_groups` claim, which are present in the context. However, it correctly mentions the use of the `oidc.user.mapping` property."
