  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the response included multiple irrelevant URLs that did not directly address the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output incorrectly states that the LLM Application Authenticator expects a JWT token signed with an Ed2 key, while the retrieval context specifies it should be signed with an Ed25519 key.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which describes the requirements for the JWT token, is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes discussing endpoints in XWiki and domain-based authentication are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the information provided in the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context is about managing documents and domain-based instance configuration in XWiki, which does not address user authentication with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output contains significant misalignments with the context, such as incorrect key type and omission of key functionalities like document management and specific authentication methods."
