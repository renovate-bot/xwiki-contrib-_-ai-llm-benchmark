  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because while the response provides some relevant information, it includes multiple URLs and statements that are not directly related to the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node discussing 'JWT token generation' is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes about 'AuthorizationSettler and right definitions' and 'directory cleanup and database attachment stores' are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output can be directly attributed to the 1st node in the retrieval context, ensuring complete alignment.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses access decisions and directory cleanup, which are not relevant to authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks critical details about the AuthorizationSettler, its configuration, right definitions, Directory cleanup, Database Attachment Store, and specific settings for switching to the database attachment store, which are all described in the context. However, it correctly aligns with the context regarding the JWT token signed with an Ed25519 key and the necessary claims, including the OpenSSL commands for generating the signing key."
