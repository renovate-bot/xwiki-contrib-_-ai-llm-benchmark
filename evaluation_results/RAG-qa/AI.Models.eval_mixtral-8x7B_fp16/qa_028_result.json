  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.71 because the actual output contains several contradictions: it incorrectly states the conditions under which 'Programming' and 'Script' permissions can be granted or denied, conflicting with the retrieval context's specific details about how these permissions are managed and their default settings.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'version history of attachments, deletion, and storage mechanisms,' the second node talks about 'directory cleanup and database attachment storage,' and the third node is about 'programming rights and permissions within the wiki.' None of these are related to configuring MIME types or setting maximum upload sizes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses attachment versioning, storage mechanisms, and permissions, but it does not address restricting uploads to image or PDF files with a maximum size of 10 MB.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several critical details mentioned in the context, including information about storing attachments in the database, versioning and recycle bin settings, directory cleanup feature, and specific access rights settings for various permissions."
