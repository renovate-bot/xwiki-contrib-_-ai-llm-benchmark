  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response is mostly relevant and provides useful information about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, it includes URLs that are not directly related to the specific question asked, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output incorrectly states that changes in notification settings might not apply to past events, whereas the retrieval context clearly mentions that changes are considered for both past and future notifications.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node discusses email notifications and their configurations, but does not address notifications for one's own activity or how to enable them. The second node lists various notification preferences macros but does not provide information on enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node explains pre-filtering and post-filtering of notifications but does not mention anything about notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about not receiving notifications for one's own activity by default, nor does it mention the ability to disable this filter in the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section of the notification settings.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses general email notifications, preferences, and technical details, but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions, indicating that the actual output does not align well with the provided context."
