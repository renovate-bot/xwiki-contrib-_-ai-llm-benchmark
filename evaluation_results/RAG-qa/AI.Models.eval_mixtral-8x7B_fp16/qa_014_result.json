  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the answer provides relevant information about disabling notifications, but includes several irrelevant links that do not address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'setting the default language for a page in a multilingual wiki,' the second node is about 'defining a list of blocked attachment mimetypes,' and the third node covers 'directory cleanup and database attachment storage settings.' None of these nodes address managing or disabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses setting the default language for a wiki page, configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, and directory cleanup in XWiki, none of which relate to the input question about disabling notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key details described in the context, such as setting the default language for a page, the list of blocked attachment mimetypes, and various settings related to attachment storage, despite providing relevant links."
