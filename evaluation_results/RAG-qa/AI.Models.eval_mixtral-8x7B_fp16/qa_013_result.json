  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the answer contains useful information but includes irrelevant URLs that do not address the specific question about enabling notifications for one's own activities.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses features of a wiki platform but does not address notifications for one's own activity. The second node talks about the checkAccess() method for access control, which is unrelated to enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node covers the AuthorizationSettler and right definitions for access control, which is also not relevant to the topic.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about not receiving notifications for one's own activity or the ability to disable a filter in the 'Advanced Filter Options' of the user's notification settings.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context contains irrelevant information such as 'Menu application', 'Display notifications about events happening in the wiki', and 'checkAccess()' method, which do not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output omits several key points mentioned in the context, such as the Menu application, notifications about events, the Invitation application, the checkAccess() method, access violations, security measures, the AuthorizationSettler, customizable components for access decisions, and right definitions."
