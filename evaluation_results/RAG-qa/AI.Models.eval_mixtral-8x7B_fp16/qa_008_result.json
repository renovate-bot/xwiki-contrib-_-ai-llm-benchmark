  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides a clear solution to the question, but the mention of the default attachment size being set at about 32 megabytes is not directly relevant to the specific requirement of limiting uploads to images or PDF files of up to 10MB.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly states that the list of blocked attachment mimetypes is configured by adding a line to the `xwiki.cfg` file, whereas the retrieval context specifies it is configured through the administration UI at the wiki or space level.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant nodes are not consistently ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'version history, deletion, and storage mechanisms for attachments,' which is not relevant to configuring allowed mimetypes or setting maximum attachment size. Similarly, the third node talks about 'linking to external files/images and backlinks indexation,' which is also irrelevant. However, the second node, which mentions 'configuring mimetype restrictions,' is relevant and correctly ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring the `xwiki.properties` file to restrict mimetypes and provides an example, it lacks details on setting the maximum attachment size to 10MB and the specific steps to navigate and configure XWikiPreferences.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses version control, deletion, storage mechanisms, and mimetype restrictions, none of which directly address ensuring only images or PDF files of a maximum of 10MB can be uploaded.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating perfect alignment."
