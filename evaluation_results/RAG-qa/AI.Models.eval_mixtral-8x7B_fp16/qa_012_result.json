  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.60 because the answer includes several irrelevant URLs and statements about XWiki features that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications. However, it still partially addresses the input, which is why it is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.75 because the provided content does not include documentation on XWiki's Attachment Validation UI.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node discusses 'the configuration of blocked attachment mimetypes', the second node explains 'how to edit translations in XWiki', and the third node covers 'security settings and authentication strategies', all of which are unrelated to enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses blocked attachment mimetypes, editing translations, and security configurations, none of which are related to the input 'Ich erhalte keine Benachrichtigungen.'",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several specific details mentioned in the context, such as configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, editing translations, and the protection level for the 'remember me' cookie functionality. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
