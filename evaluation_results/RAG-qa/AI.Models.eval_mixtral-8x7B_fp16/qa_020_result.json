  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because while the core instructions for configuring team areas and rights management in XWiki are provided, there are several irrelevant links included that do not directly address the specific configuration steps requested.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'efficiency and scalability of XWiki using relational databases,' the second node provides a 'general introduction to XWiki and its use cases,' and the third node, although mentioning 'rights management,' does not provide the specific steps needed for configuring access control. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than any relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.62 because while the retrieval context (node 3) supports setting rights for the entire wiki, specific areas, and inheriting rights for children pages, it does not mention creating groups for each team or adjusting rights for additional teams or areas.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses general features and use cases of XWiki, but does not address the specific configuration question about team-specific access and editing permissions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information about XWiki's database support, setup instructions, use cases, and specific features, which are essential to accurately describe the subject."
