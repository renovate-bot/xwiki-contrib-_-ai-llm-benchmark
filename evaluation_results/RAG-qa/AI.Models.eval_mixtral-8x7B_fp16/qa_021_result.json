  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes two URLs that do not specifically address the issue with the notifications bell icon.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node 'does not provide specific instructions on enabling notifications in the wiki', the second node 'does not mention the `notifications.enabled` property in `xwiki.properties`', and the third node 'does not provide information on enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 1st sentence about notifications is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, the 2nd sentence about defining the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` is not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the issue of the bell icon's availability despite the 'Notification d'alerte' extension being installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with the provided contexts and lacks the expected details about the Menu application, email notifications, and various macros for managing notifications preferences. There are no contradictions, but the absence of relevant information leads to a high hallucination score."
