  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because while the response contains some relevant information, it includes multiple URLs and statements that are not directly related to the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'various notification preferences and macros' without specific instructions, the second node mentions the Notifications application without detailed steps, and the third node is about 'creating and managing wikis and spaces,' which is unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context includes irrelevant information such as 'Menu application', 'Invitation', and 'Other features can be added to your wiki by installing extensions not listed above' which do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output lacks specific details about HTTP methods, media types, and status codes for certain endpoints, despite aligning well with the context on notifications and the Notifications Application."
