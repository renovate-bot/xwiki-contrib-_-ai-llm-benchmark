  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.21 because the majority of the statements in the output are irrelevant to the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the script right is tied to the administrator's role and is granted automatically when the administrator role is assigned, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) that directly answers the question, 'A very important detail is that the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page,' is ranked lower than three irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses setting rights for pages and their children but does not address the specific question. The second node talks about comment rights, edit rights, and delete rights but does not mention anything about denying script rights. The fourth node discusses programming rights, register rights, and create wikis rights but does not address denying script rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the information provided in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not specifically address how to refuse script rights to an administrator, focusing instead on other rights and general access settings.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several specific details and steps mentioned in the context, such as setting rights for a page and its children, and details about comment, edit, delete, special permissions, programming right, register right, and create wikis right."
