  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes statements that acknowledge the lack of direct information and mention settings not directly related to the configuration issue, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies' and does not address enabling user accounts upon first login. The second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator and its dependencies' but does not mention the specific configuration needed. The third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' without providing information on configuring user account enablement upon first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various aspects of OpenID Connect but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to address key details and specific information mentioned in the context, such as authentication with a domain-based instance, session cookies, servlet container configuration, prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, and configuration guides for OpenID Connect in XWiki."
