  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, the inclusion of unrelated links slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides links and descriptions of various notification-related macros but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The second node lists different ways to receive notifications in XWiki but does not explain how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The third node discusses other features and extensions that can be added to a wiki but does not provide information on enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about notification features and other XWiki applications but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and all the provided contradictions are actually agreements, indicating that the actual output is fully aligned with the context."
