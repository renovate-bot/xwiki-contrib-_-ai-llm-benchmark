  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the question, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.78 because the actual output includes conditions about the `exp` claim being more than 24 hours in the past and the `iat` claim not being in the future, which are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node is ranked first, providing detailed information on the requirements for the JWT token, while the irrelevant nodes discussing administration configurations and wiki extensions are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.62 because while the retrieval context nodes mention key aspects like JWT tokens, specific claims, and the use of Ed25519 keys (supporting sentences 1, 2, 3, and 4), they do not cover details about setting properties in the `xwiki.properties` file, configuring authorized applications, or the limitations of the authenticator (unsupportive of sentences 5, 6, and 7).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses application configuration and wiki platform features, which are unrelated to authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks critical information about ConfigurableClass objects, their properties, and additional applications and features that can be added to the wiki, leading to significant omissions. However, it correctly aligns with the context regarding the steps to generate a signing key, create a JWT token, and send it in the Authorization header."
