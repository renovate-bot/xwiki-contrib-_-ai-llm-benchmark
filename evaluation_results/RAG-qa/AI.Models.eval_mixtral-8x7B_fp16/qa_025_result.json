  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the answer provides relevant information about configuring XWiki for automatic user account activation with OpenID Connect, but it includes irrelevant details about disabling OpenID Connect and options not activating user accounts automatically.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'domain-based instances and session cookie configuration', the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator' without addressing the specific configuration needed, and the third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based instance configuration, session cookies, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to automatically activate user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output aligns with the context on several points, such as mentioning configuration guides for specific systems and not contradicting information about dependencies. However, it lacks details on updating the session cookie configuration and specific steps for Tomcat, leading to some degree of hallucination."
