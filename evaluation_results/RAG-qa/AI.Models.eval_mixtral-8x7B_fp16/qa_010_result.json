  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides a clear solution to configuring permissions in XWiki, but it includes a link that does not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly references the 'space' tool in the UI, which has been removed according to the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is relevant, is ranked correctly and provides details on the permission system in XWiki. However, the first and third nodes are irrelevant as they do not provide information on configuring access rights or permissions. The first node explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages, and the third node is about executing a migration plan.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the 2nd node in the retrieval context, which discusses setting rights at different levels, managing rights for groups, and inheriting rights for child pages. However, the retrieval context does not mention adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context explains the concept of spaces and pages in XWiki and discusses a migration plan, but it does not address how to configure permissions for teams.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output fails to address key contexts about the creation and management of pages and spaces in XWiki, as well as the execution of the migration plan, which indicates significant omissions. However, it correctly aligns with the context regarding the granular permission system in XWiki."
