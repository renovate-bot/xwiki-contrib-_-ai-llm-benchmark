  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the process of configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes are relevant and provide essential information on configuring group synchronization, such as the `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties. However, the second node, which discusses domain-based instance authentication and cookie settings, is irrelevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks details on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, replacing placeholders with actual values, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, which are not relevant to the query about synchronizing groups between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output aligns with the context regarding group synchronization and the use of specific properties (`oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping`), but it does not address other context areas such as domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration."
