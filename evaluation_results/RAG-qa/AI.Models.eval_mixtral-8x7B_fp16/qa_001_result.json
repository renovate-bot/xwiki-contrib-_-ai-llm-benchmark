  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes some general information and unrelated details about configuring email notifications, which do not directly address the specific issue of the 'Bell' icon or the 'Alert Notification' extension.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses various features and extensions in XWiki but does not address the 'Bell' or notifications. The second node talks about a 'What's New Application' for news, which is not related to enabling notifications. The third node focuses on email notifications and their configurations, not on enabling the 'Bell' or notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions 'notifications' and provides some details on 'notification preferences' and 'email notifications', it does not mention 'xwiki.properties' or how to enable notifications through it.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various XWiki extensions and features but does not address the availability of the 'Bell' icon or the 'Alert Notification' extension.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output includes information about the 'Bell' icon and the 'Alert Notification' extension that is not mentioned in the context, leading to a significant level of hallucination."
