  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is completely relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all the relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and `oidc.user.mapping` property, which are directly relevant to customizing user profile fields and mapping them from the OpenID Connect provider, while the third node primarily discusses in-wiki configuration and does not provide information on customizing user profile fields or mapping them.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.83 because while the 2nd node in the retrieval context covers most aspects of customizing user profile fields, including 'oidc.user.mapping' and examples, it does not mention saving the 'xwiki.properties' file or restarting XWiki."
