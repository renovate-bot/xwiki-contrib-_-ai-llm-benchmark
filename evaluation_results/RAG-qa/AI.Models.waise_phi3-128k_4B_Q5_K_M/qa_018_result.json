  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the provided URL does not directly address the specific requirement of ensuring only images or PDF files with a maximum size of 10 MB can be uploaded. However, the answer contains some relevant information that partially addresses the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which provides 'detailed steps on how to set the maximum size of an attachment', is relevant and ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. However, the first node, ranked first, 'contains links to various sections related to attachments but does not provide specific details on configuring MIME types or attachment size limits', which should be ranked lower. Additionally, the third node, ranked third, 'contains general information about the document lifecycle and does not mention MIME type restrictions or attachment size limits', which should also be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.45 because while the retrieval context includes steps related to changing the maximum size of an attachment (supporting sentences 6-10), it lacks information on configuring allowed MIME types and editing the `xwiki.properties` file (unsupporting sentences 1-5)."
