  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the output is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a statement about creating a user from an external system, which is not directly related to configuring automatic activation of user accounts with OpenID Connect.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For instance, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but lacks specifics on enabling user accounts upon first login. Similarly, the third node mentions the `xwiki.properties` file but does not include the necessary configuration (`oidc.enableUser=true`) for automatic activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the details provided in the nodes in the retrieval context, especially the 2nd node which thoroughly covers the necessary configuration settings in 'xwiki.properties'. Great job!"
