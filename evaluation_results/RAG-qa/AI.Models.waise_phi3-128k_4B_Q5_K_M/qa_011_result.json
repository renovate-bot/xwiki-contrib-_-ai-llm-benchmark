  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and directly addresses the input query without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output incorrectly states that the notification above and to the right is not available, while the retrieval context indicates that notifications are indeed present above the bell in the top menu.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node 'does not address the specific issue of the bell icon not being available or how to enable notifications', and similar issues are present with the subsequent nodes, such as the second node 'not providing any specific information on enabling notifications or resolving the issue of the bell icon not being available'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the expected output partially matches the retrieval context, specifically the mention of editing the xwiki.properties file, but lacks explicit details about setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`."
