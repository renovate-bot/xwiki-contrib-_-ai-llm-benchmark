    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the answer contains some relevant information about denying script rights to an area administrator, but it also includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various validation mechanisms in XWiki' which does not address the issue of denying script rights to a domain administrator. The second node lists 'various image references and links to different XWiki pages,' which is unrelated to the question. Similarly, the third node talks about 'recommended templates and creating terminal pages with template providers,' which does not provide information on denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the sentence in the expected output does not match any content from the nodes in the retrieval context."
