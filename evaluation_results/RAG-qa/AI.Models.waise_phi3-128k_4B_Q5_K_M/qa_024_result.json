    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the main part of the answer addresses the question about disabling unwanted notifications, but the inclusion of an irrelevant URL link reduces the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in retrieval context, which explains the 'Auto Watch' feature and how to change this behavior in the settings, is ranked fifth. The irrelevant nodes, such as the first node that lists notification-related macros and their descriptions, and the second node that describes different notification settings and filters but does not explain how to disable notifications, are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the first three sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the 5th node in the retrieval context, but the fourth sentence lacks direct support from any node in the retrieval context."
