  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.57 because the answer contains several irrelevant suggestions related to PHP, C++ API, and installation configuration, which are not pertinent to customizing user profile fields in XWiki. However, it does address the core question about mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki properties, which gives it some relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output incorrectly states the need for a PHP extension file, suggests using the XWiki C++ API, and mentions a 'setUserProfile' method, none of which are supported by the retrieval context for the OpenID Connect Authenticator.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval contexts is ranked fifth. The first four nodes provide information on the OpenID Connect Authenticator's general information, dependencies, functionality, and configuration files, which are irrelevant to user profile field customization or mapping.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are directly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring complete and accurate information."
