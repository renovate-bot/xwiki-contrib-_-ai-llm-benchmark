  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant, addressing the configuration of group synchronization between XWiki and the OpenID Connect provider without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node explaining the group synchronization process, including the `xwiki.properties` file and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property, is ranked first, ensuring that the most pertinent information is prioritized.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because while some key properties like `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping` are mentioned in the nodes in retrieval context, critical steps such as opening the file with a text editor, providing examples, and saving the file are missing."
