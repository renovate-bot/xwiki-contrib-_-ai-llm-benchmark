  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because while the response includes some relevant information about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, it also contains multiple irrelevant statements about LDAP Authenticator and general information that do not directly address the specific configuration issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the claim states that the LDAP Authenticator can be configured for OpenID Connect, but the retrieval context does not mention any such configuration for LDAP Authenticator with OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies,' which does not address the configuration needed for automatic user account activation. The second node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' which is also unrelated. The third node is about 'LDAP authentication and configuration,' which is not relevant. The fourth node mentions 'container authentication' but lacks specific configuration details for automatic user account activation. Lastly, the fifth node provides 'a general description and metadata' about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, but does not address the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the nodes in retrieval context mention configuration files and OpenID Connect, they lack specific instructions related to adding or updating properties, uncommenting settings, saving the file, or restarting XWiki."
