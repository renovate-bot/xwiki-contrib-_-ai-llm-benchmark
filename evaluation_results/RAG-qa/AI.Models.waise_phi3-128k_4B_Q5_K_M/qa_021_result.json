    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the issue without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job keeping the actual output perfectly aligned with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'provides links and descriptions of various features of the Notifications Application but does not address enabling notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context only partially supports the expected output, mentioning user notifications but not the specific property settings."
