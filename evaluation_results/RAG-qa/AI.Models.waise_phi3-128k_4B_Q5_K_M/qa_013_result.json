    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.60 because while the response attempts to provide helpful URLs, they are not directly relevant to enabling notifications for one's own actions, which is the core issue in the input.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'Authorized Applications Configuration', which does not address notifications or user activity settings. Additionally, the second node discusses customizing page templates and modifying CSS files, which is unrelated to notifications for user activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentences discuss notification settings and disabling filters, which are not mentioned in the nodes in the retrieval context."
