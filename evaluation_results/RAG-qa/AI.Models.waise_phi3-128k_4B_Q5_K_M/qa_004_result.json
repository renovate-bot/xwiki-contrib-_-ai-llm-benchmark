  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the provided URL does not directly address the query about how to disable notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining accuracy and faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) discussing 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode' and 'the automatic watch mode used by default' is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node focuses on 'Clear All' link, own event filter, and grouping notifications, which do not address disabling notifications or changing settings. Additionally, the second node is about enabling/disabling email notifications via configuration file, which is not relevant to user-level settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially supports the expected output. Specifically, sentence 1 and sentence 2 in the expected output are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context, while sentence 3 is partially supported by node 5 in the retrieval context."
