  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the answer mostly addresses configuring view and edit permissions in XWiki, but includes some irrelevant statements about Nested Pages Migration, Page Editing, and general configuration, which are not directly related to the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first node provides relevant information about the granular permission system in XWiki, and the third node explains the rules for setting wiki-wide and page-level rights. However, the second node, which discusses how pages and spaces are created and named, should be ranked lower because it is not relevant to configuring access control. Similarly, the fourth node, which focuses on different editing modes, and the fifth node, which discusses the statistics feature, are also irrelevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output can be directly attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring complete alignment."
