  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information on how to map additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. However, it includes a statement about verifying if all required profiles have been applied, which is not directly relevant to the input question, and a polite closing 'Danke!' that is unrelated to the technical query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying accurate and faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the third rank, which provides details on various OpenID Connect configurations, is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. The first node, for example, only provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator and does not address customizing user profile fields or mapping additional fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly matches all sentences in the expected output, providing comprehensive and relevant information about customizing user profile fields in 'xwiki.properties' using 'oidc.user.mapping'."
