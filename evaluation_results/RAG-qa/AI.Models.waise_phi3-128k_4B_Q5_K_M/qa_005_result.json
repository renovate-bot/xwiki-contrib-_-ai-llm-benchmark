  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the configuration of OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes an irrelevant link to LDAP authentication which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'container authentication and LDAP configuration' and not 'enabling user accounts upon first login using OpenID Connect.' The second node, although mentioning 'OpenID Connect Authentication,' does not provide specific details about 'enabling user accounts upon first login.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the retrieval context nodes mention 'xwiki.properties' and configuring OIDC settings, they lack specific instructions about adding or updating the 'oidc.enableUser' property, uncommenting it, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance."
