    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.56 because the provided links to various documentation pages are not directly relevant to the specific task of refusing script rights to a space administrator. However, the answer does contain some relevant information, hence the score is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses the 'Script' right and its introduction, but does not address the ability to refuse script rights to an administrator. Additionally, the second node lists various rights and their default states, but does not provide information on refusing script rights specifically to an administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context."
