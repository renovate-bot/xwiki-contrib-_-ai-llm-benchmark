  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.14 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the specific question about configuring visibility and edit permissions in XWiki. The presence of these unrelated links and information significantly reduces the relevancy of the response.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which discusses managing users and groups in XWiki, is relevant to configuring access control and is correctly ranked high. However, the first node, which is about implementing a RESTful API in XWiki, is not relevant and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node on group synchronization using OpenID Connect, the fourth node on LDAP group settings, and the fifth node on nested pages and subwikis are also not directly relevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.14 because only the second sentence in the expected output is somewhat supported by the retrieval context, while the rest of the sentences do not align with any specific nodes in the retrieval context."
