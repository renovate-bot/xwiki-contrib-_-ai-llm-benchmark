  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which provides specific instructions for configuring group synchronization, is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node which only provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator without detailing the steps for group synchronization, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.73 because while the retrieval context covers several key configuration properties such as `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks specific instructions about locating, opening, and saving the `xwiki.properties` file, as well as restarting the XWiki instance."
