    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the provided links to various documentation features and extensions are irrelevant to the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'customizing page templates, menus, and CSS files', the second node discusses 'setting up languages and encoding adjustments', and the third node lists 'various references and images'. None of these are related to notifications, which is the topic of the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context."
