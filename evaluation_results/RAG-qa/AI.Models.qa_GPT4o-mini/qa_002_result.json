  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.67 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, explaining how to follow a user and receive notifications, which is crucial for ensuring notifications are set up correctly. However, the second node discusses 'filters and hidden pages,' which is not directly related to enabling notifications, and should be ranked lower. Additionally, the third node focuses on 'customizing the notification email template,' which is not directly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, and should also be ranked lower than relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context supports details about watching pages, following users, and using the 'network' tab (as seen in node 1 of the retrieval context), it lacks information about enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties' and subscribing to pages or users for notifications.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' and subscribing to pages.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions enabling notifications and watching users or pages, but lacks specific instructions on editing `xwiki.properties` and does not address using the 'alert' menu or checking the 'network' tab."
