  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) mentions enabling the notification module and email notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file, which is relevant to the expected output. However, irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, such as the first node that discusses how notifications are displayed and managed, the second node that lists dependencies for the notifications extension, and the third node that provides different ways to receive notifications without explaining how to enable them.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because only a few aspects of the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Specifically, the mention of 'notifications.enabled' in xwiki.properties and the alert menu represented by a bell are covered, but other details such as subscribing to pages or users, following a user, and the 'network' tab in the user profile are not mentioned.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching pages or users, but lacks detailed steps on how to do it and does not cover the network tab or user profile details."
