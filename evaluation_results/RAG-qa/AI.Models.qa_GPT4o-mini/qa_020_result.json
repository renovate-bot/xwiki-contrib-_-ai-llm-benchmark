  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because the response partially addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant links that do not directly relate to the task of setting permissions, which lowers the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database support and programming features,' which do not relate to configuring access controls for teams. The second node is about the 'Notifications Application,' which is unrelated to setting access permissions for teams in XWiki. The third node covers the 'Administration Application,' which involves user and group management but does not specifically address configuring team access permissions. Subsequent nodes continue to focus on unrelated topics such as 'Model Validation UI,' 'Nested Pages and subwikis,' and 'LDAP group configurations,' none of which provide the needed information for configuring team-specific access controls in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences from the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to creating groups, setting rights, or access control as described in the expected output."
