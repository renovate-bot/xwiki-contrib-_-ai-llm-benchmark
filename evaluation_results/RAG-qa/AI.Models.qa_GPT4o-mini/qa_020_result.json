  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer provides useful information about configuring access rights in XWiki, but it includes several irrelevant links to general documentation pages that do not directly address the specific question about team access configuration.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access control for teams in XWiki. For example, the first node discusses 'various actions that can be performed in XWiki,' the second node provides 'general information about wikis, panels, and their configurations,' and the third node lists 'various macros and their functionalities in XWiki.' These nodes should be ranked lower than relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, setting wiki-wide rights, or managing access rights for different teams as described in the expected output."
