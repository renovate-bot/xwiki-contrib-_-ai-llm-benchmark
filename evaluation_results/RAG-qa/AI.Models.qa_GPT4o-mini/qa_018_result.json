  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the input question about configuring upload restrictions, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to the solution.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.27 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the fifth node mentioning 'Size Limit' and 'Mimetype Restriction', and the sixth node providing steps to set the maximum size of an attachment, are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses trusted domains and PDF export customization, which are not relevant to configuring attachment restrictions, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.70 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide relevant information about 'Size Limit', 'Mimetype Restriction', and steps to change 'Maximum Upload Size', there is no specific mention of configuring MIME types or blocking other MIME types, which affects the completeness of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring attachment size and MIME type restrictions but lacks specific details on setting MIME types in xwiki.properties and the exact steps for setting size to 10MB.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output covers setting maximum upload size and MIME type restrictions but mentions 'Attachment Validation Application' not in expected output, and lacks precise steps for MIME configuration in `xwiki.properties`."
