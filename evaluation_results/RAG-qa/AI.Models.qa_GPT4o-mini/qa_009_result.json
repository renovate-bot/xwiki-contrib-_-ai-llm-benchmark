  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the main content effectively addresses the question about denying script rights, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to the solution.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'programming rights and their implications', but does not address the denial of script rights to a space administrator. The second node lists 'various rights and their properties', but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator. Similarly, the third node provides 'a tabular view of rights' but does not discuss the specific issue of denying script rights to a space administrator. All subsequent nodes also fail to address the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator, leading to a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, confirming that rights implied by admin cannot be denied. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context states that admin rights imply other rights and are not deniable, aligning with the expected output that rights implied by admin cannot be denied. However, the specific mention of 'unfortunately not supported in XWiki' is not directly found in the context."
