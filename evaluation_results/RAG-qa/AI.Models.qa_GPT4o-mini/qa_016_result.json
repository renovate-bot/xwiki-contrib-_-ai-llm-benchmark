  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response mostly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using OpenID Connect, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to the solution.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the sixth node, mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and includes examples of properties related to OpenID Connect, aligning with the expected output about mapping user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping`. However, it is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes, such as the first node, which discusses various authentication methods but does not mention customizing user profile fields or mapping properties in `xwiki.properties`. Additionally, the second node is about domain-based authentication and session cookies, which is unrelated to the input question. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, reducing the overall precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the information in the nodes in retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions the xwiki.properties file and OpenID Connect, but lacks details on customizing user profile fields or using oidc.user.mapping as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output covers key steps for configuring OpenID in XWiki and mentions the use of `xwiki.properties`, but lacks specific mapping examples and details about restarting XWiki as in the expected output."
