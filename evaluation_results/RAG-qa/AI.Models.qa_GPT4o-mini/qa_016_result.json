  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is mostly relevant and addresses the question about mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. However, the statement 'Zus\u00e4tzliche Felder in der Antwort.' is vague and does not directly contribute to solving the issue, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked sixth, mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and includes details about OpenID Connect endpoints, which is relevant to configuring user profile fields. However, the first five nodes are irrelevant as they discuss topics such as container authentication, domain-based authentication, and general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator without mentioning user profile field customization or the `xwiki.properties` file. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than the relevant node, leading to a lower score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 7th node in the retrieval context supports the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and 'oidc.user.mapping', key details such as the example mapping syntax, placeholder replacement instructions, and the need to save and restart XWiki are missing.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions OpenID Connect and xwiki.properties but lacks details on customizing user profile fields or using oidc.user.mapping as described in the expected output."
