    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node, which mentions configuration files including `xwiki.properties`, is ranked fifth. The first four nodes are irrelevant as they primarily provide links to prerequisites, describe general capabilities, mention various authentication methods, and list endpoints without detailing how to map additional user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring a perfect match.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions the xwiki.properties file but lacks details on customizing user profile fields using oidc.user.mapping."
