  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.62 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job maintaining consistency!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes about 'Authorized Applications' and JWT token generation, which are pertinent to token-based authentication, are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node focuses on 'LDAP authentication settings', which does not relate to token-based methods, while the second node is relevant as it discusses 'Authorized Applications'. Similarly, the fourth node, which is relevant due to its focus on 'JWT token generation and claims', is ranked lower than the first node. This misordering affects the precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job on achieving a perfect match!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context fully supports the expected answer by detailing the use of JWT tokens, required claims, Ed25519 key signing, and configuration steps for the Token-based authentication extension."
