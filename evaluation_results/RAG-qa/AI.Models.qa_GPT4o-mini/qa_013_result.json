  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because the output contains several URLs that are not relevant to enabling notifications for one's own actions, which detracts from the overall relevancy. However, the score is not lower because the output likely contains some useful information or correct URLs related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about 'token generation and JWT tokens', which is unrelated to notifications for user activity. Similarly, the second node discusses 'database migration and invalid extensions', which does not pertain to notifications for user activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user activity filters mentioned in the expected answer."
