  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the response partially addresses the question about disabling notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help with the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'various notification filters and settings' but lacks information on 'automatic page watching' or disabling such notifications. The second node lists 'different notification preferences and macros' without addressing how to stop notifications for 'automatically watched pages'. The third node provides 'a list of notification settings and options' but does not cover 'automatic following of pages'. The fourth node talks about 'RSS feeds and notification settings' without mentioning 'automatic watching of pages'. Lastly, the fifth node outlines 'various notification methods in XWiki' but fails to address 'automatically watched pages'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while nodes in the retrieval context support the idea of default notification settings and accessing notification settings (as seen in nodes 2 and 4), they do not explicitly mention being notified of changes on one's own work, which affects the completeness of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions auto-watched pages and notification settings, but lacks details on modifying 'Suivi automatique des pages' and removing filters from 'Filtres personnalis\u00e9s'."
