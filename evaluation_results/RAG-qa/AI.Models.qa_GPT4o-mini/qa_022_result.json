  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes a source link and a link to XWiki syntax documentation that are not directly related to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.72 because relevant nodes are generally ranked higher, such as the first node discussing 'Enable and disable the extension' and the third node about 'Follow a user', which are pertinent to receiving notifications. However, the second node, which focuses on 'email frequency and template customization', is ranked higher than it should be, as it does not directly address enabling notifications. Similarly, the fourth node on 'RSS feeds and macro settings' and the fifth node about 'displaying notification preferences' are also ranked higher than necessary, affecting the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several nodes in the retrieval context support the expected output, such as enabling notifications and following users or pages (nodes 1 and 3), there are missing details about specific configurations like 'xwiki.properties' and the 'r\u00e9seau' tab, which are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' and specific steps for following pages or users."
