  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.72 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the first node mentioning 'Enable and disable the extension' and 'Enabling notifications for all users by default', are ranked higher. However, irrelevant nodes like the second node, which focuses on 'email frequency and template customization', and the fourth node, discussing 'RSS feeds and notification grouping', are not directly related to enabling notifications and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide support for activating notifications and following pages or users (as seen in sentences 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the expected output), they lack specific references to the 'notifications.enabled' property and the 'r\u00e9seau' tab (related to sentences 2 and 6).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users or pages, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` and specific steps for following users or pages.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides general troubleshooting steps for notifications but lacks specific instructions on enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties' or following pages/users as mentioned in the expected output."
