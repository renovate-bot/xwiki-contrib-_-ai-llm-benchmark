  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes several irrelevant links that do not directly pertain to the topic, thus preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'upgrading XWiki' and lacks any mention of 'user authentication with access tokens'. The second node focuses on 'features of the Administration Application' without addressing 'authentication with access tokens'. The third node, while mentioning 'user authentication and access authorization', does not specifically cover 'authentication using access tokens'. The fourth node is about 'managing rights and user profiles', which is not related to 'authenticating users with access tokens'. Lastly, the fifth node provides 'a table of rights constants', which is unrelated to the topic of 'authenticating users with access tokens'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output could be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context lacks any mention of token-based authentication, JWT specifics, or related configuration details.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about token-based authentication, JWT, or the specific configurations mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions authentication with access tokens in XWiki and involves configuration, but lacks specific details about JWT requirements, Ed25519 key, and the process outlined in the expected output. It also misses the limitations of the authenticator."
