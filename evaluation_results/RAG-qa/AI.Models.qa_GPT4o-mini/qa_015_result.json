  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node describes general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not provide any information on how to automatically activate user accounts upon first login. Similarly, the second node provides a table of contents and links to various sections related to the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and 'OpenID Connect' in the 2nd node in the retrieval context aligns with the expected output. However, there are no specific instructions or details about updating properties, uncommenting, saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, or ensuring new user accounts are automatically activated.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
