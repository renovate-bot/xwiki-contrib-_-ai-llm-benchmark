  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the configuration issue with OpenID Connect in XWiki without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job maintaining consistency!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', which is unrelated to 'automatically activating user accounts with OpenID Connect in XWiki'. The second node provides information on 'container authentication and various authentication methods', but does not mention the specific configuration needed. Subsequent nodes continue to lack relevance, such as the third node which describes the 'OpenID Connect Authenticator extension and its capabilities', but does not provide the specific configuration details needed for automatic user account activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context mentions the xwiki.properties file and properties related to OpenID Connect, none of the nodes provide specific information about automatically activating user accounts on first login or updating the `oidc.enableUser` property.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the 'oidc.enableUser' property or the need to update 'xwiki.properties' to activate user accounts automatically.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output incorrectly refers to the `xwiki.cfg` file and the `xwiki.authentication.createuser` setting, while the expected output specifies modifying `xwiki.properties` and setting `oidc.enableUser=true` for automatic user activation."
