  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect, without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', which is unrelated to enabling user accounts automatically upon first login with OpenID Connect. The second node mentions OpenID Connect but lacks information about automatic user activation. Subsequent nodes also fail to address the specific configuration needed for automatic user activation, focusing instead on topics like 'installation', 'general information', 'properties and endpoints', 'dependencies', and a 'table of contents'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and the `oidc.enableUser` setting in node 5, it lacks specific instructions and the effect of the configuration change, leading to partial alignment with the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any mention of the xwiki.properties file or the oidc.enableUser property, which are essential for automatic user account activation as described in the expected output."
