  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. However, it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'validation patterns and script execution', which is not related to denying script rights to an admin in XWiki. The second node is about 'page creation templates' and does not address rights management or script permissions. The third node describes a 'custom right check class and configuration', but it does not mention script rights or their denial. The fourth node involves 'field validation and registration processes', which are unrelated to script rights or administrative permissions. Finally, the fifth node discusses 'access rights and execution contexts', but it does not specifically address the inability to deny script rights to an admin in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence about admin rights in XWiki does not correspond to any nodes in the retrieval context, as none of them mention admin rights or their implications.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about XWiki not supporting the denial of rights implied by admin rights, which is the main point of the expected output."
