  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the main answer addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but several irrelevant links about XWiki skins, authentication, LDAP authentication, and forms reduce the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is a list of image links and references, which does not address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node is about configuring Kerberos and LDAP authentication in XWiki, which is unrelated to the question about script rights for a space administrator. The third node discusses mail templates for password reset and username recovery, which is not relevant to the question about script rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the sentence 'Leider wird dies in XWiki nicht unterst\u00fctzt, Rechte, die durch das Admin-Recht impliziert sind, k\u00f6nnen nicht verweigert werden.' is not found in any part of the retrieval context, which primarily contains references to images, LDAP configuration, and form usage.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about rights implied by the admin right in XWiki."
