  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because while the response addresses the configuration of permissions in XWiki, it includes several irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem, thus preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.21 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the sixth node discussing 'XWiki's permission system, including setting view and edit rights at different levels,' and the eighth node outlining 'the basic rules for setting rights in XWiki, including wiki-wide and page-level rights,' are ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node discusses 'content organization and rights inheritance in XWiki but does not provide specific steps for configuring view and edit permissions for teams,' and the second node explains 'the parent/child relationship and nested spaces concept but does not address how to set view and edit permissions for teams,' both of which should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the expected output sentences are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, particularly the 6th node which covers various aspects of access control and rights management. However, there is a lack of specific information regarding adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces, which affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions rights inheritance and administration features, but lacks details on creating groups, setting specific rights, and ensuring teams can only edit their own spaces."
