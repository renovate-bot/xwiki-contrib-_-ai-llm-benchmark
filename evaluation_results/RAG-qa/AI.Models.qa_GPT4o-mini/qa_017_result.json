  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.23 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, which discuss 'group synchronization' and the 'oidc.groups.mapping' property, are ranked lower (sixth and seventh) than the irrelevant nodes. The irrelevant nodes, ranked from first to fifth, focus on topics like 'authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints', 'container authentication', 'domain-based authentication', 'OpenID Connect authentication', and 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', which do not address group synchronization with OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only a few elements from the expected output, such as the 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.mapping' properties, are supported by nodes in the retrieval context. Most of the detailed steps and configurations mentioned in the expected output, like setting up group synchronization, finding and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, and specific configuration instructions, are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks specific instructions on configuring group synchronization properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' as detailed in the expected output."
