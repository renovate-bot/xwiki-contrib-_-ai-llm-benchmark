  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes statements that offer sources and links without directly addressing the specific process of setting up group synchronization, which slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.12 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which describes the group synchronization process and mentions the use of the 'oidc.groups.mapping' property, is ranked eighth. However, irrelevant nodes, such as the first node focusing on 'authentication management and endpoints' without mentioning group synchronization, and the second node discussing 'container authentication and LDAP', are ranked higher, which lowers the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.27 because while some nodes in the retrieval context mention relevant properties like 'xwiki.properties', 'oidc.groups.mapping', and 'oidc.groups.separator', many specific details and examples from the expected output are missing, such as instructions for opening the file, specific configuration examples, and steps for saving and restarting XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and configuration in xwiki.properties but lacks specific details on configuring oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, and oidc.groups.mapping as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output lacks specific instructions for configuring 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.separator'. It mentions 'oidc.userinfoclaims' and 'oidc.groups.mapping' instead, which is inconsistent with expected output. The sequence and context around file editing and restarting XWiki are missing."
