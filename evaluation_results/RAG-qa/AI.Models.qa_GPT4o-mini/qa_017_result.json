  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides general information about OpenID Connect and its integration with XWiki but does not provide specific steps for configuring group synchronization. The second node mentions allowing XWiki to authenticate with an OpenID Connect provider but does not mention group synchronization or the specific configuration steps required. The third node describes container authentication and other authentication methods but does not address group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The fourth node lists various configuration guides and files but does not provide the detailed steps for setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The fifth node provides links to configuration guides for specific systems and mentions the `xwiki.properties` file but does not detail the steps for configuring group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.64 because while the retrieval context nodes mention key configuration elements like 'xwiki.properties', 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', they lack specific instructions such as opening the file with a text editor, replacing placeholders, and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization but lacks detailed steps and properties configuration found in the expected output."
