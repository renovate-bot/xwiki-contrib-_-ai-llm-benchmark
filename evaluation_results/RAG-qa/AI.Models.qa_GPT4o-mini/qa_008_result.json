  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output perfectly addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node, which mentions 'setting limits on the maximum size of an attachment and configuring it in XWikiPreferences', is ranked fifth. The first four nodes discuss unrelated topics such as 'linking to external files and images', 'general information about XWiki's structure', 'adding attachments without addressing restrictions', and 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', which should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.78 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide detailed steps for configuring maximum upload size (Step 2, sentences 3-7), the introductory and explanatory parts of Step 1 (sentences 1-2) lack direct support from the retrieval context nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details about configuring xwiki.properties and setting size to 10MB."
