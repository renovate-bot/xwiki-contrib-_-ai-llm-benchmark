  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information, but the inclusion of a link to XWiki syntax documentation slightly detracts from the focus on setting upload restrictions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node that provides detailed steps on setting the maximum size of an attachment in the XWikiPreferences document is ranked first, while all irrelevant nodes discussing topics like moving attachments, whitelists and blacklists, linking to external files, and linking to attachments and anchors are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context covers the steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (Step 2), it does not mention the steps for configuring allowed mimetypes (Step 1).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains steps for setting maximum attachment size and mentions mimetype restrictions, but lacks specific details on configuring the `xwiki.properties` file and the exact mimetype allow list."
