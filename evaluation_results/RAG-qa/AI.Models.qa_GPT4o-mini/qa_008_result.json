  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which 'mentions setting limits on the maximum size of an attachment and provides steps to change it', is ranked fifth. However, several irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, such as the first node, which 'discusses linking to external files and images, which is unrelated to configuring upload restrictions for attachments', and the second node, which 'provides general information about XWiki pages and their components, not about configuring attachment upload settings'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.58 because while several steps related to configuring maximum attachment size (Step 2) are well-supported by node 5 in the retrieval context, key instructions regarding mimetype configuration (Step 1) and ensuring only specific file types and sizes are allowed lack direct support from any node in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and configuring mimetype restrictions, but lacks specifics on editing xwiki.properties for mimetypes and setting 10MB limit.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly identifies the need to set a 10MB upload limit and specify allowed MIME types but suggests using the Attachment Validation Application instead of directly editing `xwiki.properties` for MIME types. It also includes additional steps like security settings and testing, which are not mentioned in the expected output."
