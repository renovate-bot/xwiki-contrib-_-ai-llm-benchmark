  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes links to unrelated topics like XWiki skins and a security module extension, which slightly detract from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first four nodes contain 'image links and references which are not related to notifications or their settings', and the fifth node 'describes a security module and its ratings, which is unrelated to notification settings or issues'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains image links and unrelated text, lacking any information about enabling notifications or following pages/users as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks detailed instructions for enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties' and following pages, while focusing on troubleshooting steps instead."
