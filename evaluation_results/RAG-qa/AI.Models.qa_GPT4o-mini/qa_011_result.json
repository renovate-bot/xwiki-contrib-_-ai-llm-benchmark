  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant to the input, addressing the issue with the notification bell. However, it includes a link to XWiki syntax documentation, which is not directly related to the problem described, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings,' which is not pertinent to the input query about the availability of the notification bell. Similarly, the second node lists 'various ways to receive notifications but does not mention enabling notifications through the xwiki.properties file,' which again does not relate to the input issue. As a result, there are no relevant nodes ranked higher than irrelevant ones.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 6th node in the retrieval context suggests that notifications can be configured, there is no specific mention in any node about setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' to 'true', which is a key detail in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, which is the key information in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes information about troubleshooting notification issues and does not directly address enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties`. It mentions user permissions and extension compatibility, which are not in the expected output."
