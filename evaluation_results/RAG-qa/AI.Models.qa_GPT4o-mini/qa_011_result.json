  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response mostly addresses the issue of the notification bell not being available, but includes irrelevant information about sources and documentation links that do not directly relate to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. Each node, from the first to the seventh, discusses topics such as 'custom notification filters', 'different ways to receive notifications', 'notification preferences macros', 'Notifications Application', 'various settings and developer options', 'configuring notifications for administrators', and 'email notification settings', none of which address enabling notifications in the wiki settings. Therefore, they should all be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, which is the key information in the expected answer."
