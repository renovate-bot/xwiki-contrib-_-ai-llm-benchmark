    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer provides relevant information on how to disable notifications, but it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about disabling notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'XWiki Syntax and formatting features,' which does not address disabling notifications. Similarly, the second node describes 'an extension for authenticating users with JSON Web Tokens,' which is also unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about automatic page following, notification settings, or custom filters mentioned in the expected output."
