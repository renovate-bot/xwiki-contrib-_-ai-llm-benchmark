  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.56 because the output contains several irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the question about disabling notifications, which lowers the score. However, the presence of some relevant information about notifications keeps the score above the midpoint.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'attaching files' and the second node talks about 'moving attachments', neither of which relate to notification settings or disabling notifications. Additionally, the third node is about 'displaying content and macros', which is also unrelated to the input query about disabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about automatic page following, notification settings, or custom filters as mentioned in the expected output."
