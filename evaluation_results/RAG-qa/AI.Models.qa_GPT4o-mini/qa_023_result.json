  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information on enabling notifications, but it includes URLs that are not directly related to the question about notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly states that users need to click on the bells to receive alerts for their own actions, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that notifications are received by default when users are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node ranked 2nd, which mentions 'Filter your own events,' is correctly identified as relevant. However, irrelevant nodes ranked 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th should be ranked lower as they do not address notifications for one's own activity. For example, the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and general notification settings but does not address notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output, with nodes in the retrieval context clearly explaining the notification settings and filtering options.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and the ability to filter notifications, but it lacks details on disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es'."
