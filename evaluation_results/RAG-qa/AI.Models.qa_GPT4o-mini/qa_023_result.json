  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is highly relevant to the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it includes an unnecessary link to XWiki syntax documentation, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states, 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is ranked first and directly addresses the input question about not receiving notifications for one's own activity. This ensures that irrelevant nodes, which discuss unrelated notification settings, lists of links, and other notification preferences, are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence of the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the second sentence about disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' lacks direct support from the retrieval context nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the option to change this in settings, aligning closely with the expected output. However, it does not explicitly mention 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es'."
