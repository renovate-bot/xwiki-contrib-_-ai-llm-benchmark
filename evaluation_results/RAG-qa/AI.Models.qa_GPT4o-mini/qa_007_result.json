  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first two nodes in the retrieval context are relevant, providing information on the 'oidc.groups.mapping' property and group synchronization process. However, the third node, ranked higher than it should be, discusses 'installation instructions and dependencies', which are not directly related to configuring group synchronization. Similarly, the fourth node, which discusses 'authentication management and endpoints', should be ranked lower as it is not relevant to the group synchronization process. Despite these misplacements, the relevant nodes are mostly ranked higher, contributing to the current score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide specific details about properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', they do not support the general instructions and introductory statements found in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about configuring the `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties, but lacks explicit instructions for locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, as well as saving and restarting XWiki."
