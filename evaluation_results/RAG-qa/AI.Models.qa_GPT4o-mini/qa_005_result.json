  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the core information about configuring user accounts with OpenID Connect is mostly relevant, but the inclusion of unrelated links slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly states that the `xwiki.authentication.createuser=empty` property in the `xwiki.cfg` file is related to OpenID Connect, while the retrieval context specifies that this configuration is for Container Authentication.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific configuration needed to enable user accounts upon first login. Similarly, the second node discusses container authentication without providing details on configuring the `xwiki.properties` file or enabling user accounts upon first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the xwiki.properties file or the oidc.enableUser property."
