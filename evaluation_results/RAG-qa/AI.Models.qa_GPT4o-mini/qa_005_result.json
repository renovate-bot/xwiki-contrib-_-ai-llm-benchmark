  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes an irrelevant mention of LDAP authentication, which slightly detracts from the overall focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses the property '# oidc.enableUser=true' necessary for enabling user accounts on first login, is ranked first. This ensures that the most pertinent information is prioritized over irrelevant nodes discussing topics like domain-based authentication, password recovery, and general OpenID Connect configurations.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context supports the instructions to adjust the `xwiki.properties` file and set the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true`, it lacks information about saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, and ensuring new user accounts are automatically enabled on first login via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the exact information from the expected output, specifically mentioning the property `oidc.enableUser=true` in the `xwiki.properties` file, which matches the expected answer.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly describes adjusting the `oidc.enableUser` property, saving the file, and restarting XWiki. It omits the specific commenting/uncommenting detail present in the expected output."
