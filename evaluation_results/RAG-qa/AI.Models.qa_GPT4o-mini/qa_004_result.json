  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response mostly addresses how to disable notifications in XWiki, but includes a source link and a standalone 'Filters:' statement that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.27 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node discusses 'following a user and default watch settings,' which does not address disabling notifications, while the fourth node, which is relevant, mentions 'administrators can change users' notification settings.' Additionally, the second node focuses on 'details of changes and macros for settings,' which is not pertinent, whereas the seventh node, which is relevant, discusses 'filtering notifications, including advanced filtering options.' These relevant nodes should be ranked higher to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because most of the expected output is supported by node 5 in the retrieval context, which covers automatic page watching, changing settings, and custom filters. However, the retrieval context does not mention notifications about changes to your work specifically, leading to a partial match.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and notification settings in user profiles, but lacks details about automatic page watching for major modifications and deleting notification filters.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides steps for managing notifications but lacks key facts about automatic page watching and deleting custom filters from the expected output."
