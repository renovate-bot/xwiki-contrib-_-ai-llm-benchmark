  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information on how to disable notifications in XWiki. However, it includes a source link that does not directly address the question, slightly impacting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly claims the existence of an 'Advanced filtering options' section to disable notifications about your own activity or hide minor events, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.29 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not ranked as high as they should be. The fourth node is relevant as it 'mentions that administrators can change users' notification settings and discusses auto-watched mode,' but it is preceded by three irrelevant nodes. The first node is irrelevant because it 'discusses following a user and default watch settings, but does not mention how to disable notifications or manage notification settings in the user profile.' Similarly, the second node 'talks about the details of changes in notifications and macros for settings, but does not provide information on disabling notifications or managing notification settings.' The third node 'focuses on enabling and disabling the email feature and customizing live email notifications,' which is not directly related to the input query. Additionally, the sixth node, which is relevant as it 'discusses the settings of the notifications menu and mentions that users can enable or disable notification types,' is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the 5th node in the retrieval context supports most of the expected output by discussing automatic page watching, user profile settings, and custom filters. However, it does not specifically mention being notified about changes on your work, which affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings but lacks specific details about automatic page watching and deleting notification filters."
