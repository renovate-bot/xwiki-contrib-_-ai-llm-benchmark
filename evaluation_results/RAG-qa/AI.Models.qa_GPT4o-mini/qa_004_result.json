  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and consistency!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.37 because irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than relevant ones. For instance, the first node discusses enabling/disabling the notification module and email notifications at the platform level, which is not directly relevant to the user's question about disabling notifications for specific pages. Similarly, the second node explains how to get an RSS feed of notifications and mentions the settings menu, but it does not provide specific information about disabling notifications for certain pages. These should be ranked lower than the third node, which mentions 'Watch and custom filters' and provides a link to more details, and the fifth node, which mentions 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode,' both of which are directly relevant to the user's question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context nodes mention default notification settings related to user actions on pages they created or updated (supporting sentences 1 and 2), there is no information about changing 'Automatic page watching' settings or deleting notification filters in the 'Custom Filters' list (unsupporting sentences 3 and 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions 'auto-watched mode' and 'custom filters' but lacks details on automatic page watching, notification settings, and deleting filters."
