  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes a link to the XWiki RESTful API documentation, which is not directly relevant to the specific configuration issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context provide general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, container authentication, or various authentication methods, but none of them address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, such as its developer, active installs, and license, but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or setting the `oidc.enableUser` property to true."
