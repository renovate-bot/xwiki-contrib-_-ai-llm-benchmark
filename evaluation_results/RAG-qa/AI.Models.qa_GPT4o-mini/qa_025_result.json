  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, with only a minor irrelevant mention of LDAP Authenticator, which does not significantly detract from the overall helpfulness of the answer.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.40 because the actual output incorrectly associates the setting `xwiki.authentication.createuser=empty` with OpenID Connect, while the retrieval context clearly states it is for Container Authentication. This misalignment occurs multiple times, indicating a significant deviation from the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context is relevant as it 'mentions the xwiki.properties file, which is directly related to the configuration needed to enable user accounts automatically with OpenID Connect.' However, the first node is irrelevant since it 'discusses domain-based authentication and session cookies, which are not relevant to enabling user accounts automatically on first login with OpenID Connect.' This misplacement of an irrelevant node before a relevant one affects the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and OpenID Connect in the 2nd node in retrieval context supports the expected output, while other details like specific property changes, uncommenting instructions, saving, restarting, and automatic activation are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions xwiki.properties but lacks specific details about setting oidc.enableUser to true for automatic user activation on first login.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output incorrectly references `xwiki.cfg` and `xwiki.authentication.createuser=empty` instead of `xwiki.properties` and `oidc.enableUser=true` as in expected output. No mention of user activation, only creation."
