    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant and provides useful information on enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, it includes an unrelated statement about RSS features, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. Great job on maintaining perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the information from the expected output, including the default behavior of not receiving notifications about one's own activity unless explicitly targeted, and the ability to change this setting in the 'Advanced filtering options' of the user profile."
