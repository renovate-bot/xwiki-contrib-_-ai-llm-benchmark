    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of the notification bell not being available, but it includes links that are not directly related to solving this specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which mentions the 'notifications.enabled' property in 'xwiki.properties', is ranked fourth. The first three nodes are irrelevant as they discuss 'custom notification filters and their behavior', 'various notification preferences', and 'notification filters and settings', none of which address enabling notifications in the wiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context explicitly mentions enabling notifications by setting 'notifications.enabled' to true in xwiki.properties, which matches the expected output."
