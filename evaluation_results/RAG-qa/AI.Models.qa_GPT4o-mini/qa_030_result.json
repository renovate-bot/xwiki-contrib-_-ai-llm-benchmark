  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the response addresses the main question about configuring access rights in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the task, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides metadata about a page in XWiki, but it does not address access control or permissions. The second node discusses modifying resources using XML and HTTP methods, which is unrelated to setting access permissions in XWiki. The third node is about adding and managing comments, which is not relevant to configuring access rights for spaces in XWiki. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than any relevant nodes, resulting in a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context lacks any mention of the specific steps, rights settings, or group configurations described in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to creating groups, setting rights, or inheriting rights in XWiki as outlined in the expected output."
