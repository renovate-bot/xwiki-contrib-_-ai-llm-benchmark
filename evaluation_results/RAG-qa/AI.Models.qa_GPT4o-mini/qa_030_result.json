  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because the answer addresses the main question about configuring team spaces in XWiki, but it is not higher due to repeated irrelevant source links that do not contribute to solving the specific configuration issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question about configuring access permissions in XWiki. For example, the first node discusses 'the structure of an XWiki page, including metadata like author and version', which does not address access control or team spaces. The second node explains 'how to modify resources using XML and HTTP methods', which is not relevant to setting access permissions. Similarly, the third node is about 'adding, editing, and deleting comments', which is unrelated to configuring team access in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about creating groups, setting rights at wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes most of the necessary steps such as creating groups, configuring view and edit rights, and testing the configuration. However, it lacks details on setting rights at the wiki level for 'XWikiAllGroup' and inheriting rights to child pages."
