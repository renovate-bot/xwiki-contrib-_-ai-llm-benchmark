  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.68 because the output contains some relevant information about script rights, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly address the specific question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the second node which 'explains the implications of programming rights and mentions that script rights are part of the administrative rights, which cannot be denied once granted', and the fourth node which 'provides details on script rights and how they are managed, indicating that script rights are allowed by default unless explicitly revoked', are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node, discussing 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', is unrelated to script rights and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node about 'interacting with the XWiki RESTful API' is not relevant to script rights or administrative permissions and should also be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, with no discrepancies. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention that administrator rights cannot be refused, which is the key information in the expected output."
