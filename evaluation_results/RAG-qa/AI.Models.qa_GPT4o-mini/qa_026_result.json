  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer largely addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using OpenID Connect, but it is not higher due to repeated irrelevant statements providing source links that do not directly address the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'container authentication and various authentication methods', which does not mention customizing user profile fields. The second node is about 'domain-based instance configuration and session cookies', unrelated to mapping user profile fields. The third node lists features of the OpenID Connect Authenticator without providing information on mapping user profile fields. Subsequent nodes similarly fail to address the specific topic of mapping user profile fields in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while there is some relevant information in the nodes in retrieval context about OpenID Connect and xwiki.properties, specific details about mapping custom properties, replacing placeholders, and the steps to save and restart XWiki are missing.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions OpenID Connect and xwiki.properties but lacks specific details about customizing user profile fields or using oidc.user.mapping."
