  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which 'directly addresses group synchronization, mentioning the use of claims and mappings,' is ranked fourth. However, it is preceded by three irrelevant nodes that discuss 'authentication management and endpoints,' 'container authentication,' and 'domain-based instance authentication and session cookies,' none of which relate to group synchronization. This lowers the score as the relevant information should be ranked higher than these irrelevant contexts.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.30 because while the 4th node in the retrieval context supports configuring group synchronization using properties like `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping`, many key instructions such as locating the `xwiki.properties` file, opening it with a text editor, and specific examples for configuration are missing in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks details on configuring oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator, and saving changes in xwiki.properties."
