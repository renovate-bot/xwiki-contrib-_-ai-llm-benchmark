  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and provides detailed information on configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes a link to creating new users, which is not directly relevant to the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node that explains how to enable group synchronization by adding the claim xwiki_groups to the property oidc.userinfoclaims in the xwiki.properties file is ranked second. However, irrelevant nodes that provide general information about prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, developer details, active installs, license, endpoints, customization options, troubleshooting steps, and managing users and groups are ranked first, third, fourth, and fifth.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.23 because while the 2nd node in the retrieval context mentions configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks details on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, providing examples, and saving changes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring group synchronization in xwiki.properties and using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks detailed steps and examples found in the expected output."
