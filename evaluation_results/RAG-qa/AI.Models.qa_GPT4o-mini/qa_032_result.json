    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response was perfectly relevant and addressed the question directly. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about 'group synchronization and customization for OpenID Connect,' which is not related to authenticating users with access tokens. Similarly, the second node discusses 'protection levels for cookies and security strategies for failed login attempts,' which are also irrelevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication, JWT, or the specific steps outlined in the expected answer."
