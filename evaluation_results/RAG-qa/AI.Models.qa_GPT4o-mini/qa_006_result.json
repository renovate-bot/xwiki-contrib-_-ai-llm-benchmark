  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the response is mostly relevant to the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using OpenID Connect. However, it includes citations and suggestions to consult documentation, which do not directly address the specific customization query, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.62 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant and directly addresses customizing user profile fields with an example of mapping, which is highly pertinent to the input. However, several irrelevant nodes, such as the second node discussing 'access tokens and scopes', the third node about 'group claims and synchronization', and others, are ranked higher than the last relevant node, which lists available variables for mapping. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower to improve the precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because the retrieval context nodes support most of the expected output, particularly the customization and mapping of user profile fields in the `xwiki.properties` file (sentence 1-4). However, it lacks information on saving the file and restarting XWiki to apply changes (sentence 5).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the exact information from the expected output, including the ability to map user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file with examples provided.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output accurately describes customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` and provides example mappings. However, it includes additional information about using custom claims and consulting documentation, which is not present in the expected output."
