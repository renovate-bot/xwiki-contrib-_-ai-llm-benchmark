  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes are relevant and ranked high, discussing the `oidc.groups.mapping` property and group synchronization. However, the second node, ranked second, is irrelevant as it does not provide specific steps or properties related to configuring group synchronization in XWiki. Additionally, the fourth and fifth nodes, ranked fourth and fifth respectively, are irrelevant since one primarily lists dependencies and the other is a general description without specific steps.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly aligned with the nodes in the retrieval context, covering all mentioned configurations and steps accurately."
