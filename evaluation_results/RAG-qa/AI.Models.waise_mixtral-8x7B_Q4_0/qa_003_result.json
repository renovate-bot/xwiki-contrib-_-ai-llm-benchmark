  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the main points of how to enable notifications for the user's own actions are addressed, but the inclusion of irrelevant links to the Notifications Application page and the XWiki Syntax Documentation page prevents it from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node is about 'getting a notification RSS feed', the second node lists 'various notification preferences macros', the third node mentions 'different notification settings', the fourth node explains 'how to override default notification templates and installation instructions', and the fifth node discusses 'administrators configuring notifications for users'. None of these contexts address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions that users can go to the settings of the notifications (node 1), it does not mention that by default, one doesn't receive notifications about one's own activity."
