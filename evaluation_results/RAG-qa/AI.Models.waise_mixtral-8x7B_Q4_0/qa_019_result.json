    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.56 because while the response contains some relevant information, it is cluttered with multiple irrelevant statements and links that do not directly address the question about denying scripting rights.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'various validation mechanisms and messages', the second node contains 'links to images and references', the third node discusses 'template providers and their usage', the fourth node contains 'more references and images', and the fifth node contains 'code related to custom right checks.' None of these nodes address the question of script rights for an administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context provide information about rights, admin rights, or denying rights in XWiki."
