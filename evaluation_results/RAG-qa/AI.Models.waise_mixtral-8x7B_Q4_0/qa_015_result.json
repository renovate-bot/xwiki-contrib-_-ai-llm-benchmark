  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but the inclusion of the descriptive title 'Custom Authenticator Listener to activate user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.' slightly detracts from the direct focus on the configuration steps needed.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context provide general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, such as installation instructions, compatibility, and dependencies, but none address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts on first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because the retrieval context mentions 'xwiki.properties' and includes properties related to OpenID Connect, but it does not contain the specific property or instruction to 'add or update the following property'."
