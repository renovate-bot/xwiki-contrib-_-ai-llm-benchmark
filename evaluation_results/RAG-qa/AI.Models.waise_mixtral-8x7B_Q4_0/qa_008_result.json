  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about restricting file uploads to images and PDF files with a maximum size of 10MB. However, it includes statements like 'You can do this using the `hierarchy` API.' and 'For example:' which do not directly address the query and slightly detract from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the XWiki Extension Manager can be used to create new extensions, whereas the retrieval context specifies it is recommended for installing extensions.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the most relevant node, which discusses setting limits on the maximum size of an attachment and provides steps to change the maximum upload size in the XWikiPreferences document, is ranked first. Irrelevant nodes, such as those describing how to force certain attachment mime-types to always be downloaded (second node), discussing attachment version control and storage mechanisms (third node), explaining how to block uploads using JavaScript (fourth node), and providing instructions on how to add attachments using various UI elements (fifth node), are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.45 because while several sentences in the expected output are directly attributable to the nodes in the retrieval context, many introductory and explanatory sentences cannot be linked to any specific node."
