  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.97 because the actual output incorrectly states that the xwiki.oidc.groupSync property needs to be set to true in Admin > General Configuration, while the retrieval context specifies adding the claim xwiki_groups to the property oidc.userinfoclaims in the xwiki.properties file.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node providing information about 'group synchronization, including the use of the `oidc.userinfoclaims` property and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property' is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node, which 'contains general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, including installation instructions and dependencies,' are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while the retrieval context (4th node) mentions configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks details on specific steps such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, providing examples, and restarting the XWiki instance."
