    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the provided URLs are irrelevant to the specific instructions on how to enable notifications for one's own activity. However, the main content still addresses the core question effectively.",
    "Faithfulness": "Fantastic job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various sections and links related to notifications' but does not address receiving notifications for one's own activity. Similarly, the second node talks about 'different notification preferences and macros' without providing information on enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
