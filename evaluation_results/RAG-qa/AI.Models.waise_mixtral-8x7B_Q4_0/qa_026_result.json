    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.27 because the first four nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, providing general information, listing dependencies, installation instructions, and configuration guides for specific systems. These should be ranked lower than the fifth and sixth nodes, which discuss the `xwiki.properties` file and specific variables for mapping user profile fields, directly addressing the customization of user profile fields in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, providing clear and accurate mapping instructions."
