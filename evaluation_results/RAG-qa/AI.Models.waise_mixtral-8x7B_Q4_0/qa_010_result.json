  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and correctly addresses the configuration of access rights in XWiki. However, it includes links to content organization and page editing, which are not directly related to the specific query about configuring access rights.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output mentions an 'Admin' menu with an 'Access Rights' option, which is not found in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and provide detailed information on setting access rights in XWiki, which is essential for configuring the permissions as described in the input. However, the second node, which explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages, and the fourth node, which discusses advanced editing modes and profiles, are not relevant to the access control configuration and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.89 because most sentences in the expected output can be attributed to nodes in the retrieval context, specifically nodes 1 and 3, but there are some sentences that cannot be directly linked to any specific parts of the retrieval context."
