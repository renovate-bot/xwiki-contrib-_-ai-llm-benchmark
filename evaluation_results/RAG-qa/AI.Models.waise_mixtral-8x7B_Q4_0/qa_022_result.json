  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes a link to the XWiki Syntax documentation, which is not directly related.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the relevant nodes, such as the first node which includes a link to 'Settings' and the fourth node mentioning 'Notifications Filters Preferences', are generally ranked higher. However, some irrelevant nodes like the second node, which focuses on getting an RSS feed of notifications, and the third node, which discusses the 'Clear All' link, are ranked higher than they should be.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, particularly regarding enabling notifications, following pages and users, and viewing activities in the 'network' tab. However, there is no specific mention of setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' to 'true' in the provided context."
