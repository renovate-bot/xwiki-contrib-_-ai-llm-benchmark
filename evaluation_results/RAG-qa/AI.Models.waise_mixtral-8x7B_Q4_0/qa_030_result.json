    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about configuring team spaces in XWiki, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access control for teams. For example, the first node explains the underlying structure of pages and spaces in XWiki, the second node discusses migration steps and naming conventions, and the third node provides historical and technical details about the XWiki model.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context."
