  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant, but the inclusion of an unrelated URL slightly detracts from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the grace time for email notifications is defined in xwiki.properties and not under 'Email Notification' in the 'Preferences' menu.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node ranked first provides information on enabling the notification module and setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`, which is directly relevant to the expected output.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context supports enabling notifications and details about the 'alert' menu (1st and 2nd nodes in retrieval context), it lacks information on subscribing to pages or users, following a user from their profile, and the 'network' tab in the user profile."
