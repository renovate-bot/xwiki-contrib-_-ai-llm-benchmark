    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response was entirely relevant and directly addressed the question about disabling unwanted notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses how to clear notifications and the 'Own event filter', but it does not provide information on how to disable automatic notifications. Similarly, the second node addresses enabling and disabling email notifications via the administrator settings, not how a user can disable automatic notifications for pages they are not interested in.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because half of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context while the other half are not explicitly supported."
