  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question directly, but the mention of the 'read-only field' slightly detracts from the focus on denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly states that setting the tie resolution to `ALLOW` will deny script access, whereas it should be set to `DENY`.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses the 'Script' right and its implications, but it does not address the specific question of denying script rights to a space administrator. Similarly, the second node provides technical details on access checks and exceptions, which are not relevant to the question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the sentence 'This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.' does not match any specific content in the nodes in the retrieval context."
