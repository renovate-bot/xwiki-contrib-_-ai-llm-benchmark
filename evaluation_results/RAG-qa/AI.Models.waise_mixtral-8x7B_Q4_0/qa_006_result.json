    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and the `oidc.user.mapping` property, which are directly relevant, while the third node primarily discusses in-wiki configuration and multiple OIDC client configurations, which is not directly related to customizing user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
