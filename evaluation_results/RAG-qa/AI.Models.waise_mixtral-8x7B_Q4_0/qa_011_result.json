  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.10 because the majority of the statements in the actual output do not address the specific issue about the bell icon being unavailable, leading to a very low relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the bell icon is not part of the core XWiki functionality or the 'Alert Notification' extension, while the retrieval context indicates it is part of the Alert menu in the top bar.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node 'does not address how to enable notifications in the wiki settings,' which should be ranked lower. Similarly, the second node 'does not mention enabling notifications through xwiki.properties,' indicating it should also be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context indicates that notification settings can be configured by administrators, it does not provide specific details about the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` or how to set it to `true`."
