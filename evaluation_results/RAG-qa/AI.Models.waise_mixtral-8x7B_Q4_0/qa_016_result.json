  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant but includes a generic statement that does not directly address the specific question about mapping additional user profile fields from OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) that discusses configuring user profile field mappings in `xwiki.properties` is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node mainly provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, including prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies, but does not address the customization of user profile fields. Similarly, the second node lists dependencies but does not provide any information related to customizing user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring a perfect match. Great job!"
