  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the answer is highly relevant and mostly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes a minor irrelevant detail about installing an extension in XWiki, which slightly detracts from its precision.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, which means the actual output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the first and fifth nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant and ranked correctly for configuring group synchronization, providing key details and specific instructions. However, the second, third, and fourth nodes are less relevant, focusing on general descriptions, configuration properties, and dependencies, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
