  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about configuring OpenID Connect authentication in XWiki. However, it includes a link related to LDAP authentication, which is not pertinent to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about 'Container Authentication' and the second node provides a 'general description and links related to OpenID Connect Authentication' but neither addresses the configuration needed to enable user accounts upon their first login. Additionally, the third node discusses 'LDAP configuration', which is also unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the retrieval context nodes mention adjusting the xwiki.properties file for OIDC configuration, they do not specifically mention adding or updating the property, saving the file, restarting XWiki, or ensuring new user accounts are automatically enabled on first login via OpenID Connect."
