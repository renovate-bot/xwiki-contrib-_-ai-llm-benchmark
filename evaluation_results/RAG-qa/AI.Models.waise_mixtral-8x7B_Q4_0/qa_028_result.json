    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer mostly addresses the question about configuring attachment settings, but includes irrelevant links to XWiki syntax and skins documentation, which do not directly help with setting file type or size restrictions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are about unrelated tools, features, and references with images and links, which are not relevant to configuring file upload restrictions on a wiki. For example, the first node is about 'Notifications System Filters Preferences', the second node lists various references with images and links, and subsequent nodes continue to list similar irrelevant references.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context."
