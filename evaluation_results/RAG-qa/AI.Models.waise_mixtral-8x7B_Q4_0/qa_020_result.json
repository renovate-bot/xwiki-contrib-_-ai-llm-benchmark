    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because while the core response addresses the query about configuring team-specific permissions in XWiki, it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not contribute to solving the specific issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For instance, the first node discusses REST API resources, the second node contains an image and a link related to managing users and groups, and the third node discusses group synchronization using OpenID Connect. None of these provide information about configuring team access in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context."
