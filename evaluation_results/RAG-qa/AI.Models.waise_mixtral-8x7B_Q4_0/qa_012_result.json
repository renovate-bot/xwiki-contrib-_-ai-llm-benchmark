  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.07 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant statements and links that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output inaccurately claims that XAR supports importing/exporting of attachments and extensions, while the retrieval context only mentions importing pages or applications.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input 'Ich erhalte keine Benachrichtigungen'. The first node is about 'customizing page templates, adding menus, and modifying CSS files', which is unrelated to enabling notifications. The second node discusses 'setting up languages and encoding adjustments', which does not relate to notifications. The third node lists 'various references with images and links', which do not provide any information about enabling notifications. The fourth node is similar to the third, listing 'references with images and links', and is not relevant to notifications. The fifth node is about 'localization settings, including enabling multilingual mode and configuring date formats', which does not help with enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
