  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it includes an irrelevant URL about XWiki syntax documentation.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context that discuss 'notification preferences', 'email notifications', and 'pre-filtering and post-filtering of notifications' do not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not provide specific instructions on enabling notifications for one's own actions, focusing instead on general notification settings and configurations.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks specific details about notification macros, their functionalities, pre-filtering, post-filtering, and thread pool settings, which are present in the context. This indicates a significant amount of missing or incorrect information, leading to a higher hallucination score."
