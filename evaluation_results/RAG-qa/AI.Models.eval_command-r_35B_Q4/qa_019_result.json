  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.75 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the administration right is granted at a higher level and affects subordinate elements, while the retrieval context clarifies that the administration right can be granted at both the page and wiki levels, with the checking order being wiki > page.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and its configuration but does not address the specific question about denying script rights to a domain administrator. The second node is about registering and unregistering custom rights but does not provide information about denying script rights to a domain administrator. The third node explains various rights such as comment, edit, delete, and administration rights, but it does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses AuthorizationSettler and custom rights registration, which are not relevant to denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and all listed contradictions show agreement with the provided context, indicating no hallucination."
