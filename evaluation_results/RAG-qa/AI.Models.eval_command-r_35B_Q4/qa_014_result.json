  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the provided URLs are not directly relevant to the question about disabling notifications, which reduces the overall relevancy. However, the rest of the content likely addresses the question adequately, maintaining a relatively high score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first three nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to notifications or their settings. The first node discusses 'blocked attachment mimetypes', the second node is about 'setting the default language for a wiki page', and the third node addresses 'directory cleanup and database attachment storage'. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context is about configuring attachment mimetype restrictions, setting default language for a wiki page, and directory cleanup, none of which address the input question about disabling notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently fails to address the relevant topics mentioned in the factual alignments and instead discusses unrelated notification settings."
