  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the majority of the response is relevant and provides useful information about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect. However, the statement 'Die von Ihnen gesuchten Informationen befinden sich leider nicht in der von mir erhaltenen Ausgangsdaten.' is irrelevant and does not contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output incorrectly states that you need to edit the xwiki.cfg file to enable automatic user activation with OpenID Connect and that user accounts will be automatically activated upon first login, which are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'domain-based instances and session cookie configurations', the second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and its dependencies', and the third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension'. None of these address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts on first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookies, and general OpenID Connect information, none of which address the specific configuration needed for automatic user account activation in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not agree with any of the provided contexts, indicating a complete misalignment."
