  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly states that script rights can be granted or denied to the space administrator, while the retrieval context specifies that programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page. Additionally, the actual output mentions unchecking the 'Script' box to modify permissions, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the third node, which is relevant and states that 'the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page,' is ranked lower than the first and second nodes, which are irrelevant and discuss Color Themes, access rights, and comment, edit, and delete rights without addressing the specific question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, with no unsupportive reasons found. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses access rights and color themes but does not address how to refuse script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, including issues related to Color Themes, icon fonts, Forgot Username/Password functionality, Comment Right, Edit Right, Delete Right, Special Permissions, Programming Right, Register Right, and Create Wikis Right."
