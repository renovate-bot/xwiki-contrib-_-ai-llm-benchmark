  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the answer partially addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but the repeated irrelevant links detract from its overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node should be ranked lower as it only describes configuration display options in XWiki administration. The second node should also be ranked lower since it explains spaces and sub-pages without addressing access rights. The third node should be ranked lower as it discusses scalability and clustering, which are not relevant to configuring access rights for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to set permissions for teams to view all spaces while only modifying their own space in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions between the actual output and the context provided."
