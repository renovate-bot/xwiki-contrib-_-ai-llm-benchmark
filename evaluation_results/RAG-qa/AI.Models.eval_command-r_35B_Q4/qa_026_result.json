  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer provides some relevant information about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. However, it also includes links to documentation on database support and forms, which are not directly relevant to the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For instance, the first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', the second node talks about 'XWiki's database efficiency and programming features', and the third node describes 'form utilization on XWiki.org'. None of these are relevant to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and database storage, none of which are relevant to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several specific details mentioned in the context, such as authentication with a domain-based instance, session cookie configuration, bypassing OpenID Connect, relational database storage, efficiency, scalability, support for databases through Hibernate, and the utilization of reference and questionnaire forms on XWiki.org."
