  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.75 because the actual output does not align with the retrieval context regarding the setup of restrictions for uploads across the entire wiki, specifically configuring mimetype restrictions and setting maximum attachment sizes.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node, which is ranked highest, is not relevant as it describes how to add attachments using various methods but does not address configuring allowed mimetypes or setting maximum attachment size. However, the second and third nodes are relevant, as they mention configuring blocked mimetypes and provide steps on setting the maximum attachment size, respectively.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.73 because while the retrieval context nodes provide detailed steps and examples for configuring mimetypes and maximum attachment size (supporting sentences 2-4, 6-15), the introductory and step-introducing sentences (1, 5, 10) are not directly supported by any specific part of the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context provides instructions on adding attachments and configuring mimetype restrictions, but it does not address the specific requirement of limiting uploads to images or PDF files of a maximum 10MB.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output misses key details about adding attachments using the top level menu, attachment tab, or WYSIWYG editor, and does not mention the list of blocked attachment mimetypes or their configuration through the administration UI, which are essential parts of the context."
