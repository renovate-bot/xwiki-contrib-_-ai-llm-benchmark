  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes irrelevant URLs that do not address the problem directly.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'the configuration of blocked attachment mimetypes,' the second node is about 'programming rights within a wiki,' and the third node addresses 'user permissions such as comment, edit, delete, and administration rights.' None of these nodes relate to notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses configuring blocked attachment mimetypes and programming rights and permissions, which are irrelevant to the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to address several key points mentioned in the factual alignments, such as the configuration of blocked attachment mimetypes, specific rights (programming, register, create wikis, script, comment, edit, delete), and their respective settings in XWiki. There are no contradictions, but the omissions lead to a high hallucination score."
