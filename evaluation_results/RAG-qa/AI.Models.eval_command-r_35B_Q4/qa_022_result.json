  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the output is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes a link to XWiki syntax documentation, which is not pertinent to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the third rank mentions that 'The extension status can be toggled by editing the configuration variable \"notifications.enabled\" in xwiki.properties and restarting the server,' which is directly relevant to enabling notifications. However, irrelevant nodes in the first, second, and fourth ranks discuss various notification-related macros, changes in email content, and email notification settings, which are not directly relevant to enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only the first sentence of the expected output is supported by the 3rd node in the retrieval context, while the rest of the sentences lack corresponding information in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses notification settings and macros in XWiki, but does not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and the contradictions indicate that the actual output consistently agrees with the provided context, showing no signs of hallucination."
