  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses user authentication with access tokens, but includes an irrelevant URL that does not pertain to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node providing 'detailed information about the JWT token requirements' is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes about 'blocking attachment mimetypes' and 'creating custom authentication using a Groovy script' are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a perfect match.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses attachment mimetype restrictions and custom authentication methods in XWiki, which do not address the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output lacks specific details about creating custom authentication using a Groovy script, which is a key aspect mentioned in the context. However, it aligns with other provided contexts regarding JWT token generation and attachment validation."
