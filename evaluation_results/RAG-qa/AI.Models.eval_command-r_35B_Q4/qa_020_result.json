  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.44 because multiple irrelevant statements were made, such as providing URLs that do not directly address the specific configuration question and indicating a lack of detailed information without offering a solution. However, the score is not lower because there is some attempt to address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides general information about XWiki and its use cases but does not address specific configuration steps for access control. The second node describes the features of first and second generation wikis, including rights management, but does not provide specific steps on how to configure access control for teams. The third node explains what a wiki is and its advantages, but it does not provide any information on configuring access control in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about XWiki and wikis, but it does not address the specific configuration question about team access and editing rights.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with the context provided, which discusses various aspects of wikis, while the actual output focuses solely on setting access rights without addressing the introductory information, features of first and second generation wikis, or the advantages of wikis over traditional CMS."
