  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the customization of user profile fields in XWiki with OpenID Connect. However, it includes a link about Scalability and Performance, which is not relevant to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node should be ranked lower as it discusses 'authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration,' which is not relevant to customizing user profile fields. The second node should be ranked lower as it provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and links to configuration guides,' but does not address mapping additional user profile fields. The third node should be ranked lower as it discusses 'XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities,' which are not relevant to the customization of user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and clustering capabilities, which are unrelated to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output aligns with the context regarding OpenID Connect configuration but misses crucial details about Java/Java EE, multi-tenancy, and clustering in XWiki."
