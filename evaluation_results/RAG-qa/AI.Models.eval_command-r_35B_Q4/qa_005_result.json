  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are not directly relevant to configuring automatic user enablement upon first login using OpenID Connect. However, the score is not zero because there may be some partial relevance or context provided.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'domain-based instance configuration and session cookie settings,' which are not related to enabling user accounts on first login using OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator,' but does not address the specific configuration needed. The third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' which is also not relevant to the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be directly attributed to any specific part of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based instance configuration, session cookie settings, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently does not align with the provided context. The context is about configuring XWiki for domain-based instances, bypassing OpenID Connect, prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, and configuration guides for OpenID Connect Authenticator, while the actual output incorrectly discusses enabling user accounts created via OpenID Connect."
