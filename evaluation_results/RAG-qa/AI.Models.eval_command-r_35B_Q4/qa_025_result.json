  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response is mostly relevant and addresses the main issue of configuring automatic user account activation in XWiki using OpenID Connect. However, it includes a general statement about configuration guides that does not directly address the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output suggests adjusting configuration settings in the xwiki.cfg file, but the retrieval context states that the OIDC authenticator does not rely on the property xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains in xwiki.cfg.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the third rank mentions that the xwiki.properties file is the one to be adjusted for OpenID Connect configurations. However, irrelevant nodes in the first, second, and fourth ranks provide general information, discuss domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration, and list dependencies, which do not address the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the relevance of the xwiki.properties file for OpenID Connect configuration is mentioned (node 2 in retrieval context), but specific details about property updates, uncommenting, saving, restarting, and automatic activation of new user accounts are missing.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific issue of automatically activating user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and all mentioned points in the actual output are consistent with the provided context."
