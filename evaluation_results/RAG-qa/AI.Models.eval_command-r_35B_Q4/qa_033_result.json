  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the core information about authenticating users with access tokens is provided, but the inclusion of unrelated URLs and an off-topic question slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.79 because the actual output contains several contradictions: it incorrectly specifies the format for the 'Authorization' header, misinterprets the 'iss' claim as the URL of the property instead of the issuer, incorrectly describes the 'sub' claim as deriving the username instead of the subject, and inaccurately details the 'aud' claim as excluding the path in the URL of the XWiki installation.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the first node discusses form utilization on XWiki.org, which is not relevant to authenticating users with access tokens, but is ranked higher than the second node that provides detailed information on JWT tokens, which is directly relevant. Additionally, the third node discusses features and extensions for XWiki, which are also not relevant to the topic but are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.86 because most of the expected output is well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, particularly regarding the use of JWT tokens, their requirements, and the configuration steps. However, the limitation of the authenticator to only create or update users based on token information is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses form utilization, menu applications, and notifications on XWiki.org, which are irrelevant to the topic of authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output discusses token-based authentication, which is unrelated to the provided context about the Reference Form, Questionnaire Form, Menu application, Notifications, Invitation, and other features. This indicates a significant misalignment with the context, leading to a higher hallucination score."
