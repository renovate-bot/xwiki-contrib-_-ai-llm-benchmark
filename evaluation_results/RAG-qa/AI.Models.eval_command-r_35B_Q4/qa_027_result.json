  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes an irrelevant URL about scalability and performance, which slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first node discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities, and the second node covers domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, both of which are not relevant to configuring group synchronization with an OpenID Connect provider. The relevant node, which mentions the OpenID Connect Authenticator and provides links to configuration guides, is ranked third.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering capabilities, domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and general OpenID Connect integration, none of which are relevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information about XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering features, domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, and OpenID Connect Authenticator prerequisites, installation, dependencies, and configuration guides."
