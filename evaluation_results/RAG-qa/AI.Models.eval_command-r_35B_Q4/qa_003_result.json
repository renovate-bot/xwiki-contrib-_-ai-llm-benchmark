  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, it includes irrelevant statements such as a URL and the phrase 'That's odd.' which do not contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node 'provides links to various notification-related macros but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.' The second node 'lists various ways to be notified in XWiki but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions.' The third node 'discusses email notifications and their configurations but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially aligns with the expected output, specifically regarding the ability to edit notification settings, but it does not mention the default behavior of not receiving notifications about one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various notification-related features in XWiki but does not specifically address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output partially aligns with the context by mentioning several notification methods and customization options, but it fails to mention specific notification macros listed in the context."
