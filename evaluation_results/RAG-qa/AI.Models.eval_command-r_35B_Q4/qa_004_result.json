  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information, but the inclusion of a link about XWiki syntax slightly detracts from its focus on managing notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly claims that System Filters are related to specific roles or categories like 'All Pages' or 'Space Administrator,' which are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) that explains managing notifications is ranked lower than two irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses filter types and management, and the second node lists notification preferences macros, neither of which directly address disabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while nodes in the retrieval context mention custom notification filters and notifications about changes, they do not mention 'Automatic page watching' or changing this setting in the user profile.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is perfectly relevant and there are no reasons for irrelevancy. Great job!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output contains detailed information that aligns well with the context, despite the listed contradictions. The contradictions actually highlight consistent information between the actual output and the context, indicating no hallucination."
