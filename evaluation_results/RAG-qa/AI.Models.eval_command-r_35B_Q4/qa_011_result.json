  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the issue with the 'Alert Notification' extension and the bell icon, but includes an irrelevant link to the XWiki Syntax documentation.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions that 'The extension status can be toggled by editing the configuration variable \"notifications.enabled\" in xwiki.properties and restarting the server,' is ranked third. The first node discusses 'details of changes in email notifications and user profile settings,' and the second node talks about 'getting a notification RSS feed and the settings for notifications,' both of which are irrelevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses email notifications, user profile settings, and macros in a wiki application, but it does not address the issue of the bell icon not being available even with the 'Alert Notification' extension installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output fails to mention key elements such as the notification RSS feed and various notification macros, which are the primary focus of the context. Additionally, there is a contradiction regarding the extension status toggle, which further contributes to the hallucination score."
