  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes references to a URL and a statement about documentation that do not directly address the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly claims that administrators have the 'ADMIN' permission without mentioning that programming rights imply ADMIN rights, and it also incorrectly states that the main wiki administrator has implicit scripting permission, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.14 because the relevant node (rank 7) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'programming rights, which are not relevant to denying script rights to a space administrator,' and the second node discusses 'color themes and access for unregistered users, which is not relevant to the question about script rights for a space administrator.' These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output with clear and relevant information.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various rights and functionalities unrelated to denying script rights to a space administrator, such as 'Color Themes', 'icon fonts', and 'Forgot Username and Forgot Password functionality'.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output failed to mention several critical elements such as 'programming rights', 'Color Themes', 'comment rights', 'edit rights', 'delete rights', and 'special permissions', which were expected based on the context."
