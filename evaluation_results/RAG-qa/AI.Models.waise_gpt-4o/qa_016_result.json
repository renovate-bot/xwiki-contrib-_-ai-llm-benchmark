    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant and mostly addresses the input query, but it includes a generic statement that lacks specific information directly related to customizing user profile fields in XWiki from an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, including installation instructions and dependencies,' but does not address customization of user profile fields. Similarly, the second node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' which is not relevant to the customization of user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are accurately attributed to nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
