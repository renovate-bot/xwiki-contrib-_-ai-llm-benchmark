    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first three nodes are irrelevant as they either provide general information, list dependencies, or discuss prerequisites without addressing user profile field customization. However, the fourth and fifth nodes are directly relevant, mentioning the `xwiki.properties` file and listing variables for user profile mapping, which should have been ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are accurately supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
