  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, including prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies. The second node mentions general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, such as the type, category, developer, and compatibility. The third node lists dependencies required for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension. The fourth node lists various endpoints, customization options, and troubleshooting tips for the OpenID Connect Authenticator. None of these nodes contain information about configuring automatic user activation on first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context provides information about the `xwiki.properties` file and its configuration for OpenID Connect, it does not explicitly mention saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, or ensuring new user accounts are automatically activated on first login."
