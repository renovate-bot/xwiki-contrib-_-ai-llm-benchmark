  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.97 because the answer is highly relevant and almost entirely focused on configuring OpenID Connect authentication in XWiki. However, there is a minor irrelevant mention of LDAP authentication, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly instructs to set `xwiki.authentication.createuser=1` in the `xwiki.cfg` file, while the retrieval context states it should be set to `empty`.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'container authentication and various authentication methods' but does not mention the specific configuration needed. The second node provides information about 'OpenID Connect authentication and its installation' but does not address the specific configuration needed. The third node focuses on 'LDAP authentication and its configuration,' which is unrelated. The fourth node discusses 'in-wiki configuration for OIDC authenticator and the use of multiple configurations through cookies,' but it does not provide the specific setting needed. The fifth node provides a 'general overview of different authentication mechanisms,' but does not mention the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all the instructions and details in the expected output are clearly supported by the information provided in the nodes in the retrieval context."
