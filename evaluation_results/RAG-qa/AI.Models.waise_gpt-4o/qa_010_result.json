    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.95 because the actual output incorrectly claims that explicitly denying the 'Edit' right ensures it is not inherited, while the retrieval context clarifies that explicit denial does not block inheritance for the denied right in XWiki.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because while the relevant nodes are mostly ranked higher, some irrelevant nodes are still ranked above relevant ones. For example, the second node, which 'does not provide information on setting access rights or permissions', is ranked higher than the third node, which 'covers the basic rules of setting permissions in XWiki'. Additionally, the fourth node, which 'is not relevant to setting access rights for teams', is ranked higher than some relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while the retrieval context nodes mention creating groups, setting wiki-wide and space-level rights, and adjusting rights, they do not explicitly mention the specific outcomes listed in the expected output."
