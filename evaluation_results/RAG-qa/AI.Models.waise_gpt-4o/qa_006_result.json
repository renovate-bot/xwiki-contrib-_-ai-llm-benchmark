  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because while the answer does provide some information related to customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki, it includes multiple irrelevant example values that do not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "Great job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in retrieval context, which 'lists various OpenID Connect user properties', is relevant and ranked correctly. However, the first node, which 'discusses group synchronization and customization templates', is irrelevant and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third, fourth, and fifth nodes are also irrelevant as they do not address user profile field mapping or the `oidc.user.mapping` property, and should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because the retrieval context aligns well with the customization and mapping instructions but lacks specific example details and final steps."
