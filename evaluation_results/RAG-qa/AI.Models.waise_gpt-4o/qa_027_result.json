  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job ensuring the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes are relevant and ranked correctly, providing details on adding the claim `xwiki_groups` and configuring the `oidc.groups.mapping` property respectively. However, the second, fourth, and fifth nodes, which are less relevant as they discuss prerequisites, dependencies, and general descriptions, are not ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
