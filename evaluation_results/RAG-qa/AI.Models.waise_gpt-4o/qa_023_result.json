  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the main part of the answer addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, it includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question, which slightly reduces the relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in retrieval context, which provides information about default notification settings for users, is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node which lists various sections and links related to the Notifications Application, and the second node which describes different types of notification preferences macros, are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a perfect match."
