  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the main question about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes an irrelevant statement about the LDAP Authenticator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly states 'xwiki.authentication.createuser=1' for activating automatic user creation, whereas the retrieval context specifies it should be 'xwiki.authentication.createuser=empty'.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. For example, the first node provides general information about prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not mention the specific configuration needed to enable user accounts automatically. Additionally, the third node discusses connecting XWiki with Active Directory and LDAP configuration, which is unrelated to the specific OpenID Connect configuration needed for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while some nodes in the retrieval context mention related concepts like 'xwiki.cfg' and 'automatic synchronization,' they do not provide the specific instructions or details found in the expected output."
