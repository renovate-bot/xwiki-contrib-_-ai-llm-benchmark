    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node describes the notifications feature and its visual representation but does not address the issue of the 'Bell' not appearing or how to enable notifications. The second node provides metadata about the notifications feature, including its type, category, and developer, but it does not address the problem of the 'Bell' not appearing or how to enable notifications. The third node provides a list of features and extensions that can be added to the wiki but does not address the issue of the 'Bell' not appearing or how to enable notifications. The fourth node lists dependencies for the notifications extension but does not address the issue of the 'Bell' not appearing or how to enable notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications, the `notifications.enabled` setting, or the `xwiki.properties` file."
