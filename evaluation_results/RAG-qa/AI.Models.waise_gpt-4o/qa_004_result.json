    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "Fantastic job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which mentions that administrators can change users' notification settings and discusses the default auto-watched mode, is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing image links, clearing notifications, and grouping notifications, and the second node discussing enabling and disabling email notifications via configuration files and server settings, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 4th node in the retrieval context supports the information about setting the default auto watching page behavior (related to sentence 3 in the expected output), there are no nodes in the retrieval context that mention being notified about changes on your work or deleting existing notification filters (related to sentences 1 and 4 in the expected output)."
