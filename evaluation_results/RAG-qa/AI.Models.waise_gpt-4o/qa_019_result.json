    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but includes several irrelevant links that do not directly address the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and consistency!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'form validation', the second node contains 'references to various images and links', the third node discusses 'templates and page creation', the fourth node also contains 'references to various images and links', and the fifth node contains 'code snippets for custom right checks', none of which address the question about denying script rights to an administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention that certain rights implied by admin rights cannot be denied in XWiki."
