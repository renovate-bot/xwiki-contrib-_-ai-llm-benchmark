    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response was perfectly relevant and directly addressed the issue without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides links and descriptions related to the Notifications Application but does not address the issue of the notification bell not being available. The second node lists dependencies for the notifications extension without providing information on enabling notifications. The third node explains how to get a notification RSS feed but does not address the notification bell issue. The fourth node discusses additional settings and customization options without mentioning enabling notifications. The fifth node describes the notifications menu but does not provide information on enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially supports the expected output, but it does not mention how to enable notifications by defining `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`."
