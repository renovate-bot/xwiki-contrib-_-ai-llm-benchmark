  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because while some relevant information is provided, there are multiple irrelevant statements that do not directly address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output claims that the configuration predeterminada de visualizaci\u00f3n autom\u00e1tica can be adjusted in the archivo `xwiki.properties`, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'how to get a notification RSS feed' and does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The second node lists 'various notification preferences macros' but does not provide information on enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node discusses 'different notification email settings and filters' but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. The fourth node explains 'how to override default notification templates and install extensions' but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. The fifth node provides 'information for administrators on configuring notifications for all users' but does not address how an individual user can enable notifications for their own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context supports the idea of managing notification settings (sentence 2), it does not cover the concept that users don't receive notifications about their own activity unless explicitly targeted (sentence 1)."
