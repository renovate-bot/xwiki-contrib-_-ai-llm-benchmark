  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and addresses the issue well, but the inclusion of an image link that doesn't provide additional useful information slightly detracts from the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in retrieval context are irrelevant. For instance, the first node discusses the alert menu and how notifications are displayed, but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and configuring settings in the xwiki.properties file (supporting sentence 1), it does not explicitly mention setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` (unsupportive for sentence 2)."
