  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and provides useful information, but the statement 'Attachment Validation Application.' is vague and does not add value to the answer.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which provides 'detailed steps for setting the maximum size of an attachment', is correctly ranked high. However, the first node, which 'mentions setting limits on attachment size but does not provide specific steps or mention mimetype restrictions', should be ranked lower than the second node. Additionally, nodes ranked third to sixth, which discuss 'forcing certain attachment mime-types to be downloaded', 'attachment versioning and storage', 'validating attachments using JavaScript and installation instructions for an extension', and 'adding attachments using the top-level menu, attachment tab, and WYSIWYG editor', are not relevant and should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all the steps and details in the expected output are accurately supported by the information provided in the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
