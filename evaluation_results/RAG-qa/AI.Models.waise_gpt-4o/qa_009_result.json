    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question of how to deny script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.95 because the actual output incorrectly states that space administrators have the 'Script' right by default, contradicting the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node 'describes the Script right and its availability but does not address whether script rights can be denied to a space administrator.' The second node 'discusses the technicalities of checking access rights in code but does not provide information on denying script rights to a space administrator.' The third node 'is about converting rights when moving pages and does not relate to denying script rights to a space administrator.' The fourth node 'advises on using the checkAccess() method for security but does not discuss denying script rights to a space administrator.' The fifth node 'lists various rights and their properties, but it does not specifically address the ability to deny script rights to a space administrator.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
