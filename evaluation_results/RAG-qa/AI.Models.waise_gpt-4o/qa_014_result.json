    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because the answer includes several irrelevant URL links that do not directly address how to disable notifications. However, the score is not lower because the core response still provides some relevant information about disabling notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are about topics such as customizing page templates, adding menus, modifying CSS files, keyboard shortcuts, applications and extensions, configuring editors, and authorized applications, none of which are relevant to disabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context."
