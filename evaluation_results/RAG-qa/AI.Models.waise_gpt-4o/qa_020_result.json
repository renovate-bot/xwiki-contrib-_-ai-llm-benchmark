    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer provides relevant information on configuring user permissions in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific query about team-specific permissions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node in retrieval context (second node) is ranked lower than the irrelevant node in retrieval context (first node). The first node discusses 'REST API implementation in XWiki', which is not relevant, while the second node includes 'an image related to managing groups in XWiki', which is relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context."
