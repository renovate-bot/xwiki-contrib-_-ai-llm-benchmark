  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the output provides useful information on configuring upload restrictions for images and PDFs, but includes URLs that are not directly relevant to the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node in the second rank provides specific steps for setting the maximum size of an attachment in XWiki, which is highly relevant. However, irrelevant nodes in the first, third, fourth, and fifth ranks discuss topics such as links to documentation sections, document lifecycle features, storage options, and macros, none of which address MIME type restrictions or size limits for attachments.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.73 because while many instructions in the expected output match the steps provided in the nodes in the retrieval context, several introductory and step-introducing sentences do not have direct equivalents."
