  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the response contains several irrelevant links that do not address the specific question about enabling notifications for own actions in XWiki. However, the score is not lower because the main content likely provided some relevant information on the topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "Fantastic job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node should be ranked lower as it describes 'the configuration of authorized applications,' which is unrelated to notifications about one's own activity. Similarly, the second node should be ranked lower as it provides information on 'customizing page templates, internationalization, and accessibility,' none of which are relevant to enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node should also be ranked lower since it lists 'various extensions and features like Office Importer, Font Awesome Icon Theme, and Syntax Highlighting,' which are not relevant. The fourth node describes 'different page editing modes and features,' and the fifth node provides details about the 'Model Validation UI,' both of which do not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context."
