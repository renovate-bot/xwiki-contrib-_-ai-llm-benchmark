    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides specific information on group synchronization (ranked 4th), is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node mainly provides general information about the OpenID Connect extension and does not provide specific steps for configuring group synchronization, the second node lists dependencies required for the OpenID Connect authenticator extension but lacks relevant information, and the third node includes endpoints and customization options but not the specific steps needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports all sentences in the expected output, especially with the 5th node in the retrieval context covering all necessary details."
