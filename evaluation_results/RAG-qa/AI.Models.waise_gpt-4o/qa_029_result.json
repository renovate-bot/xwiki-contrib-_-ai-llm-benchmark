    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher, ensuring that the most pertinent information is prioritized. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the information provided in the retrieval context. Great job!"
