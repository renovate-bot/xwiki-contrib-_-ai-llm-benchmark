  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because while the answer partially addresses the question, it includes irrelevant statements about the lack of specific information and general limitations in knowledge, which do not directly help in solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.60 because the actual output incorrectly states that the provided text contains specific information about XWiki's security modules and instructions for managing user permissions, which are not present in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and its configuration, which does not address the question. The second node talks about registering and unregistering custom rights, which is also unrelated. The third node explains various rights but does not provide information on denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses AuthorizationSettler and various rights but does not address how to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to address the specific details provided in the context about the AuthorizationSettler, Right definitions, configuration options, the process of registering/unregistering rights, and the specific rights and their configurations. There are no contradictions, but the lack of alignment with the provided context results in a high hallucination score."
