  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer provides relevant information about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question, slightly lowering the relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the first rank provides detailed information on JWT token generation, which is crucial for authenticating users with access tokens. The irrelevant nodes about document management (second node) and cookie protection levels (third node) are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the 1st node in the retrieval context, many specific steps and details are missing in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses API endpoints and various authentication strategies but does not mention access token authentication.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks critical information about document operations in collections and security measures for 'remember me' cookies, IP address usage, and authentication strategies, which are essential parts of the provided contexts."
