  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, providing information on configuring the 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.mapping' properties, which are essential for group synchronization. However, the second node discusses domain-based authentication and session cookies, which is not relevant to the group synchronization process and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.77 because while the retrieval context covers most of the configuration steps for group synchronization (nodes 1 and 3), it misses key instructions such as locating, opening, and saving the 'xwiki.properties' file, as well as restarting XWiki (sentences 1, 2, and the last sentence).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the context discusses domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, which are not related to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.33 because the actual output aligns with the context in providing steps for group synchronization but lacks details on configuring session cookies for domain-based instances and bypassing OpenID Connect, indicating partial but not complete accuracy."
