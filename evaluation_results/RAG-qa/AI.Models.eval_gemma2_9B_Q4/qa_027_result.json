  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes a URL about scalability and performance, which is not relevant to the question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly states that connection parameters need to be configured in `xwiki.cfg`, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that the OIDC authenticator does not rely on the property xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains in xwiki.cfg.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering, which does not relate to configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The second node focuses on domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, which is also unrelated. The third node mentions OpenID Connect but lacks specific steps or details on configuring group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering capabilities, and domain-based authentication, which are irrelevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output misses key aspects such as multi-tenancy, clustering features, domain-based instance authentication, and session cookie configuration, which are crucial according to the provided context. However, it correctly discusses the 'OpenID Connect Authenticator' extension."
