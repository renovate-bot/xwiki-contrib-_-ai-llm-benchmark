  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the response provides useful information on configuring access control in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant URLs and general statements that do not directly address the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.62 because the actual output incorrectly states that the notion of space has been removed from the UI and that XWiki plans to discard the concept of spaces to only keep pages.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics such as 'creation of spaces and sub-pages', 'executing a migration plan', and 'XAR export process' which are unrelated to configuring team-specific access control. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like space management, migration plans, and XAR export in XWiki, which are irrelevant to configuring team permissions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical details mentioned in the context, such as the creation and management of pages and spaces in XWiki, the execution of migration plans, and the XAR export process, leading to a complete misalignment with the provided context."
