  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is completely relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.78 because the actual output incorrectly states that script rights can be refused by modifying the administrator's rights at the main wiki level and by disabling a 'Programming Right' checkbox, which are not mentioned in the retrieval context. The retrieval context specifies that programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page or the main wiki in a multi-wiki environment.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions that 'programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page' and implies these rights include SCRIPT, is ranked third. The first node discusses Color Themes, icon fonts, and access rights, and the second node explains various rights like comment, edit, delete, and administration, but neither addresses refusing script rights to an administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses Color Themes, icon fonts, and general access rights management, but does not provide specific instructions on how to refuse script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output provides instructions on modifying programming rights, which is not mentioned or related to any of the contexts provided. The contexts discuss Color Themes, icon fonts, access rights for unregistered users, comment, edit, delete, administration rights, and programming, register, and create wikis rights. This indicates a complete mismatch between the actual output and the contexts, resulting in a high hallucination score."
