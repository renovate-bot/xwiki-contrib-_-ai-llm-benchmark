  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly claims the use of the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node that mentions the `oidc.user.mapping` property and provides an example of how to map custom properties is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes discussing domain-based authentication, session cookies, group synchronization, and customization templates are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.83 because most of the content in the expected output is supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, except for the instruction to save the xwiki.properties file and restart XWiki, which is not mentioned.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses authentication configurations and group synchronization, which do not address mapping additional user profile fields.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks critical details about authentication with a domain-based instance, session cookies configuration, group synchronization, custom templates, listeners, and troubleshooting, which are essential to the context. However, it correctly mentions the use of the `oidc.user.mapping` property, indicating partial alignment."
