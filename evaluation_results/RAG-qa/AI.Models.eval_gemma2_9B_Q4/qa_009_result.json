  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output incorrectly claims that administrators have broad permissions by default, whereas the retrieval context specifies that the administration right's default status is denied.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'Programming Right' but does not address denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node talks about 'Color Themes' and related access issues, which are not relevant. The third node explains 'Comment Right' and 'Edit Right', but does not provide information on denying script rights. The fourth node describes 'Delete Right' and 'Special Permissions', including 'Administration Right', but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various rights in a wiki environment, Color Themes, and icon fonts, which are irrelevant to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to provide specific steps required to deny script rights to a space administrator, instead offering general documentation links, which does not align with the necessary detailed instructions."
