  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.62 because the answer contains several irrelevant statements, such as a URL related to XWiki Syntax and general offers for further assistance, which do not directly address the specific question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, the score is not lower because some relevant information is still provided.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context that are ranked first, second, and third all discuss different aspects of notifications in XWiki, such as 'various notification macros', 'different ways to receive notifications', and 'how to receive notifications via email and configure email notification settings', but none of them address the specific issue of enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions in XWiki, focusing instead on general notification settings and preferences.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently does not agree with the provided context, discussing a different topic (receiving notifications about one's own activity) than what is described in the context (various notification methods and configurations in XWiki)."
