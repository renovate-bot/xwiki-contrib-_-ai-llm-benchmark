  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki, but the link to XWikiSyntax documentation is not pertinent to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output incorrectly states that you can access your notification preferences through the Alert icon in the top bar, whereas the retrieval context only mentions receiving notifications under the Alert entry.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node 'describes the What's New Application' and does not provide information on enabling notifications. The second node 'lists various notification-related macros' but does not explain how to enable notifications. The third node 'describes different ways to receive notifications' but does not provide instructions on enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.14 because only the instruction about receiving notifications via the bell icon in the alert menu (sentence 4) is supported by the 2nd node in the retrieval context, while other instructions are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the context only provides information about the 'What's New Application' in XWiki, which does not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output omits specific details mentioned in the context, such as the What's New Application and various notification preferences macros, despite generally aligning with the context on the broader topic of notifications in XWiki."
