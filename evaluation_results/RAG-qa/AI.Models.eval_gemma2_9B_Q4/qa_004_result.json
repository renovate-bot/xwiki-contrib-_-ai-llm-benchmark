  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the main concern about disabling notifications in XWiki. However, the inclusion of a link about XWiki Syntax, which is not directly related to managing notifications, slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and ranked correctly. However, the second node, which 'lists various notification preferences macros without providing specific information on how to disable notifications,' is irrelevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only the last sentence of the expected output is supported by the retrieval context, specifically by the 1st node in the retrieval context. The rest of the sentences are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is perfectly relevant and there are no reasons for irrelevancy. Great job!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and all provided contradictions indicate that the actual output is consistent with the context."
