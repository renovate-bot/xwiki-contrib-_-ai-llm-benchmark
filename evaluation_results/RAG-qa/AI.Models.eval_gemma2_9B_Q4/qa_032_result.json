  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes a link about attachment validation UI, which is not directly related.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node providing detailed information on the generation of JWT tokens is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes about blocked attachment mimetypes and creating custom authentication using a Groovy script are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses attachment mimetype restrictions and custom authentication methods in XWiki, which do not address the specific question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output lacks critical information about blocked attachment mimetypes and custom authentication using a Groovy script, which are key focuses of the provided contexts. This indicates a significant level of hallucination."
