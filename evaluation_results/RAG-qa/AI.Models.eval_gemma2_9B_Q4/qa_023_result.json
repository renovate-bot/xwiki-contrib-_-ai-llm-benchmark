  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer mostly addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but includes irrelevant statements such as a link to XWiki syntax documentation and a general suggestion without specific content.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses notification preferences macros, the second node talks about email notifications configuration, and the third node explains filtering of notifications. None of these nodes address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output, with relevant nodes confirming the filtering of notifications and the specific mention of advanced filtering options.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions, focusing instead on general notification settings and technical details.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to include several specific details mentioned in the context, such as macros, email notification settings, and filtering modes, which indicates a high level of hallucination."
