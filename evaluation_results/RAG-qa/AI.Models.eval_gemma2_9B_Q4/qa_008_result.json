  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that entering 'image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif,application/pdf' in the 'Blocked Mimetypes' field will allow only these file types to be uploaded, whereas the retrieval context states that any attachment matching one of the listed mimetypes will be rejected if the list is not empty.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node, which is ranked highest, is irrelevant as it 'does not address configuring allowed mimetypes or setting maximum attachment size.' However, the second and third nodes are relevant as they provide information on 'blocking attachment mimetypes' and 'setting the maximum size of an attachment,' respectively.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while the retrieval context nodes mention configuring mimetype restrictions (node 2) and setting maximum attachment size (node 3), they do not provide specific steps to ensure only images or PDF files can be uploaded or detailed instructions for configuring allowed mimetypes and maximum attachment size.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses attachment methods and mimetype restrictions but does not address file type and size limits.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the context, and the actual output aligns with the context regarding the use of menus, attachment tabs, WYSIWYG editor, blocked attachment mimetypes, and configuration through the administration UI."
