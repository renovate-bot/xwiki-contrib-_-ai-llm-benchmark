  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the main response addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own activity, but it includes irrelevant URLs and an unnecessary statement about access to personal settings.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are unrelated to the input. The first node discusses 'authorization settler components and access decisions,' the second node is about 'configuring blocked attachment mimetypes,' and the third node focuses on the 'checkAccess() method for access control,' none of which pertain to notifications for user actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like AuthorizationSettler, mimetype restrictions, and access violations, which are unrelated to the user's query about enabling notifications for their own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical details mentioned in the factual alignments, such as information about the AuthorizationSettler, blocked attachment mimetypes, the administration UI, and the checkAccess() method. There are no contradictions, but the absence of these key details leads to a high hallucination score."
