  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'domain-based instances and session cookie configuration', the second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and links to various configuration guides', and the third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension'. None of these address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts on first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention automatically activating user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect, nor does it include any instructions related to the `xwiki.properties` file, the specific property `oidc.enableUser`, or the steps to save and restart the XWiki instance.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based instance configuration, session cookie settings, and bypassing OpenID Connect, none of which address the automatic activation of user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output omits crucial information about configuring the session cookie for automatic authentication in a domain-based instance, prerequisites, installation instructions, and specific dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator."
