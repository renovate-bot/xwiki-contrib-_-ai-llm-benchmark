  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.57 because the actual output includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about disabling notifications. However, the score is not lower because there might still be some relevant information present in the output.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'blocked attachment mimetypes', the second node explains 'setting the default language for a wiki page', and the third node is about 'directory cleanup and database attachment storage in XWiki', none of which relate to disabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses blocked attachment mimetypes, default language settings in a wiki editor, and directory cleanup in XWiki, which are all irrelevant to the input about disabling notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output provides information about managing notifications in XWiki, which does not align with the contexts provided. The contexts require information on defining blocked attachment mimetypes, setting the default language for a page, and directory cleanup and database attachment store settings, none of which are addressed in the actual output."
