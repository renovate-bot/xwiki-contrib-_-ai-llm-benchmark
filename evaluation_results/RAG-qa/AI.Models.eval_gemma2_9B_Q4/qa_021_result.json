  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue with the notification bell, but it includes unrelated documentation links that do not address the specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node 'provides links and descriptions of various XWiki extensions and features, but does not address the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki settings.' The second node 'lists various notification preferences and macros but does not provide information on enabling notifications in the wiki settings.' The third node 'discusses how to follow a user and default watch settings, but it does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions notifications and preferences, it does not provide specific details about setting the `notifications.enabled` property in `xwiki.properties` as described in the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context includes irrelevant information such as '[Menu](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Menu%20Application)' and 'Other features can be added to your wiki by [installing](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Extension%20Manager%20Application) extensions not listed above.' which are not related to the availability of the notification bell.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks significant information mentioned in the context, including details about the Menu application, Invitation application, notification preferences, macros, following a user, default watch settings, and related images and tabs. There are no contradictions, but the omissions lead to a high hallucination score."
