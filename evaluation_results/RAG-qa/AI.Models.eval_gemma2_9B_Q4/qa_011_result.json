  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the issue of the notification bell icon not appearing, but it includes an unnecessary link to XWiki syntax documentation.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first two nodes discuss 'details of changes displayed in email content and user profile settings' and 'getting a notification RSS feed and the Notifications Macro,' which are not relevant to enabling notifications in the wiki, but are ranked higher than the third node, which directly relates to enabling notifications by mentioning 'editing the configuration variable \"notifications.enabled\" in xwiki.properties and restarting the server.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output, with relevant nodes providing necessary details.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses notification settings and macros in XWiki, which does not address the issue of 'Die Glocke oben rechts ist nicht verf\u00fcgbar, auch nicht wenn die Erweiterung 'Alert Notification' installiert ist.'",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks alignment with the context in multiple areas, including details about changes, macros for settings, enabling/disabling the extension, notification RSS feed, and notification macros, without any contradictions."
