  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question well, but the inclusion of a URL to the XWiki RESTful API documentation slightly detracts from the focus on configuring upload settings for images or PDF files.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'HTTP methods and media types for retrieving page history and children', which does not relate to configuring MIME types or attachment sizes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses HTTP endpoints and operations, which are unrelated to the input question about restricting file uploads by type and size.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks essential details about the HTTP methods, media types, descriptions, and status codes for the specified endpoints, as highlighted in the factual alignments. There are no contradictions, but the absence of these critical details results in a high hallucination score."
