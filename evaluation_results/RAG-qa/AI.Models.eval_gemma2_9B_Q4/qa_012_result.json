  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains multiple irrelevant URLs and statements that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'attachment mimetype restrictions' which does not relate to notifications or their settings, the second node is about 'programming rights and permissions within a wiki,' and the third node explains 'various user rights such as comment, edit, delete, and administration rights,' all of which are unrelated to the issue of receiving notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses configuring blocked attachment mimetypes and user permissions, which are irrelevant to the issue of not receiving notifications ('Ich erhalte keine Benachrichtigungen').",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output does not align well with the context, missing relevant information about programming rights, permissions hierarchy, and specific rights configurations, despite providing a relevant link to attachment restrictions."
