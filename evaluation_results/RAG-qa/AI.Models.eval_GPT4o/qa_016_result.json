  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the majority of the response is relevant to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider, but there are a couple of statements about scalability, performance, and database support features of XWiki that are not directly related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration', which does not pertain to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider. Similarly, the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator' without addressing the customization of user profile fields. The third node explains 'XWiki's scalability and multi-tenancy capabilities', which are unrelated to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like domain-based authentication, session cookies, and XWiki's scalability, which are not related to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently focuses on customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider and omits multiple specific details and topics mentioned in the contexts, indicating a high level of hallucination."
