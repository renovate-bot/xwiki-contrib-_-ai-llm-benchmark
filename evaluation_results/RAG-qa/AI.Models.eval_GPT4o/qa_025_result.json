    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (4th node) mentioning the xwiki.properties file and the oidc.skipped property is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, which is not specific to the configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts on first login. Similarly, the second node discusses domain-based instance configuration and session cookies, which is unrelated to the input question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because although there is a mention of adjusting the xwiki.properties file (node 5 in retrieval context), there are no specific details about adding or updating properties, setting `oidc.enableUser` to `true`, saving the file, restarting XWiki, or automatic activation of new user accounts.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific issue of automatically activating user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect, instead providing general information and unrelated details.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating no hallucination."
