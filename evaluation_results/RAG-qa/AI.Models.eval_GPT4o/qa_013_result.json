  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because while the response provides some relevant information, it includes multiple irrelevant links that do not address the specific question about enabling notifications for own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node (rank 5) that addresses 'Notifications Custom Filters Preferences' and 'Notifications Filters Preferences' is ranked lower than four irrelevant nodes. The irrelevant nodes (ranks 1-4) discuss topics like 'various applications and features,' 'AuthorizationSettler and access decisions,' 'blocked attachment mimetypes,' and 'checkAccess() method for access control,' which are not related to enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context supports the part about custom notification filters in the user profile (6th node in retrieval context), but it does not mention anything about receiving notifications about one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses unrelated topics such as 'Menu application', 'AuthorizationSettler', and 'blocked attachment mimetypes', which do not address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details and does not align with the provided contexts, as indicated by the factual alignments. There are no contradictions, but the absence of critical information results in a high hallucination score."
