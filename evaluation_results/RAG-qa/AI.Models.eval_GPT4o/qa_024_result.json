  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses how to disable notifications, but it includes a link that does not directly relate to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which discusses 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences' and 'Notifications Custom Filters Preferences,' is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes, such as those focusing on email notifications, RSS feeds, and page structures, are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not provide specific instructions on how to disable notifications, which is the main concern of the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions indicating that the actual output does not align with the provided context."
