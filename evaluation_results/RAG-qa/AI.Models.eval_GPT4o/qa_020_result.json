  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because while the answer provides some relevant information, it includes multiple URLs that do not directly address the specific question about configuring permissions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is a general introduction to XWiki and its use cases, but it does not provide specific instructions on configuring access controls for teams. The second node explains features of first and second generation wikis, including rights management, but lacks the detailed steps required for team-specific access controls in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.62 because while several key steps (sentences 1-4) in the expected output align well with nodes in the retrieval context, the introductory and concluding sentences do not directly correlate with any specific part of the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about XWiki but does not address the specific configuration question.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.60 because the actual output misses several key points from the context, such as information about first and second generation wikis, XWiki's relational database and programming features, and the basic features and advantages of using a wiki. However, it does correctly address configuring rights and managing user rights in XWiki."
