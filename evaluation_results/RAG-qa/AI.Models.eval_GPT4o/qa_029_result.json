  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question, but it includes a URL that does not directly provide the steps or information needed to refuse script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.55 because the actual output incorrectly states that script rights are included in administration rights by default, while the retrieval context specifies that programming rights (including script rights) must be granted explicitly. Additionally, the actual output suggests methods to deny script rights to an administrator, which the retrieval context does not support.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which states 'the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page,' is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes discussing 'Color Themes, icon fonts, and access rights' (rank 1) and 'various rights such as comment, edit, and delete' (rank 2) should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly aligns with the expected output, with relevant nodes supporting the statements made.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context primarily discusses Color Themes, icon fonts, and general access rights management in XWiki, which are irrelevant to the input query about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.20 because the actual output aligns well with the context in terms of managing access rights, specific rights like script rights, and providing relevant documentation links. However, it misses mentioning implied rights and inheritance, which are noted as necessary corrections."
