  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the main content is relevant to configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect, but there are several URLs provided that are unrelated to this specific topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, which is ranked 4th, is preceded by three irrelevant nodes. These irrelevant nodes discuss topics such as XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering (1st node), authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration (2nd node), and configuring OpenOffice server settings in XWiki (3rd node), which should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering capabilities, domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and OpenOffice server configuration, none of which address the process of synchronizing groups with an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output fails to mention several key details from the context, such as XWiki being written in Java/Java EE, multi-tenancy, clustering, domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, OpenOffice server instance details, and database support. However, it does correctly provide a relevant link to the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension."
