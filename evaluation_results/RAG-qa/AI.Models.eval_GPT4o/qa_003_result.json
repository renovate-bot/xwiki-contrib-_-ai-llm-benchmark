    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes links to XWiki syntax and general features documentation, which are not directly related to enabling notifications for own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'lists various notification-related macros and their descriptions but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions in XWiki, instead providing unrelated information about various notification-related macros and applications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating no hallucinations."
