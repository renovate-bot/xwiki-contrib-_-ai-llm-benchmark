  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about restricting file uploads, but it includes links to the XWiki RESTful API and Version Control documentation, which are not directly relevant to the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring MIME types or attachment sizes. For example, the first node describes 'HTTP methods and media types for retrieving page history and children,' which does not address the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention any of the steps or configurations related to ensuring only images or PDFs with a maximum size of 10 MB can be uploaded.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides information about API endpoints, page translations, versioning, and managing wikis, none of which address how to ensure that only images or PDF files with a maximum size of 10 MB can be uploaded as attachments.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently fails to include specific details mentioned in the context, such as endpoints, methods, page versioning system, and history features, indicating a high level of hallucination."
