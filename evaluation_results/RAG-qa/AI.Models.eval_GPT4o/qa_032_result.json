  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes URLs that do not directly address the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which provides detailed information about the JWT token requirements and the claims it must contain, is ranked first. All irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing blocked attachment mimetypes, custom authentication using a Groovy script, cookie protection and security strategies, and programming rights and permissions in XWiki, are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while the retrieval context provides information on the requirements and claims for the JWT token (sentences 1, 2, and 4), it lacks specific steps for enabling the token authenticator and configuring authorized applications (sentences 3, 5, and 6).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses various unrelated topics such as attachment mimetype restrictions, custom authentication methods in XWiki, and permissions within a wiki environment, none of which address the specific question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and all provided contradictions indicate that the actual output aligns with the context."
