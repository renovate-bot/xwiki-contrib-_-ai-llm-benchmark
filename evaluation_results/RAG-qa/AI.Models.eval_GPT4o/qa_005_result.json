  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node, which includes the configuration property `oidc.enableUser=true` needed to enable user accounts on first login, is ranked fifth. Irrelevant nodes discussing domain-based authentication and session cookies (first node), prerequisites and installation instructions (second node), dependencies (third node), and logging configuration and short URLs (fourth node) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the 6th node in the retrieval context mentions the `oidc.enableUser` property and its purpose, it lacks specific instructions about adding, updating, uncommenting, setting the property to `true`, saving the file, and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not provide information on how to configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output misses several key points mentioned in the context, such as updating the session cookie configuration, prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator, Logging Admin UI, Logback configuration, short URL setup, and installation instructions using the Extension Manager. However, it correctly describes the enabling of user accounts upon first login using OpenID Connect."
