  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because while the output contains some relevant information, it includes several irrelevant links that do not directly address the issue with the notification icon.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node provides 'general information about the Menu application and other features but does not address the issue of the notification bell not being available.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially supports the expected output by mentioning notifications and preferences, but it lacks specific details about setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context includes irrelevant information such as 'Menu application', 'Display notifications about events happening in the wiki.', and 'Allows users to send emails, inviting friends and colleagues to join a wiki', which do not directly address the issue of the bell icon not being available despite the 'Notification d'alerte' extension being installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently omits several key details mentioned in the context, such as the Menu and Invitation applications, specific notification preferences macros, following a user, default watch settings, programming rights, and prerequisites for extensions. There are no contradictions, but the lack of alignment with the context results in a high hallucination score."
