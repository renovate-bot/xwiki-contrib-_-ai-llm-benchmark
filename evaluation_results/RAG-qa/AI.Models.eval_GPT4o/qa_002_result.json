  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes links to XWiki Syntax documentation, general XWiki features, and RSS documentation, which are not directly related to troubleshooting notification issues.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node mentions the What's New Application and does not provide any information on enabling notifications. The second node lists various notification-related preferences but does not explain how to enable notifications. The third node describes different ways to receive notifications but lacks specific instructions on enabling notifications. The fourth node lists additional features and applications but does not address enabling notifications. The fifth node discusses RSS feeds for notifications but does not provide information on enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.43 because while the retrieval context mentions notifications and various ways to be notified, it lacks specific details such as 'xwiki.properties', following a user, and the 'network' tab in the user profile.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the context discusses various applications and features in XWiki, but does not address the specific issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating no hallucinations."
