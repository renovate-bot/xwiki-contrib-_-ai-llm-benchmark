  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output contains several URLs that are not relevant to restricting file types and sizes for attachments, even though the main response partially addresses the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'programming rights and permissions within the wiki,' which is unrelated to configuring file upload restrictions. Similarly, the second node talks about 'cookie protection levels and IP address usage for encryption,' which is not relevant to file upload settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses permissions, cookie protection, dependencies, OpenOffice integration, and dataset descriptions, none of which address file upload restrictions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple specific details and configurations mentioned in the context, leading to a high degree of factual misalignment."
