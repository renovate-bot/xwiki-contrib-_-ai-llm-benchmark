  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because while the response is mostly relevant, it includes several links that do not directly address the specific issue of the notification bell not being available, which slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses changes in email notifications and macros, but does not address the bell icon issue. The second node explains how to get an RSS feed for notifications but lacks information on enabling notifications. The third node lists macros related to notification preferences without mentioning how to activate notifications. The fourth node discusses email notification settings but not how to enable notifications. The fifth node mentions other features and extensions but does not address enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context, specifically by the 5th node.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific issue of the bell icon's availability with the 'Alert Notification' extension.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output is consistently relevant to the context, addressing various aspects of the Notifications Application, such as troubleshooting, settings, and ensuring the extension is enabled, with no factual alignments indicating any discrepancies."
