  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but the repeated URL provided does not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the 'nbf' claim indicates the token is rejected if this time is in the future, whereas the retrieval context states that the 'nbf' claim indicates the time before which the token is not valid.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the first rank provides detailed information on the required claims for the JWT token and how it should be signed with an Ed25519 key, which is crucial for authenticating users with access tokens. All irrelevant nodes discussing document retrieval and management within a wiki (second rank), cookie protection and IP address usage for login (third rank), domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration (fourth rank), and LDAP configuration for authentication (fifth rank) are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the information provided in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context focuses on document management and various authentication methods in XWiki, but does not address user authentication with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output fails to mention several key details from the provided context, such as document ID retrieval, protection levels for 'remember me' cookies, domain-based instance configuration, session cookie configuration, OpenID Connect, and LDAP configuration settings. However, it aligns with the context on the use of JWT tokens for authentication in XWiki."
