  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is mostly relevant and addresses the issue of the 'Bell' icon not appearing in XWiki, but the provided URL does not directly address this specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in retrieval context are irrelevant, as they do not address the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki. For example, the first node 'provides information about various XWiki extensions and features but does not address the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki,' and the second node 'mentions a 'What's New' application for notifications about news but does not provide information on enabling notifications in the wiki.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not provide any information about the 'Bell' in the top right corner or the 'Alert Notification' extension, focusing instead on unrelated XWiki features and extensions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several critical details that are present in the context, such as the Menu application, Invitation application, 'What's New' application, specific notification preferences macros, dependencies for the notifications extension, and details about email notifications. There are no contradictions, but the omissions lead to a high hallucination score."
