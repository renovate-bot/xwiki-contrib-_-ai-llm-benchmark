  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.97 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information on how to disable notifications in XWiki. However, it includes a link to XWiki syntax documentation, which is not directly related to managing or disabling notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.87 because the actual output incorrectly states that notification settings can be accessed by clicking on the avatar or username, and it also incorrectly mentions an 'Auto Watch Preferences' section for changing auto-watch settings, neither of which are supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.76 because the relevant nodes are generally ranked higher, such as the first node which 'mentions custom filters that can be customized by users,' and the third node which states 'Watching a location automatically create a custom notification filter.' However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, like the second node which 'only lists various notification preferences macros,' are ranked above relevant ones.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is perfectly relevant and there are no reasons for irrelevancy. Great job!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions indicating that the actual output does not align with the provided context."
