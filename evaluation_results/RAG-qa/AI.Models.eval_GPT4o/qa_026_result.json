  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer addresses the main question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant statements about database support, forms, scalability, performance features, and the Office Importer feature.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration', which is not related to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider. Similarly, the second node talks about 'XWiki's use of a relational database', which also does not relate to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like domain-based authentication, session cookies, and XWiki's scalability, which do not address the input question about mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key details and topics that are present in the context, indicating a high level of hallucination."
