  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides a clear solution, but it includes a URL that is not directly related to configuring permissions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly states that all home pages are named `WebHome` or `TeamA.WebHome`, while users can create pages with different names.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.45 because the first node, which explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki, and the third node, which discusses executing a migration plan, are ranked higher than the second node, which provides information about XWiki's permission system. Additionally, the fourth node, which describes various authentication mechanisms, is ranked higher than the fifth node, which outlines basic rules for setting wiki-wide and page-level rights. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all the steps and details in the expected output are well-supported by the information in the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the context discusses features and migration plans in XWiki but does not address configuring team permissions for spaces.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.60 because the actual output misses several key details and concepts such as spaces and WebHome pages, temporary emulation of sub-pages, Terminal Pages, executing a plan, server resource usage, migration recommendations, authentication mechanisms, the Distribution Wizard, and specific XWiki Standard features and extensions. However, it correctly explains setting view and edit rights, which aligns with the context provided."
