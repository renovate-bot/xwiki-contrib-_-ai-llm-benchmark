  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the provided URLs do not directly address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but the rest of the information is relevant and helpful.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly states that denying rights at a lower level takes precedence over granting rights at a higher level, while the retrieval context specifies that the priority order is allow > deny > no setting.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses the 'AuthorizationSettler and the process of settling access decisions,' which does not address the specific issue of denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like AuthorizationSettler, custom rights registration, and technical API details, none of which address how to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to include multiple key details provided in the context, such as customizable components, specific rights, registration processes, and additional information about implied rights and inheritance. There are no contradictions, but the omissions result in a high hallucination score."
