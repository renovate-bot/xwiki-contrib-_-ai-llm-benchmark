  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the output includes several URLs that are not directly related to configuring permissions as requested in the input. However, the score is relatively high because the main content still addresses the core question about setting permissions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses the scope of configuration display in XWiki, but does not provide specific steps or details on setting access rights for spaces and teams. The second node explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki, but does not address how to set access rights for different teams. The third node provides information on XWiki's scalability and multi-tenancy but does not offer guidance on configuring access rights for spaces and teams. The fourth node mentions changing page access rights, but it does not provide a detailed procedure for setting up team-specific access controls as required by the input. The fifth node discusses the storage and database support of XWiki pages, which is unrelated to configuring access rights for spaces and teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the steps or details in the expected output are mentioned in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the user's specific question about configuring team spaces and permissions in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple critical details present in the context, such as configuration options, spaces and sub-pages, multi-tenancy and clustering capabilities, actions on pages, subwikis, panels, and relational database support. There are no contradictions, but the absence of these key details results in a high hallucination score."
