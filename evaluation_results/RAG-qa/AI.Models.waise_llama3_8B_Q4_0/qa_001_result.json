    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is entirely relevant and addresses the issue stated in the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node explains the bell icon in the top bar, which is directly relevant to the input statement. Irrelevant nodes, such as metadata about the notifications application (rank 2), table of contents (rank 3), menu and other features (rank 4), and dependencies list (rank 5), are appropriately ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
