    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.27 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower. For example, the first node 'provides general information about allowing an XWiki instance to authenticate on an OpenID Connect provider' and the second node 'lists dependencies for the extension,' both of which are irrelevant to customizing user profile fields. However, the fifth node 'mentions the `xwiki.properties` file, which is relevant to customizing user profile fields' and the sixth node 'provides details on the available variables for mapping user profile fields,' which are directly relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, demonstrating a perfect alignment."
