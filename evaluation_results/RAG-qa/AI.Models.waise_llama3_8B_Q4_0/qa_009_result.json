  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.70 because the output partially addresses the question but includes irrelevant information, such as a URL that does not directly answer how to deny script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly states that the default state for `SCRIPT` is `DENY`, while the retrieval context specifies that the default status of the `Script` right is ALLOWED on the main wiki.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question, discussing topics like 'Script' right implications, checking access rights programmatically, migrating page rights, security methods, and rights constants, none of which address denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output, with clear references to the non-deniability of rights implied by admin rights."
