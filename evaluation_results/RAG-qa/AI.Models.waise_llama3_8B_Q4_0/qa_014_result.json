    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.35 because many URLs and statements provided are not directly relevant to the question about disabling notifications, leading to a low relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'customizing page templates, adding menus, and modifying CSS files', which is not relevant to disabling notifications. The second node discusses 'adding and removing keyboard shortcuts', which is also unrelated to notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context."
