  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but the mention of 'Default Notification Settings' does not provide specific steps or information on how to disable notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node talks about removing notifications that were sent till now and changing settings for receiving notifications for one's own actions, but it does not address disabling notifications for pages automatically added to the watch list. The second node is about enabling or disabling email notifications at the administrator level and does not provide information on how a user can disable notifications for pages they are not interested in. The third node discusses various filters and options for notifications but does not address the automatic addition of pages to the watch list or how to disable such notifications. The fourth node is about administrators configuring notification settings for all users and does not provide information on how an individual user can disable notifications for pages they are not interested in. The fifth node is about overriding default notification templates and installation instructions for an extension, which is not relevant to disabling notifications for pages automatically added to the watch list.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because some details like default notification behavior and changing settings are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, but specific mentions of being notified about changes on your work and 'Automatic page watching' are not found."
