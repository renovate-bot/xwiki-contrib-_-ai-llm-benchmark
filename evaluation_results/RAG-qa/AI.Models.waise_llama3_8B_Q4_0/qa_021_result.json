    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is fully relevant and addresses the issue without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output incorrectly states that you cannot access notifications from the top right menu, while the retrieval context clearly mentions that notifications are displayed on the top menu above the bell.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to enabling notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file. For example, the first node 'provides a description and links related to notifications but does not address enabling notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file', and the fifth node 'gives a general description of the notifications application and its interface but does not mention enabling notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions enabling notifications in a general sense (node 1), it does not provide specific details about defining the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`."
