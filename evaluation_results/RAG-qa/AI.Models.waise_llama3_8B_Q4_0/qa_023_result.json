  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about enabling notifications for personal actions. However, it includes URLs that are not directly related to the specific query, which slightly reduces the relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly claims that users do not receive notifications when actions are performed on pages they created or updated by default, whereas the retrieval context states that users do get notifications in such scenarios by default.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Filter your own events' and is directly related to enabling notifications for one's own actions, is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node which lists various links and descriptions related to the Notifications Application without specific details about enabling or disabling notifications for one's own actions, are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output can be accurately attributed to nodes in the retrieval context, showcasing a perfect match."
