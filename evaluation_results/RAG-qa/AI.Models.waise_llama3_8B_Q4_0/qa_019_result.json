    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer provides relevant information but includes multiple URLs that are not directly related to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions identified.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. The first node discusses 'various validation options and messages for fields', the second node contains 'image links and references to various projects or entities', the third node is about 'recommending templates and creating terminal pages', the fourth node contains 'more image links and references', and the fifth node is about 'custom right checks and configuration classes'. None of these nodes address the topic of denying script rights to an area administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the provided retrieval context does not mention anything about XWiki not supporting the denial of rights implied by the Admin right."
