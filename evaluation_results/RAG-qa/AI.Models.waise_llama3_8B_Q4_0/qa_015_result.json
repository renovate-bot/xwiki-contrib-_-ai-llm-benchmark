    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) is surrounded by irrelevant nodes that discuss general information, installation instructions, and dependencies for OpenID Connect Authenticator (rank 1, 2, 4, 5), which do not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts on first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and the `oidc.enableUser=true` property, it does not explicitly state that new user accounts will be automatically activated upon first login via OpenID Connect."
