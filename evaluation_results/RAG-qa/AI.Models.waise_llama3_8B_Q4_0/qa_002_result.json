  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes an irrelevant URL which slightly detracts from its usefulness.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the first and fifth nodes are relevant and ranked correctly, providing direct information on enabling notifications and following a user to receive notifications. However, the second, third, and fourth nodes are irrelevant as they describe the interface, behavior, and email settings of notifications without addressing enabling or subscribing to notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because while the retrieval context covers enabling notifications and following users, it misses explicit details on subscribing to pages or users for notifications."
