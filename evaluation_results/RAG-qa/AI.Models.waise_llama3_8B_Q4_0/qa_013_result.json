    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the provided URL is repeated multiple times and is not directly relevant to enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, the response still partially addresses the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node describes 'the configuration of authorized applications', which is unrelated to notifications about user activity. The second node discusses 'themes, internationalization, and other features of XWiki' that do not address notifications for user activity. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
