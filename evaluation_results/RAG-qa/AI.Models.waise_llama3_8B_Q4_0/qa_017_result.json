  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the question accurately. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly states that you need to add the claim xwiki_groups to the property oidc.userinfoclaims in the xwiki.properties file to enable group synchronization.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.81 because while most relevant nodes are ranked higher, there are still some irrelevant nodes ranked higher than more pertinent ones. For example, the second node, which 'only lists dependencies for the extension,' and the fifth node, which 'provides general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator,' should be ranked lower than the more relevant nodes that directly discuss 'group synchronization' and configuring the `xwiki.properties` file.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate guide for group synchronization in XWiki."
