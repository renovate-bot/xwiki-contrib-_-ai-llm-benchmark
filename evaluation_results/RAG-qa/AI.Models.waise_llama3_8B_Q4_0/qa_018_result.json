  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output is completely relevant and directly addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output incorrectly suggests that setting the max_allowed_packet to 30 MB ensures a 10 MB attachment limit, and it incorrectly implies a need to configure max_allowed_packet for attachments larger than 30 MB. Additionally, it fails to accurately reflect that attachments larger than 30MB are not possible in the Database Attachment Store.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is relevant as it 'provides steps to change the maximum size of an attachment,' is correctly ranked higher than some irrelevant nodes. However, the first node, which 'does not directly address how to limit uploads to images or PDFs with a maximum size of 10 MB,' is incorrectly ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.69 because while the retrieval context provides detailed steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (related to sentences in steps 2 and 3 of the expected output), it lacks information on configuring allowable MIME types and ensuring only images or PDFs are uploaded (related to steps 1 and 2 of the expected output)."
