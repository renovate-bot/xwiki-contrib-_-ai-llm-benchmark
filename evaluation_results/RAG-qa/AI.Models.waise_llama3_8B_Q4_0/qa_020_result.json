  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because the output contains relevant information about configuring view and edit permissions in XWiki, but it also includes several irrelevant links and references that do not directly address the specific question about team area permissions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'REST API implementation', the second node provides 'an image and a link to managing users and groups' without specific steps, the third node talks about 'group synchronization using OpenID Connect', the fourth node focuses on 'LDAP group configurations and mappings', and the fifth node discusses 'using nested pages and subwikis'. None of these address the specific access control configuration required for teams in XWiki, leading to a low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context."
