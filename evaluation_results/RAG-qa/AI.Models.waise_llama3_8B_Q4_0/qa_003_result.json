  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer addresses the question about enabling notifications for own actions, but includes irrelevant links that do not pertain to the specific issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses getting an RSS feed of notifications, which does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. The second node lists various notification preferences macros but does not provide information on enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node includes links about customizing notification emails and other developer-related actions, which are not relevant to enabling notifications for one's own actions. The fourth node discusses overriding default notification templates and installation instructions, which are not related to enabling notifications for one's own actions. The fifth node is about administrators configuring notification settings for users and does not address how an individual user can enable notifications for their own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context supports the first sentence of the expected output but does not provide information on 'Advanced filtering options' or disabling filters in the user profile."
