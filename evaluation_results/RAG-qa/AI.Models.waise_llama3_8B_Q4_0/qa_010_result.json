  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer mostly addresses configuring permissions in XWiki, but includes irrelevant details about enabling Advanced Profile and accessing the full editing menu, which are not directly related to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.62 because the actual output repeatedly refers to setting permissions and performing actions at the 'Space' level, whereas the retrieval context clearly states that the notion of space has been removed from the XWiki UI. Additionally, the actual output mentions an 'Access Rights' tab that is not referenced in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes are relevant and ranked correctly, but the second node, which discusses the concept of spaces and sub-pages without providing information on configuring access rights, should be ranked lower. Additionally, the fourth node about the advanced editing profile and the fifth node about enabling/disabling statistics should also be ranked lower as they do not pertain to setting access rights for different teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because the retrieval context effectively supports most of the steps and instructions in the expected output, such as creating groups, setting wiki-wide and space-level rights, and inheriting rights for child pages. However, it does not explicitly mention adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces."
