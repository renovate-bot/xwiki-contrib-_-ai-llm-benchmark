  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about disabling notifications. However, the inclusion of unrelated URLs slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions present. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.87 because the relevant nodes are ranked higher overall, but there are still irrelevant nodes like the third node, which is about 'getting a notification RSS feed and general settings,' and the fourth node, which discusses 'email notifications and other customization options,' that should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context supports the inclusion of automatic page watching and notification of changes (sentences 1 and 2), it lacks information about modifying the automatic watch settings and removing custom notification filters (sentences 3 and 4)."
