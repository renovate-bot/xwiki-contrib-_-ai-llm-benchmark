    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and references to OpenID Connect endpoints (rank 3), is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific question, and the second node lists dependencies for the extension, which are not relevant to customizing user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
