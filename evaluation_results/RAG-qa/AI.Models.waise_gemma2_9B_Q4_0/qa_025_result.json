  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the provided answer is highly relevant and addresses the core question about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes a link related to LDAP Authenticator, which is not pertinent to the issue at hand.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node 'provides links to prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies' without addressing the specific configuration needed. The second node 'lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' but doesn't provide relevant configuration information. The third node discusses 'LDAP authentication and Active Directory integration,' which is unrelated. The fourth node references the OpenID Connect Authenticator Extension but lacks specific configuration details. Lastly, the fifth node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but not the required configuration for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because most sentences in the expected output cannot be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
