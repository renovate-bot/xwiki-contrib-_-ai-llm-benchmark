  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the provided URLs do not directly address the input question about restricting file types and sizes, although some relevant information might still be present.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the maximum allowed file size is 10 MB, while the retrieval context indicates that the default maximum size of an attachment is 100GB and 32MB for XWiki versions less than 10.9RC1.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node explaining how to set limits on the maximum size of an attachment is ranked second. However, irrelevant nodes providing links to various sections of the XWiki documentation (first node), listing features unrelated to MIME type restrictions (third node), discussing database attachment store and directory cleanup (fourth node), and listing macros and their functionalities (fifth node) are ranked higher or mixed with relevant information.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.64 because while the retrieval context's 2nd node covers many steps related to configuring MIME type restrictions and changing the maximum upload size, it does not provide specific details on ensuring only images or PDF files are uploaded or the exact configuration in the `xwiki.properties` file."
