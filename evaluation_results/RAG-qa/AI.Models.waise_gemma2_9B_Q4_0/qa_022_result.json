    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response contains useful information related to notifications, but includes irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node 'lists various features and settings of the Notifications Application but does not directly address enabling notifications or following users and pages,' and the second node 'describes how to get a notification RSS feed and mentions the Notifications Macro but does not provide information on enabling notifications or following users and pages.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
