  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the issue of the notification bell icon not being available in XWiki, but includes a minor irrelevant closing remark.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) providing details about changing notification settings by administrators is ranked lower than four irrelevant nodes (ranks 1, 2, 3, and 5) that do not address enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions enabling notifications in the wiki, it does not specifically mention the setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` or changing it to `true`."
