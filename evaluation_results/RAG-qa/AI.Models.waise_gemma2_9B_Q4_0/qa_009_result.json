  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the answer partially addresses the question but includes a link that does not directly address how to deny script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "Great job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses the Script right and its default status but does not address denying script rights specifically to a space administrator. The second node talks about the checkAccess and hasAccess methods, which are unrelated to denying script rights to a space administrator. The third node is about converting rights during page migration, which is not relevant. The fourth node again discusses the checkAccess method without covering the topic of denying script rights. The fifth node lists various rights and their properties but does not provide information on denying script rights specifically to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!"
