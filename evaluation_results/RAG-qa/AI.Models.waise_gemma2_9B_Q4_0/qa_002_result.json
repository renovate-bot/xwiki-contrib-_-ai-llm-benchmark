  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is mostly relevant but includes a URL that does not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are correctly ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node is relevant as it 'mentions the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`,' and the second node is relevant as it 'describes the notification system, including the bell icon and alert menu.' Irrelevant nodes, such as the third node, which 'mainly describes the visual aspects of notifications,' are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.43 because while there is some alignment with enabling notifications and the alert menu, key details such as subscribing to pages or users, following users via the User Index, and the 'network' tab are not mentioned in the nodes in the retrieval context."
