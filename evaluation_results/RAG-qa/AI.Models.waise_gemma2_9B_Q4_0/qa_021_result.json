  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the issue directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output claims that notifications in XWiki only display when you are logged in, but the retrieval context does not mention this requirement.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, as they do not address the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki. For instance, the first node 'mainly provides links and descriptions related to the Notifications Application,' while the second node 'lists dependencies for the Notifications Application.' Both of these do not provide the needed information.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially supports the expected output by mentioning notifications settings (node 3 in retrieval context), but it lacks specific details about 'xwiki.properties' and 'notifications.enabled'."
