  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.27 because the first four nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, providing general information, dependencies, installation instructions, and configuration guides, none of which address customizing user profile fields. The relevant nodes that discuss the `xwiki.properties` file and variables for OpenID Connect user profile fields are ranked lower, at positions 5 and 6.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the relevant nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
