  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because while the output includes some potentially useful information about seeking help and the XWiki Forum, it does not provide a direct answer to the specific configuration question asked. The inclusion of irrelevant suggestions about asking questions or seeking support lowers the relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not mention the specific configuration required to automatically activate user accounts on first login. The second node describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator but lacks details on the specific configuration needed for automatic activation. The third node mentions the xwiki.properties file but does not include the specific property `oidc.enableUser` or instructions to set it for automatic user activation. The fourth node lists dependencies but does not provide information on the configuration needed for automatic activation. The fifth node includes various endpoints and advanced configuration options but does not address the specific configuration required to automatically activate user accounts on first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are directly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a perfect match."
