  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the first node provides relevant details on configuring group synchronization, including specific properties like `oidc.userinfoclaims` and `oidc.groups.mapping`. However, the second, third, and fourth nodes, which are ranked higher than the fifth node, focus on the authentication process, dependencies, and `xwiki.cfg` file, which are not directly relevant to group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks specific details and instructions such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, providing example Java code, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance."
