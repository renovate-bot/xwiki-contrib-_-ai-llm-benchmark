    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes a URL that does not directly address the question about restricting file types and sizes for attachments on a wiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various macros and functionalities in XWiki,' which is not related to file upload restrictions or MIME type settings. Similarly, the second node lists 'various image references and links,' which also does not pertain to configuring file upload restrictions or MIME type settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context."
