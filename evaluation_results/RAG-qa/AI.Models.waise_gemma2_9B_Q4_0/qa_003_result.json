    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the provided URL does not directly address the question about enabling notifications for the user's own actions, though the rest of the answer is relevant and helpful.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and general notification settings', the second node lists 'various notification preferences macros', the third node covers 'various notification settings like frequency of emails and custom filters', the fourth node explains 'how to override default notification templates and installation instructions', and the fifth node is about 'administrators configuring default notification settings'. None of these nodes address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output could be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context."
