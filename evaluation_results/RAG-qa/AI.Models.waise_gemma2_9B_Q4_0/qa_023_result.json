    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because while the answer addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, it includes URLs that are not directly relevant to the specific issue, which slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node that mentions 'Filter your own events,' which is directly related to the user's question, is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
