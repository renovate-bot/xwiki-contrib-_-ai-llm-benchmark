  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because while the response addresses the missing 'Bell' icon issue, it includes irrelevant URLs and details about the 'Notifications Application' extension that do not directly help with the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node's 'description of the application and its features does not provide information on how to enable notifications in the wiki,' and the second node's 'table with details about the bell and notification display does not address the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions notifications in general (1st and 3rd nodes in retrieval context), it does not provide any information about enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` settings file."
