    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the input question perfectly. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the relevant nodes providing information on setting view and edit rights in XWiki are ranked higher. For instance, the first node discusses the 'granular permission system' and the third node explains 'setting wiki-wide and page-level rights,' both directly addressing the input query. However, the second node, which does not provide relevant information, is ranked higher than the third node, which impacts the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring accurate and complete information."
