    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the first node is relevant and mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property, which are crucial for configuring group synchronization. However, the second, third, and fourth nodes, ranked 2nd, 3rd, and 4th respectively, are not directly relevant as they discuss prerequisites, installation, dependencies, and troubleshooting rather than specific configuration steps. The fifth node is relevant but is ranked lower than the irrelevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all the steps and details in the expected output are completely and accurately supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
