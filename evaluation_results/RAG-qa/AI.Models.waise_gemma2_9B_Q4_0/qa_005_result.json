  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and mostly addresses the question about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes an irrelevant statement about the LDAP Authenticator, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output incorrectly states that the `xwiki.authentication.createuser` property should be set to `true` instead of `empty`, and it also incorrectly claims that a server restart is needed for changes to the `xwiki.cfg` file, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts discuss topics such as container authentication, LDAP configuration, and general OpenID Connect settings, but none mention the specific `oidc.enableUser` property or the exact configuration needed in the `xwiki.properties` file to automatically enable user accounts on first login. Therefore, the relevant nodes are not ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context mentions 'xwiki.properties' and configuring properties related to authentication, there is no explicit mention of adding or updating a specific property or enabling user accounts upon first login using OpenID Connect."
