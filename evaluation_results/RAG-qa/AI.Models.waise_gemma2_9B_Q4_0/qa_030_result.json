    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer is mostly relevant to configuring team permissions in XWiki, but it includes URLs that are not directly related to the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions detected. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'does not provide any information on setting access controls or permissions', the second node 'does not address access control or permissions', and the third node 'does not provide guidance on configuring access controls or permissions'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context."
