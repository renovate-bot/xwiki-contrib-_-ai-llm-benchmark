    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the provided URLs and statements do not directly address the issue of enabling notifications for one's own activity, making the response partially relevant.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions in the actual output. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'configuring authorized applications' which does not address notifications or user activity, and the second node discusses 'customizing page templates' which is also unrelated to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
