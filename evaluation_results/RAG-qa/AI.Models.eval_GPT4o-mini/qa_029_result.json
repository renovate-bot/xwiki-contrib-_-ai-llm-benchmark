  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes a link to an extension related to attachment validation UI, which is not directly relevant to the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.60 because the actual output incorrectly states that administration rights cannot be denied at the page level and that users with administration rights cannot be restricted from executing scripts, whereas the retrieval context specifies that only the wiki administrator cannot have their rights denied for a page and that programming rights are separate from administration rights.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'color themes, access for unregistered users, and other unrelated topics', the second node explains 'various rights such as comment, edit, delete, and administration rights' but not script rights, the third node discusses 'programming rights and other special permissions', the fourth node is about 'blocked attachment mimetypes', and the fifth node provides 'a link to additional information about rights and inheritance' but does not address the specific question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context primarily discusses Color Themes, icon fonts, and general wiki access rights, but does not specifically address how to refuse script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and the contradictions listed do not indicate any actual contradictions between the actual output and the contexts provided."
