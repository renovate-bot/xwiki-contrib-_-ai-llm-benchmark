  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but the provided URL does not directly address the input query about how to deny script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses the configuration and implementation of the AuthorizationSettler, which is not directly relevant to denying script rights to a domain administrator. Similarly, the second node talks about registering and unregistering custom rights, which does not address the specific issue of denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the information provided in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to deny script rights to a domain administrator, instead discussing general authorization concepts and API details.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key components and configurations described in the context, such as the AuthorizationSettler, specific rights, methods for registering/unregistering rights, and details about implied rights and inheritance. There are no contradictions, but the lack of alignment with the provided context results in a high hallucination score."
