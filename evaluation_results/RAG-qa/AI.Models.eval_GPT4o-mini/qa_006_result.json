  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. However, it includes an irrelevant statement about LDAP authenticator, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which discusses 'oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}' and 'oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}', is ranked first, while irrelevant nodes discussing domain-based authentication, group synchronization, group mappings, and LDAP groups are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because the retrieval context supports the customization of user profile fields and provides examples for mapping, but it lacks details on replacing property names and the steps to save and restart XWiki.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context focuses on domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and group synchronization, which are not relevant to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, such as domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, group synchronization, and LDAP group configurations. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
