  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node that includes the specific property `oidc.enableUser=true` that needs to be set in the `xwiki.properties` file to enable user accounts on first login is ranked 5th. Irrelevant nodes discussing 'domain-based authentication and session cookies' (1st), 'general information about OpenID Connect and its dependencies' (2nd), 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' (3rd), and 'logging configuration and short URLs' (4th) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because the retrieval context only partially matches the expected output, specifically mentioning the 'oidc.enableUser' property but lacking details on adding, updating, uncommenting, saving, and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses domain-based instance configuration, session cookie settings, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output omits several critical details present in the context, such as the need to update the session cookie configuration for domain-based instances, prerequisites, installation instructions, automatic synchronization, dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator, and logging configuration. These omissions significantly reduce the factual alignment with the provided context."
