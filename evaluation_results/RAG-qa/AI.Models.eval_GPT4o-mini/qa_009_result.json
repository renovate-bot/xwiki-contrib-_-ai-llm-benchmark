  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes URLs that are not directly related to the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly specifies that the SCRIPT right can be denied to a space administrator and that denying this right will prevent the space administrator from executing user-written scripts, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'Programming Right' which does not address the specific question, and the second node discusses 'Color Themes' which is unrelated to script rights for a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses various rights like Programming Right, Register Right, and Create Wikis Right, but does not mention anything specific about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention or address numerous key elements discussed in the context, including programming rights, Color Themes, icon fonts, Forgot Username and Password functionality, main wiki access rights, comment right, edit right, delete right, special permissions, AuthorizationSettler, and right constants. This indicates a high level of hallucination."
