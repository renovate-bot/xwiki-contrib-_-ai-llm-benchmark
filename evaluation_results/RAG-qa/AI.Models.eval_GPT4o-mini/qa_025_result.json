  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims the authentication class should be 'org.xwiki.contrib.oidc.authenticator.OIDCAuthenticator', while the retrieval context does not mention this class and instead refers to 'xwiki.authentication.authclass' for in-wiki configuration.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator' but does not address the specific configuration needed. Similarly, the second node discusses 'domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is not relevant. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than any relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because the retrieval context only partially supports the expected output, specifically mentioning the use of xwiki.properties for configuration but lacking details on specific properties, instructions, and outcomes related to enabling user accounts with OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific issue of automatically activating user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating perfect alignment."
