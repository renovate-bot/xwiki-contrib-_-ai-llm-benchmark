  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the provided URL does not directly address the issue of the notification bell not being available, despite the extension being installed. However, the response is somewhat relevant as it attempts to provide a resource.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'does not provide information on enabling notifications', the second node 'does not mention enabling notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file', and the third node 'does not address enabling notifications in the `xwiki.properties` file'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the importance of notifications in the wiki is supported by the retrieval context, there is no mention of defining the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` on `true`.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the issue of the bell icon not being available even when the 'Notification d'alerte' extension is installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not directly relate to any of the contexts provided, which cover various features, preferences, permissions, and installation instructions in XWiki. The actual output provides troubleshooting steps for a notification issue, which is not mentioned in the contexts."
