  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but includes several irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node discussing 'various notification preferences, including custom filters' is ranked fifth, while irrelevant nodes about 'menu applications and other features', 'authorization settler components and right definitions', 'blocked attachment mimetypes and their configuration', and 'access checking methods and security measures' are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only the second sentence in the expected output could be linked to the 5th node in the retrieval context, while the first sentence could not be attributed to any node in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various unrelated topics such as 'AuthorizationSettler', 'blocked attachment mimetypes', and 'access control mechanisms', none of which address how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several important details mentioned in the factual alignments, such as information about the Menu application, AuthorizationSettler, blocked attachment mimetypes, checkAccess() method, and notification preferences macros. There are no contradictions, but the absence of these details indicates a high level of hallucination."
