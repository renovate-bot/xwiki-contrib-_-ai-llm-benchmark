  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the main response addresses the query about restricting file uploads to images or PDFs of a maximum size of 10 MB. However, multiple URLs provided in the response are irrelevant as they point to unrelated topics such as permission types, authentication, the Office Importer feature, and the XWiki RESTful API.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'programming rights, register rights, and script rights,' which are not related to file upload restrictions or MIME type configurations. Similarly, the second node talks about 'cookie protection levels and IP address usage for encryption,' which are also unrelated to the configuration of file uploads or MIME types.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses user permissions, security settings, and configurations unrelated to file upload restrictions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output omits several critical details mentioned in the context, such as programming rights, security settings, dependencies, server configurations, and dataset information. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
