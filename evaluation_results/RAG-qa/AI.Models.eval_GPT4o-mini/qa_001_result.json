  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because while the response includes some relevant information, it is diluted by multiple irrelevant statements and general links that do not specifically address the issue with the 'Bell' icon.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node 'does not address the issue of enabling notifications', the second node 'does not provide information on enabling notifications', the third node 'does not address the need to enable notifications in the xwiki.properties file', the fourth node 'does not address enabling notifications in the xwiki.properties file', and the fifth node 'does not mention enabling notifications in the xwiki.properties file'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly aligns with the expected output, providing clear and relevant information about enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context includes irrelevant parts such as 'Menu application', 'Invitation', and 'Other features can be added to your wiki by installing extensions not listed above' which do not pertain to the availability of the 'Bell' icon or the 'Alert Notification' extension in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks significant information present in the context, including details about the Menu application, Notifications, Invitation, extensions, What's New Application, notification preferences macros, dependencies for the extension org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-notifications-ui 16.3.1, and email notifications settings."
