  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because while the answer addresses the customization of user profile fields using OpenID Connect in XWiki, it includes multiple irrelevant links that do not directly relate to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics irrelevant to mapping user profile fields from OpenID Connect. For example, the first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is not relevant. The second node talks about 'XWiki's use of relational databases and programming features,' and the third node describes 'form utilization on XWiki.org,' both of which are unrelated to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention customizing user profile fields, mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file, or any of the specific details provided in the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various unrelated topics such as domain-based instance configuration, session cookie settings, and OpenOffice server configuration, none of which address customizing or mapping user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several specific details mentioned in the context, such as domain-based instance configuration, bypassing OpenID Connect, relational database storage, support for various databases, reference form and questionnaire form features, scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering features, and OpenOffice server configuration. There are no contradictions, but the omissions result in a high hallucination score."
