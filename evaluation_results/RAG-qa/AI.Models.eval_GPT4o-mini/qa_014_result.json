  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the answer provides some relevant information about disabling notifications, but it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'defining blocked attachment mimetypes', which does not relate to notifications or how to disable them. Similarly, the second node discusses 'setting the default language for a wiki page', which is unrelated to notifications or their settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, setting default languages for wiki pages, and technical details about XWiki's directory cleanup, none of which relate to disabling notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple critical details that are essential for completeness and accuracy, as highlighted by the factual alignments. There are no contradictions, but the omissions significantly impact the overall reliability."
