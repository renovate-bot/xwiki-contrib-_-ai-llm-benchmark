  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the core instructions on configuring OpenID Connect authentication in XWiki are addressed well. However, the inclusion of unrelated details about Accessibility documentation, user roles and permissions, and checking logs and error messages detracts from the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output incorrectly suggests checking the `xwiki.cfg` file for specific configurations for the authenticator, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that the OIDC authenticator does not rely on the property xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains in xwiki.cfg.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', which is not relevant to the automatic activation of user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect. Similarly, the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator and its installation' but does not mention the specific configuration needed. The third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', which is unrelated to the required configuration. The fourth node discusses 'accessibility and WCAG compliance', which is also unrelated. Lastly, the fifth node provides information on 'creating custom authentication methods', which does not address the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring accurate and comprehensive information.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various aspects of authentication and configuration in XWiki, but none of them address the specific issue of automatically activating user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks significant details across multiple important areas such as authentication specifics, session cookie configuration, prerequisites, dependencies, accessibility guidelines, and custom authentication configuration. There are no contradictions, but the absence of these critical details results in a high hallucination score."
