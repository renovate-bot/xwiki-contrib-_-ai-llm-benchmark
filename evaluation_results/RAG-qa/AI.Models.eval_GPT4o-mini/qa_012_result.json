  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the main issue of not receiving notifications was addressed, but the inclusion of multiple irrelevant URLs lowered the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'blocked attachment mimetypes and their configuration', the second node is about 'protection levels for cookies and authentication strategies', the third node covers 'programming rights and permissions in XWiki', the fourth node discusses 'various user rights such as comment, edit, delete, and administration rights', and the fifth node is about 'directory cleanup and database attachment store configurations'. None of these contexts pertain to notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses attachment mimetype restrictions, security configurations, user permissions, and directory cleanup, which are all irrelevant to the input 'Ich erhalte keine Benachrichtigungen.'",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several critical details mentioned in the context, such as the configuration of blocked attachment mimetypes, protection levels for 'remember me' cookies, various rights and their configurations, and directory cleanup settings. There are no contradictions, but the omissions are significant."
