  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information on how to disable notifications in XWiki. However, the inclusion of a link to XWiki Syntax documentation, which is not directly related to managing notifications, slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.37 because the first and second nodes describe filters and notification preferences macros, which are not relevant to disabling notifications. The third node, which is relevant, is ranked lower. Additionally, the fourth node discusses RSS feed settings, which is also not relevant, while the fifth node, which is relevant, is ranked even lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is perfectly relevant and there are no reasons for irrelevancy. Great job!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.20 because the actual output aligns well with the context in terms of managing and configuring notification settings, but it lacks specific details about the various notification preference macros mentioned in the context."
