  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because the output contains several irrelevant links to general documentation and extensions that do not directly address the question about authenticating users with access tokens. However, the core information about authentication with access tokens is still present, which is why the score is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is directly relevant as it provides detailed information about the requirements and generation of JWT tokens, is ranked lower than the first node, which discusses the usage of forms on XWiki.org and is unrelated to authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while some sentences in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, such as those related to JWT token claims and the Authorization header, other sentences lack corresponding information in the retrieval context, particularly those about activating the authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and the limitations of the authenticator.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses form utilization, authorization management, and various wiki features, none of which are relevant to user authentication with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, such as the Reference Form, Questionnaire Form, AuthorizationSettler, ConfigurableClass objects, and various applications. However, it correctly aligns with the context regarding the process of generating JWT tokens and the necessary claims for authentication in XWiki."
