  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because while the answer provides some useful information, it includes multiple URLs that do not directly address the specific question about configuring team spaces in XWiki, which reduces its overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying true to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses the scope of configuration display in XWiki administration, which does not address access control or permissions for teams. Similarly, the second node explains how spaces and pages are created and managed in XWiki but does not provide information on setting access rights for different teams. The third node describes XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering features, which are unrelated to configuring team-specific access rights. The fourth node mentions actions like creating pages and changing access rights but does not provide specific steps or guidelines on setting access rights for different teams. Lastly, the fifth node discusses XWiki's database storage and programming features, which are not relevant to configuring access control for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.38 because while the retrieval context (node 4) aligns with the overall theme of access control and rights modification, it lacks specific details on creating groups, defining rights at different levels, and inheriting rights for child pages as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific question of configuring visibility and editing permissions for team spaces in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple specific details mentioned in the context, including configuration options, creation of spaces and sub-pages, multi-tenancy, clustering, relational database storage, and supported databases. There are no contradictions, but the absence of these key details indicates a high level of hallucination."
