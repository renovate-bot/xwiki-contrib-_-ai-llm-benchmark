  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.06 because the majority of the statements in the output are irrelevant and do not provide any useful information related to enabling notifications for own actions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node lists various notification preferences macros but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The second node describes different ways to receive notifications in XWiki but does not provide information on enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node discusses email notifications and their configuration but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially aligns with the expected output, specifically regarding the ability to disable filters in the notification settings, but it does not mention the default behavior of not receiving notifications about one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context lists various notification-related macros and general information about notifications in XWiki, but it does not provide specific instructions on how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not provide any relevant information related to the context about notifications or preferences in XWiki, resulting in a complete misalignment with the expected information."
