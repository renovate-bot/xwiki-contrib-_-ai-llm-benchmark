  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant statements that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the context about 'blocked attachment mimetypes' in the first node, 'programming rights and permissions' in the second node, and 'comment, edit, delete rights, and special permissions' in the third node are all irrelevant to notifications settings or enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses configuring blocked attachment mimetypes and various permissions in a wiki environment, which are irrelevant to the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information about configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, specific programming rights, register rights, create wikis rights, comment, edit, delete rights, and special permissions like administration rights, which are essential for factual alignment."
