  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user account activation with OpenID Connect. However, it includes an irrelevant statement about downloading a configuration guide for Lemon LDAP, which does not pertain to the specific issue raised.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly claims that domain-based configuration ensures automatic account activation after login, and that the '/oidc.skipped=true' option will automatically load user accounts, which are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies' but does not address automatic activation of user accounts. The second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication' without mentioning the specific configuration needed. The third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' but lacks information about configuring automatic user account activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring properties related to OpenID Connect in the xwiki.properties file (supporting sentence 1), it lacks details on adding/updating specific properties, uncommenting and setting `oidc.enableUser` to true, restarting the XWiki instance, and automatic activation of new user accounts (sentences 2-5).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, which are not relevant to the automatic activation of user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions between the actual output and the context."
