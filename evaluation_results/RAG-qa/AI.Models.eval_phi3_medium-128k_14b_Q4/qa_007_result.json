  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.03 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, providing crucial information about the `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties for configuring group synchronization. However, the second node, which is about domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration, is not relevant and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because only a few sentences in the expected output, such as those about setting the `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties, are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, while many other instructions and introductory statements are not present.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and other topics not related to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output is completely unrelated to the context provided, indicating a high level of hallucination."
