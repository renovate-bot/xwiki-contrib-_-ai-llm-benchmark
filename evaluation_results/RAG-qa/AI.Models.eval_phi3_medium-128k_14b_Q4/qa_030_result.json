  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.10 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are completely irrelevant to the input about configuring spaces in XWiki, with topics ranging from games and developers to weather and culinary creations.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses the scope of configuration display in XWiki administration, the second node explains spaces and sub-pages, and the third node provides information about scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering. None of these nodes address configuring access rights for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses technical details and capabilities of XWiki that do not address the specific requirement of configuring visibility and edit permissions for team spaces.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to align with the context in multiple significant areas, including configuration display options, creation of pages and spaces, and scalability and multi-tenancy capabilities. There are no contradictions, but the lack of alignment justifies the high hallucination score."
