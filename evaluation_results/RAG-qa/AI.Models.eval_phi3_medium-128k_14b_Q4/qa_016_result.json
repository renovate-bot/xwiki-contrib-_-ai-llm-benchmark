  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the customization of user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. However, it includes a link about Scalability and Performance, which is not directly related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.85 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the 'xwiki.cfg' file is used to enable/disable the OpenID Connect provider field and contains a list of all available fields with corresponding comments by OpenID Connect, which is not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is not related to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider. The second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator,' but does not address mapping additional user profile fields. The third node discusses 'XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities,' which are also unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and other unrelated topics, but does not address customizing user profile fields or mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks alignment with the provided contexts, failing to mention key details such as configuration updates, prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, and specific system configurations."
