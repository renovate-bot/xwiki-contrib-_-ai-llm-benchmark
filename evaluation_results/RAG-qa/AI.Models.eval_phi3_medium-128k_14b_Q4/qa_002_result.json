  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.02 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant and do not address the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first node discusses the 'What's New Application' which is not directly related to enabling notifications, and the second node lists various notification preferences macros without providing specific instructions on enabling notifications. The relevant node, which mentions ways to be notified in XWiki, is ranked third.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while the retrieval context supports subscribing to pages or users for notifications (sentence 2), watching a page or its children (sentence 3), and following a user to receive notifications about their events (sentence 4), it does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` (sentence 1) or the 'network' tab in the user profile (sentence 5).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context only provides information about the 'What's New Application' and various notification-related macros in XWiki, but does not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information about the What's New Application, notification preferences, macros, and various notification methods in XWiki, which are essential for factual alignment."
