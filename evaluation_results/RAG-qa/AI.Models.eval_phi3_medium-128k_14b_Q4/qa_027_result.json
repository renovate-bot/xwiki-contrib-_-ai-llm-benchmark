  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.24 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, focusing instead on unrelated topics such as logging hours, project structures, and SQL queries.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly states that configuration should be done in /etc/xwconf_config/.openid.properties, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context, and it also incorrectly claims that authenticated users will have access to all wikis based on roles, whereas the retrieval context specifies that users will not be automatically authenticated on every wiki by default.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities, which are not relevant. The second node focuses on authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration, which does not address the process. The third node mentions OpenID Connect but primarily discusses authentication, dependencies, and limitations without providing specific steps for configuring group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities, which are irrelevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, such as information about XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering capabilities, domain-based instance authentication, session cookies configuration, and specific guides for systems like Lemon LDAP, Keycloak, and Univention Corporate Server."
