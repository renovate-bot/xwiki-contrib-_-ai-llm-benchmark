  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.05 because the output contains numerous irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) that mentions 'the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page' should be ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses Color Themes and various access rights, and the second node explains different rights (comment, edit, delete) and special permissions, neither of which address the specific question about refusing script rights to an administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the information provided in the retrieval context nodes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses Color Themes, icon fonts, and general access rights management, but does not address how to refuse script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks information on several key aspects mentioned in the context, such as Color Themes, icon fonts, Forgot Username and Forgot Password functionality, Comment Right, Edit Right, Delete Right, Special Permissions, Programming Right, Register Right, and Create Wikis Right."
