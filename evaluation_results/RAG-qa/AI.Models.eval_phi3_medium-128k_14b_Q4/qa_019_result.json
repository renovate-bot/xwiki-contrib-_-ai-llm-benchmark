  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.17 because the majority of the statements in the output are irrelevant to the input question about denying script rights to a space administrator. The output contains multiple unrelated issues, meta-statements, and requests for additional information that do not address the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which states 'the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page,' is ranked lower (third node) than the irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses the configuration and implementation of the AuthorizationSettler, and the second node talks about registering and unregistering custom rights, neither of which address the specific question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses the AuthorizationSettler and its configuration, which is not directly related to the question 'Wie kann ich einem Bereichsadministrator das Skriptrecht verweigern?'.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with the provided context. The context is about the configuration and registration of rights within the XWiki platform, but the actual output contains unrelated URLs, unrelated text, and a user query about a different issue."
