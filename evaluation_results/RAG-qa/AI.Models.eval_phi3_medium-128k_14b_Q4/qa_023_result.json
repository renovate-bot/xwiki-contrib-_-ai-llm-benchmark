  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.04 because the majority of the statements are irrelevant, incoherent, and do not address the question about activating notifications for personal actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides links and descriptions of various notification preferences macros but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The second node discusses email notifications, including frequency and grouping, but does not explain how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The third node talks about pre-filtering and post-filtering of notifications but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output, with nodes in the retrieval context aligning well with the details in the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not provide specific instructions or information on how to activate notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks alignment with the context, failing to provide necessary details about notifications macros, email notifications, pre-filtering, post-filtering, REST API, and thread pools as described in the context. There are no contradictions, but the absence of relevant information results in a high hallucination score."
