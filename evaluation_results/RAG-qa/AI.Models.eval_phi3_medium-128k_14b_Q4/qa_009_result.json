  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. However, some parts of the output may still be somewhat related to the topic, which is why the score is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.14 because the relevant node about 'Administration Right' is ranked seventh, while irrelevant nodes discussing 'Programming Right', 'Color Themes', 'Main Wiki Access Rights', 'Comment Right', 'Edit Right', and 'Delete Right' are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various rights and themes unrelated to denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output only provides links to documentation without any specific details, and there are no contradictions present."
