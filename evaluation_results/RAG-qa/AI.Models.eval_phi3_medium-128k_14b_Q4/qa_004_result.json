  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant, incomplete, and nonsensical statements that do not address the question about disabling notifications in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "Fantastic job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first and third nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and ranked higher. However, the second node, which 'only lists various notification preferences macros and does not provide specific instructions on how to disable notifications,' should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, showing a perfect alignment.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the input is perfectly relevant and there are no reasons for irrelevancy. Great job!",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output contains unrelated URLs and incoherent text, providing no relevant information related to the context about filters, notifications, and preferences in XWiki."
