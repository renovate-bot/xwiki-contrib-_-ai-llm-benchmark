  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.04 because the output contains numerous irrelevant statements that do not address the question about configuring XWiki for OpenID Connect. The presence of these irrelevant statements significantly lowers the relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node discusses 'domain-based instance configuration and session cookies,' the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator,' and the third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension.' None of these nodes address the specific configuration needed to enable user accounts upon first login, and they should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not provide any information related to the context, indicating a complete lack of alignment with the provided factual information."
