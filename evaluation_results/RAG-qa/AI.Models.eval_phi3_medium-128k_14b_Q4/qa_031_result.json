  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "Failed to measure after 3 attempts: Evaluation LLM outputted an invalid JSON. Please use a better evaluation model.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which provides detailed information about JWT token generation and its importance for authenticating users with access tokens, is ranked first. The irrelevant nodes, which discuss document management and cookie protection levels, are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while the retrieval context mentions key aspects like JWT tokens, claims, and the Authorization header, it lacks details on enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and the limitation regarding user creation or updating.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context provided is about managing documents in a collection within a wiki and cookie protection strategies, which do not address the use of access tokens for user authentication.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information about JWT tokens, Ed25519 keys, claims required in the token, document handling endpoints, 'remember me' cookie functionality, protection levels, IP address usage, and authentication strategies, which are essential for factual alignment."
