  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.25 because the output contains multiple irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the question about disabling notifications. However, it is not 0 because there might be some relevant content amidst the irrelevant parts.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first and fourth nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and ranked correctly. However, the second node, which is about 'email notifications' and the third node, which discusses 'notification RSS feed,' are irrelevant and should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses notification preferences and email settings but does not provide instructions on how to disable unwanted notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information about notifications, preferences, email notifications, their configuration, RSS feeds, and notification settings, which are all described in the context."
