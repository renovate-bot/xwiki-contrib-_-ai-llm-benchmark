  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.54 because the output contains multiple irrelevant and incorrect statements that do not address the requirement to allow only images and PDFs of a maximum size of 10MB. However, the score is not lower because there are some attempts to provide a solution related to upload restrictions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.71 because the actual output contains several discrepancies: it incorrectly describes the process for restricting attachment types by suggesting the exclusion of PDFs and adding text/plain to the blocked MIME types list, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context. Additionally, it provides an incorrect URL for setting maximum upload size and inaccurately describes the space preferences section for setting storage limits.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node, which is irrelevant, is ranked higher than the second and third nodes. The first node 'describes how to add attachments using different methods but does not address configuring allowed mimetypes or setting maximum attachment size,' while the second node 'mentions configuring blocked attachment mimetypes,' and the third node 'explains how to set the maximum size of an attachment.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.69 because while the retrieval context covers configuring mimetypes and setting maximum attachment size (nodes 2 and 3), it does not explicitly mention ensuring only images or PDF files of a maximum 10MB can be uploaded.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific requirement of limiting uploads to images or PDF files of a maximum of 10MB.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the factual alignments, such as methods of adding attachments, configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, and different methods of uploading attachments, leading to a high hallucination score."
