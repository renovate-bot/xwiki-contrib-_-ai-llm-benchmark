  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because while the answer provides some relevant information about setting up group synchronization with an OpenID Connect provider, it includes several irrelevant details about scalability, performance, caching, OAuth 2.0 login lock, subdirectories, and domain names that do not directly address the process of setting up group synchronization.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.53 because the actual output contains multiple claims not supported by the retrieval context, such as the existence of a 'Synchronization' method for OpenID Connect integration, the location and behavior of the cache, automatic group synchronization on page load, the 'oidc_enabled' property in the xwiki.properties file, adjustments to XWiki's group structure for OpenID Connect, the 'oidcGroupCacheSize' field, automatic deletion of groups for synchronization, and the number of wikis supported on a single JVM.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific process of configuring group synchronization. The second node discusses domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, which is unrelated to the group synchronization process. The third node provides information about XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities, which are not relevant to the specific question of setting up group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the instructions or configurations mentioned in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various unrelated aspects of OpenID Connect and XWiki, such as domain-based authentication, session cookies, and clustering, but does not address the specific question about group synchronization.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the context, and the information provided is aligned with the context."
