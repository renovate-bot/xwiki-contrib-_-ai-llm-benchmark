  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains multiple irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the input query about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'settling access decisions' and 'AuthorizationSettler', the second node talks about 'blocked attachment mimetypes' and 'attachment restrictions', and the third node covers 'checkAccess() method' and 'access violations'. None of these are related to enabling notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses technical details about authorization and access control, which are unrelated to the input query about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not relate to any of the provided contexts, indicating a complete mismatch and thus a high level of hallucination."
