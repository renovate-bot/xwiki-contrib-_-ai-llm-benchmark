  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.04 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant or nonsensical, and do not address the issue with the 'Bell' or 'Alert Notification' extension in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node 'does not address the issue of enabling notifications in the xwiki.properties file', the second node 'does not provide information on enabling notifications in the xwiki.properties file', and the third node 'does not mention the notifications.enabled setting in xwiki.properties'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports all sentences in the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific issue of the 'Bell' in the top right corner not being available even when the 'Alert Notification' extension is installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple key details mentioned in the context, such as the Menu application, Notifications application, Invitation application, installing other features via extensions, the What's New Application, and specific notifications preferences and macros. There are no contradictions, but the omissions result in a high hallucination score."
