  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because while the answer provides some relevant information, it includes multiple irrelevant statements that do not directly address configuring permissions in XWiki as requested.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node explains how spaces and pages are structured in XWiki but does not provide information on configuring access control for teams. The second node is about executing a migration plan and does not relate to configuring access control for teams in XWiki. The third node discusses XAR export functionality and does not provide any information on setting up access control for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address configuring viewing and editing permissions for teams in XWiki, which is the main focus of the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with any of the provided contexts and introduces unrelated instructions about setting up permissions and checking the Solr queue."
