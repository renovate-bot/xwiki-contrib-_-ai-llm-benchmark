    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the top-ranked nodes provide a general introduction to XWiki, explain features of wikis, and describe basic features including access rights management, but none of them address the specific question about configuring access control for teams in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about XWiki and wikis, but it does not address the specific configuration question about team access and editing permissions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output is incoherent and does not align with any of the provided contexts, which discuss various aspects of wikis. There are no contradictions, but the lack of alignment indicates a high level of hallucination."
