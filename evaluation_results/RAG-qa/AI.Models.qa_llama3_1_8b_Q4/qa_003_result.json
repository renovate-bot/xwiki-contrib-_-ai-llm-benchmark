    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant and provides useful information about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, the concluding remark 'That's it!' is slightly irrelevant, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant ones, perfectly addressing the input question. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context fully contains the expected output information about default notification settings and the ability to disable the filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section."
