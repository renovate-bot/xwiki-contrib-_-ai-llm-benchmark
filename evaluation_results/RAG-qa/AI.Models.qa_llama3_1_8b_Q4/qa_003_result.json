    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses general notification settings, the second node lists various notification customization options, the third node is about email feature customization, the fourth node describes different ways to receive notifications, and the fifth node is about overriding default notification templates. None of these nodes address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention that users do not receive notifications about their own activity by default (sentence 1) or the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the user's notification settings (sentence 2).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions notification settings and types but lacks specific details about disabling the filter for one's own activity and advanced filtering options."
