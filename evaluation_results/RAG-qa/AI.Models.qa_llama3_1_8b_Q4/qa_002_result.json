    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) that mentions the 'notifications.enabled' setting in 'xwiki.properties' is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses the visual aspects of notifications, which does not address enabling notifications. Additionally, the second node lists dependencies for the notifications extension, which is unrelated to the process of enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.38 because while the retrieval context supports the mention of enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties' and the alert menu represented by a bell, it lacks information on subscribing to pages or users, watching users, receiving notifications about user events, and the 'network' tab in the user profile.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and the alert menu, but lacks details on subscribing to pages or users and viewing the network tab."
