  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant to the question about not receiving notifications in XWiki, with only a minor irrelevant emotional expression that slightly detracts from a perfect score. Keep up the great work!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, explaining how to ensure notifications are set up correctly by following a user. However, the second and third nodes are irrelevant, as they focus on filtering notifications and obtaining notifications through RSS feeds, which do not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications. The fourth node is relevant, providing an overview of notification methods in XWiki, which helps in understanding how to receive notifications. The presence of these irrelevant nodes ranked higher than some relevant ones is why the score is not higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while several aspects of the expected output, such as watching pages, using the alert menu, following users, and checking the network tab, are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, the crucial initial step of enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and the general concept of subscribing to pages or users are not covered in the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on following users and notification settings, but lacks details on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching pages or wikis."
