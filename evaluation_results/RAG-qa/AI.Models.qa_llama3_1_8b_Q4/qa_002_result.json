  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output incorrectly claims that new users don't watch anything or enable notification types by default, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that in XWiki versions before 15.5, new users have the whole wiki watched by default, and in versions 15.5 and later, all application types are enabled by default.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first and fourth nodes in the retrieval context are relevant, addressing how to receive notifications in XWiki, and are ranked higher. However, the second node, which discusses 'filters and settings related to notifications but does not directly address enabling notifications or subscribing to content', and the third node, which 'describes obtaining an RSS feed for notifications, which is not directly related to enabling notifications or subscribing to content', are ranked higher than the fourth relevant node. Additionally, the fifth node, which 'describes the 'What's New' application, which is not directly related to enabling notifications or subscribing to content', is ranked lower, which is correct.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context covers aspects like enabling notifications through the 'alert' menu, following users, and using the 'network' tab (as seen in node 1), it lacks information about enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties`, subscribing to pages or users, and watching a page or its children.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers user following and notification settings but lacks explicit mention of enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or watching pages and wikis.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions watching users and enabling notifications but lacks details on enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties' and the specific process of subscribing to pages or users. It also does not mention the 'alert' menu and 'network' tab."
