  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is mostly relevant and helpful in addressing the OpenID Connect configuration issue, but it includes an unnecessary reference to LDAP authentication, which slightly detracts from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly states that OIDC authentication does not automatically enable user accounts upon their first login by default, whereas the retrieval context indicates that user accounts should indeed be enabled on first login by default in OIDC configuration.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which mentions the property 'oidc.enableUser=true' directly related to enabling user accounts on first login, is ranked first. Irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing domain-based authentication and session cookies (second node), general OpenID Connect information (third node), container authentication and Active Directory (fourth node), and LDAP configuration (fifth node), are ranked lower. Great job on the perfect ranking!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context nodes provide information on defining and setting the 'oidc.enableUser' property (related to sentences 1, 2, and 3), they lack details on saving the file, restarting XWiki, and the automatic enabling of user accounts (related to sentences 4 and 5).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the relevant information about the 'oidc.enableUser' property, but lacks explicit instructions to uncomment and set it to 'true', save the file, and restart the XWiki instance.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly mentions setting `oidc.enableUser` to `true` to enable accounts at first login, aligning with the expected output's key fact. However, it refers to modifying `<XWIKI_HOME>/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg` instead of `xwiki.properties`, and lacks mention of restarting the XWiki instance, which are discrepancies."
