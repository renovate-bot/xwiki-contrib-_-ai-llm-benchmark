  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes an irrelevant mention of LDAP authentication, which slightly detracts from the focus on OpenID Connect.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions the property '# oidc.enableUser=true' directly related to enabling user accounts on first login, is ranked first. All irrelevant nodes, discussing topics like domain-based authentication and cookie settings, general OpenID Connect information, and LDAP authentication, are ranked lower. Great job on getting it spot-on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context supports the configuration details in sentences 1 and 2 of the expected output through node 1 in the retrieval context, it lacks information on saving the file, restarting XWiki, and the automatic enabling of new user accounts as mentioned in sentences 4 and 5.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the key information about the 'oidc.enableUser' property, including its purpose and default setting, which aligns with the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions on saving the file and restarting XWiki."
