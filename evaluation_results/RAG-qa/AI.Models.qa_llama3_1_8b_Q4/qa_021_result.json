  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the response is highly relevant to the input, addressing the issue of the alert bell not being available. However, it includes a link to XWiki syntax documentation, which is not related to solving the problem, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior', which is unrelated to the issue of enabling notifications in the wiki settings. Similarly, the second node lists 'various notification settings and customization options' without addressing the enabling of notifications. The third node provides 'links to various notification preferences', which does not help with the enabling issue. The fourth node describes 'the notification application and its features', but again, does not mention enabling notifications. Finally, the fifth node talks about 'RSS feeds and notification settings', which is not relevant to the problem of enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence can be linked to the 5th node in the retrieval context, which talks about displaying notifications on the wiki. However, the second sentence lacks support as there is no information in the retrieval context about setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, which are key details in the expected output."
