  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help solve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node 'primarily lists features and links related to the Notifications Application' but does not offer guidance on enabling notifications. The second node 'describes various settings and filters for notifications' without addressing the specific need to enable notifications. The third node talks about 'getting an RSS feed and using the Notifications Macro' but lacks instructions on enabling notifications. Lastly, the fourth node 'lists various notification preferences macros' without providing actionable steps on enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while most aspects of enabling notifications and following users or pages are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specific details like setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' and the 'r\u00e9seau' tab for viewing followed users are not mentioned.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting 'notifications.enabled' to true and specific steps for following pages or users.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not match key facts such as enabling notifications via xwiki.properties or following users/pages. It provides different steps and lacks detailed guidance on following users or pages."
