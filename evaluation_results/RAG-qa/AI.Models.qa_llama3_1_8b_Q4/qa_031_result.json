  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the response addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to the answer.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mixed with irrelevant ones. For example, the first node discusses 'LDAP configuration, which is not relevant to token-based authentication,' yet it is ranked higher than the second node, which 'explains how to configure authorized applications, relevant to using access tokens for authentication.' Similarly, the third node about 'OpenID Connect scopes and response types' is not directly related to the input and is ranked higher than the fourth node, which 'describes the use of JSON Web Tokens for authentication,' directly relating to token-based authentication. This mix of relevant and irrelevant nodes affects the precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key aspects of the expected output, such as the use of JWT for authentication and the configuration of authorized applications, are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specific details like generating a JWT token with required claims and including it in the 'Authorization' header are not explicitly mentioned in any node.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms the use of JWT for authentication and mentions configuring authorized applications, matching the expected answer. However, it lacks specific details on JWT claims and token inclusion in the request header.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly mentions configuring the xwiki.authentication.authclass property for token-based authentication and using JWT, but it omits details about the required claims in the token and Ed25519 signing key. It also lacks information on configuring authorized applications and the specific use of the 'Authorization' header."
