  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response mostly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes multiple irrelevant source links and a non-technical comment that detract from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'LDAP authentication settings', which is unrelated to token-based authentication, yet it is ranked higher than the second node, which provides relevant information on 'configuring authorized applications' for JWTs. Similarly, the third node about 'OpenID Connect scopes' is not directly related to JWT-based authentication and is ranked higher than the fourth node, which directly supports the expected output by describing functionality for authenticating users with JWTs.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.86 because most of the expected output is well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, particularly regarding the use of JWT tokens and configuration steps. However, the specific detail about including the token in the 'Authorization' header is not directly mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains most of the expected answer details, such as enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and the limitation on user creation. However, it lacks specific mention of JWT claims and the Ed25519 signing key."
