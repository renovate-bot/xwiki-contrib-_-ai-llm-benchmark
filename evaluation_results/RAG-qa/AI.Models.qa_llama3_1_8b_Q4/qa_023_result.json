  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response mostly addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it includes irrelevant links that do not directly help solve the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the first node in the retrieval context directly addresses the input question with 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' while the subsequent nodes discuss unrelated topics like 'RSS feeds and general notification settings,' 'links and headings related to notifications,' 'various notification preferences and macros,' and 'technical aspects of notifications,' which do not specifically address the issue of receiving notifications for one's own actions. Great job on ranking the relevant information first!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, showing a perfect match. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the ability to change this setting, aligning closely with the expected output. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides steps to enable notifications for one's own actions, aligning partially with the expected output's mention of notifications for personal activities. However, it lacks the detail about the default settings and the specific 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section."
