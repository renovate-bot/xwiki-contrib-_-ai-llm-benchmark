  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.44 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements about enabling notifications in Discord and Twitter, which do not address the user's question about enabling notifications for their own actions. However, some parts of the response may still be somewhat related to the topic of notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying true to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics such as RSS feeds, notification settings, notification preferences, overriding templates, and ways to receive notifications, none of which address enabling notifications for one's own activity. Therefore, all irrelevant nodes are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially aligns with the expected output, specifically regarding the filtering of one's own events, but it lacks information on disabling the filter and advanced filtering options.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that users can filter their own events and adjust notification settings, but it does not specify that users do not receive notifications about their own activity by default or how to disable this filter in advanced settings."
