  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the response mostly addresses how to disable notifications, but it includes irrelevant links that do not directly help with the question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are perfectly ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The first three nodes effectively address 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode', 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', and 'Auto Watch', which are directly related to the input query about modifying notification settings. The irrelevant node, which discusses 'RSS feeds and general notification settings', is appropriately ranked last.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, aligning with the expected answer about automatic page following and filter management. However, it lacks explicit mention of modifying auto-watch settings in user profile notification settings.",
    "Correctness": "The Actual Output focuses on disabling unwanted notifications, which is unrelated to the Expected Output's topic of automatic page following and notification settings. No key facts align with the Expected Output."
