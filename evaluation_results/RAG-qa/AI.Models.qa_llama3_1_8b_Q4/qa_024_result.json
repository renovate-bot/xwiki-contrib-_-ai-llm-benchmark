  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the main content effectively addresses how to disable notifications, but the inclusion of source links that don't directly answer the question slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The first three nodes provide information directly related to modifying notification settings and auto-watch preferences, which aligns perfectly with the input query. The irrelevant node, which discusses RSS feeds and notification types, is correctly ranked last, ensuring a perfect score. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because most of the expected output sentences are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specifically regarding auto-watched mode and notification preferences in nodes 1 and 2. However, the sentence about being notified of changes lacks explicit support in the retrieval context, which affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and custom filters, aligning with the expected answer's mention of automatic page following and custom filter settings. However, it lacks explicit details about modifying the 'Suivi automatique des pages' setting in user profile notification settings."
