  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the response mostly addresses the question about setting upload restrictions for attachments, but it includes irrelevant links to pages about exporting features, XWiki syntax, and document lifecycle features, which do not pertain to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides 'detailed steps for setting the maximum size of an attachment and mentions mimetype restriction', is ranked fifth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'trusted domains and PDF export look and feel', the second node about 'ODT and PDF export features', and the third node listing 'various macros and features related to notifications, PDF viewing, and other functionalities', are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.73 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context provides comprehensive details and steps related to configuring the maximum attachment size, aligning well with sentences in the expected output, there is no information in the nodes about configuring MIME types or editing the xwiki.properties file, which are essential parts of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details about setting MIME types in xwiki.properties and the exact steps to set the size to 10 MB."
