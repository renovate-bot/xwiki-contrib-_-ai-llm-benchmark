  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes a URL that does not directly address the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics such as 'group synchronization', 'template customization', 'event listeners for OpenID Connect', 'protection levels for cookies', 'security strategies for failed logins', 'Kerberos SSO Authentication', 'LDAP group mapping', 'mail templates for password reset and username retrieval', and 'custom claims for OpenID Connect', which are not relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any information in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication for the LLM application (BETA) extension, JWT tokens, or the specific steps for enabling and configuring the token authenticator."
