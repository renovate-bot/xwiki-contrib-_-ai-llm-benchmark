  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because the output partially addresses the question about configuring access and editing rights in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant statements related to other features and functionalities, which do not directly help in solving the specific problem presented.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses XWiki's use of relational databases and programming features, which is not relevant to configuring access control for teams. The second node is about notifications and application details in XWiki, which does not relate to setting access permissions for teams. The third node describes using nested pages and subwikis in XWiki, which is not directly related to configuring team-specific access rights. The fourth node mentions managing users and groups but lacks specific information on configuring access control for teams to view and edit areas. Lastly, the fifth node involves group synchronization and customization, which does not directly address the question of configuring team-specific access rights in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only sentences 1 and 2 in the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specifically node 4, which mentions managing users and groups and setting user rights. The rest of the sentences, including area-level rights, inheriting rights, and summary statements, are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about creating groups, setting wiki-wide or area-specific rights, or inheriting rights for subpages, which are all key components of the expected answer."
