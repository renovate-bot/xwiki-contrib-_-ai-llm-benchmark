  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes repetitive irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the specific configuration question about team access and editing permissions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the claim states that the Test-Benutzer or an Administrator should have no special rights for the area, but the context does not mention this restriction.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics such as 'creating children pages and changing page access rights' (first node), 'what a wiki is and how to manage panels' (second node), 'various macros and their uses' (third node), 'applications and extensions in XWiki' (fourth node), and 'language preferences and translations in XWiki' (fifth node), none of which are relevant to configuring team-specific access control in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain specific steps for creating groups, setting wiki-wide and area-specific rights, or inheriting rights for subpages as outlined in the expected output."
