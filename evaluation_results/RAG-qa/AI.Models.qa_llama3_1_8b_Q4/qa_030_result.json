  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response mostly addresses the question about configuring spaces in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant statements providing source links that do not directly answer the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses the structure of an XML page in XWiki, which does not relate to configuring access rights for teams. The second node talks about sending representations and modifying resources, which is not directly related to configuring team access rights. The third node is about managing comments and attachments, which is not relevant to setting up access rights for teams. The fourth node explains spaces and sub-pages but does not provide information on configuring access rights. The fifth node lists actions for running a migrator and handling space names, which is unrelated to configuring team access rights. Finally, the sixth node discusses configuration display scopes, which does not address setting up access rights for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to creating groups, defining rights, or inheriting rights as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output discusses creating user groups and setting permissions but lacks clarity and detail on setting 'Afficher' rights for 'XWikiAllGroup' and inheriting rights for child pages, which are key points in the expected output. It also introduces unnecessary technical details not present in the expected output."
