  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the provided URL does not directly address the question about configuring access in XWiki, leading to repeated irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node explains the technical details of how pages and spaces are created and managed in XWiki, but it does not provide information on setting access controls for different teams. Similarly, the second node lists various macros and their purposes in XWiki, which is not relevant to configuring access controls for team spaces.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention any of the specific steps or details outlined in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, defining rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages."
