  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant and provides a clear explanation on customizing user profile fields in XWiki. However, it includes source links that do not directly address the input question, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints' but lacks information on 'user profile field mapping or customization in xwiki.properties'. The second node is about 'container authentication and other authentication methods', not addressing 'mapping user profile fields from OpenID Connect to XWiki properties'. The third node provides 'configuration guides for OpenID Connect with various systems', without mentioning 'mapping user profile fields or customizing them in xwiki.properties'. The fourth node introduces the 'OpenID Connect Authenticator' but does not discuss 'user profile field mapping or customization in xwiki.properties'. Finally, the fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension' but lacks details on 'user profile field mapping or customization in xwiki.properties'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context nodes provide information on customizing user profile fields and saving changes in `xwiki.properties`, they lack explicit details on example mappings and instructions for replacing placeholders, which are necessary to fully support the expected output sentences.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information on customizing user profile fields in 'xwiki.properties' using 'oidc.user.mapping', which is detailed in the expected output."
