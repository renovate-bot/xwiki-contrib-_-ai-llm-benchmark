  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is largely relevant to the input, but it includes a source link that does not directly address the issue of the bell not being available, slightly lowering the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is ranked sixth, mentions that administrators can edit the xwiki.properties file to enable notifications by setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true'. However, the first five nodes are irrelevant as they discuss topics like custom notification filters, the Alert menu, different ways to receive notifications, and notification settings, but do not address enabling notifications or the 'notifications.enabled' setting. This misranking of irrelevant nodes higher than the relevant one results in a low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context includes information about editing the xwiki.properties file (node 5), it does not explicitly mention setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is a key part of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`."
