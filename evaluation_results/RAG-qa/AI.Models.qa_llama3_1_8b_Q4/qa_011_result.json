  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of the unavailable bell icon, but it includes a source link that doesn't directly address the problem, slightly reducing its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output incorrectly states that the Bell-Button is unavailable after installing the 'Notifications Application' extension, contradicting the retrieval context which indicates that this application adds a bell icon to the Alert menu in the top bar.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in retrieval context, ranked sixth, discusses 'editing the xwiki.properties file', which is crucial for 'enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`'. However, it is ranked lower than five irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior', which is unrelated to the input about enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions editing the xwiki.properties file, it does not explicitly state setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is a key part of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties` as required, and instead provides troubleshooting steps unrelated to the expected output."
