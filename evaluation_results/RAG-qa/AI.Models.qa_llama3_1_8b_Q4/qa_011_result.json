    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the issue without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about getting a notification RSS feed and does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings, which should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` or provide any information about setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
