  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant to the input question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using OpenID Connect. However, it includes a source reference that, while informative, does not directly address the customization query, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output claims a specific mapping method 'oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}' which is not mentioned in the retrieval context, indicating a slight misalignment.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which includes information about mapping non-standard properties from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties, is ranked first. This directly addresses the input query about customizing user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because the retrieval context supports most of the expected output, particularly the customization of user profile fields and mapping examples, as seen in the 1st node in retrieval context. However, it lacks explicit information about saving the file and restarting XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all information from the expected answer, including customization of user profile fields via the oidc.user.mapping property in xwiki.properties and examples of mapping custom properties.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output accurately reflects the expected output, covering customization of user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping`. It provides examples similar to those in the expected output. The additional information about multiple mappings adds value without factual errors. The mention of `oidc.user.nameFormater` is extra but factually correct, causing a minor deduction."
