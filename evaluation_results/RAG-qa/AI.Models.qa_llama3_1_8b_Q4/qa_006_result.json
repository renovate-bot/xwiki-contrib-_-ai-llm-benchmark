  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the output provides relevant information on customizing user profile fields in XWiki, but it includes several irrelevant statements that do not directly address the process of mapping additional fields from the OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node in the retrieval context is relevant as it mentions 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and provides an example of how to map these properties, which directly relates to customizing user profile fields. This ensures that the relevant information is prioritized, resulting in a perfect score. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports most of the expected output by discussing the customization of user profile fields and providing a similar example of mapping properties. However, it lacks information about saving the 'xwiki.properties' file and restarting XWiki, which affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes the exact information from the expected output about mapping user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, along with examples and instructions to save and restart XWiki."
