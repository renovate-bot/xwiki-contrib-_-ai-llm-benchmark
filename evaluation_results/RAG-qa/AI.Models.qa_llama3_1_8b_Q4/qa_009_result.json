  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the response mostly addresses how to deny script rights to a space administrator, but includes an irrelevant statement about nested pages migration, which slightly detracts from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'programming rights and script execution' but doesn't address denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node provides a 'table of rights and their properties' without mentioning the denial of script rights. The third node explains 'script right and its default settings' but lacks information on denying these rights. The fourth node contains 'code snippets related to access checks' without addressing the denial of script rights. Lastly, the fifth node discusses 'converting rights and excluding pages' but is unrelated to denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the node in the retrieval context. Great job on achieving complete alignment!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, aligning with the expected output. However, it does not explicitly state that XWiki does not support denying such rights.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output incorrectly states that script rights can be denied to a space administrator, which contradicts the expected output stating it is not supported in XWiki."
