  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but includes irrelevant information such as a link about content organization and a statement that does not provide guidance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'programming rights and script execution but does not address the inability to deny rights implied by admin rights.' Similarly, the second node lists 'various rights and their properties but does not mention the inability to deny rights that are implied by admin rights.' Each node is unrelated to the input query about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The expected answer states that rights implied by admin right cannot be denied, which is confirmed by the retrieval context indicating that admin rights are 'not deniable' and imply other rights such as LOGIN, VIEW, EDIT, DELETE, REGISTER, COMMENT, SCRIPT."
