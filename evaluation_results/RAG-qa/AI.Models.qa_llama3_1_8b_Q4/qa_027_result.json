  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the third node, 'explicitly mentions group synchronization, the use of claims in the xwiki.properties file, and the oidc.groups.mapping property, which are relevant to the expected output.' However, it is ranked lower than the first and second nodes, which 'discuss authentication management and endpoints related to OpenID Connect, but do not address group synchronization specifically,' and 'mention various authentication methods and extensions, but do not provide information on configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect,' respectively. This lowers the precision score as irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than the relevant one.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.92 because most instructions in the expected output, such as configuring 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', are supported by the 3rd node in the retrieval context. However, the retrieval context does not explicitly mention saving the xwiki.properties file and restarting XWiki, which affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping but lacks specific details about oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator properties, which are crucial in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks specific instructions on setting `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.separator` found in the expected output. It introduces new concepts like `oidc.userinfoclaims` and listeners which are not mentioned in the expected output. The mapping of groups is addressed but with different format details."
