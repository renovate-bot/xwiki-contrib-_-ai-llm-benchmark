  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'group synchronization and the use of the `oidc.groups.mapping` property', is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node that 'primarily discusses authentication management and endpoints configuration', and the second node that 'talks about container authentication and other authentication methods', are ranked higher than the relevant node. This misranking results in a lower score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because while the 3rd node in retrieval context supports the general idea of configuring group synchronization in XWiki, it lacks specific details found in the expected output, such as locating the 'xwiki.properties' file, providing examples for 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', and instructions on saving and restarting XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using 'oidc.groups.mapping', but lacks details on 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.separator'."
