  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because while the response contains several URLs to documentation and extensions that do not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications, it still provides some relevant information related to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various XWiki applications and extensions' which are not related to enabling notifications. The second node talks about 'access rights and executing tasks with specific user rights,' which is also not relevant. Similarly, the third node is about 'scripting macros and link renaming,' the fourth node describes 'properties of a collection in an AI application,' and the fifth node is about 'configuring permissions for guests in an open wiki,' none of which pertain to enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about enabling notifications or following pages and users as described in the expected output."
