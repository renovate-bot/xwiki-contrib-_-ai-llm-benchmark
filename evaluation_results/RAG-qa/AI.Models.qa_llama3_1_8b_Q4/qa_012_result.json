  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes a source link that is not directly related to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node contains 'image links and references that do not relate to notifications or their settings', the second node also includes 'image links and references unrelated to the topic of enabling notifications', and the third node similarly has 'image links and references that are not relevant to the issue of receiving notifications'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, which only contain image links and references unrelated to the content about notifications and following users or pages.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to enabling notifications or following pages/users as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output discusses issues with skins and system errors, which are unrelated to the expected steps for enabling notifications by following pages or users and setting configurations."
