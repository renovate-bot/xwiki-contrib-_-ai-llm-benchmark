  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the response addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the query, slightly detracting from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node in the retrieval context, which is about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki,' is irrelevant to script rights and administrative permissions, yet it is ranked higher than relevant nodes. Additionally, the fourth node, which discusses 'checking access rights programmatically,' and the fifth node, focusing on 'executing code with specific user rights,' are also irrelevant to the input question and are ranked higher than they should be. However, the second and third nodes are relevant as they discuss 'programming and script rights' and specify that 'ADMIN rights are not deniable,' which supports the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context, specifically by the 3rd node, which confirms that admin rights are not deniable. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that ADMIN rights imply other rights and are not deniable, but does not explicitly state that administrator rights cannot be refused as in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output contradicts the expected output by stating that script rights can be denied to a space admin, whereas the expected output states admin rights cannot be refused."
