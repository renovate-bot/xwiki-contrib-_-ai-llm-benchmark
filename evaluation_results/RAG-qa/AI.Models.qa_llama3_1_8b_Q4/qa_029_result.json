  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.60 because the response partially addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but includes irrelevant information such as a source link about internationalization features and a statement indicating an inability to assist, which do not directly answer the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context is relevant, discussing 'programming and script rights' and how 'script rights are allowed unless explicitly revoked', which aligns with the input query. However, the first node, which is ranked higher, is irrelevant as it talks about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', not related to script rights or administrative permissions. Additionally, the third node, which is also irrelevant, 'lists various rights and their default states' without addressing the specific issue of refusing script rights to an administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the information from the node in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that certain rights like ADMIN are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that administrator rights cannot be refused as in the expected output."
