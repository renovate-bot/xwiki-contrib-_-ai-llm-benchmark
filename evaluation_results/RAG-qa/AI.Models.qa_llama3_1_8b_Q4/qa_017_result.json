  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect provider configuration', but not group synchronization. The second node focuses on 'authentication delegation' without mentioning group synchronization. The third node gives a 'general description of OpenID Connect authentication' but lacks details on group synchronization. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', which is not relevant to group synchronization. Lastly, the fifth node provides 'metadata about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', but does not address group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, as all instructions and examples provided in the expected output are not found or detailed in the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks specific details about configuring group synchronization properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' found in the expected output."
