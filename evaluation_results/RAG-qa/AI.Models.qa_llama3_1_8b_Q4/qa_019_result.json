  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the response partially addresses the input question, but includes irrelevant statements such as source links and an expression of inability to help, which do not directly answer the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'form validation and JavaScript patterns', the second node is about 'template providers and page creation', and the third node covers 'configuration classes and custom rights checks', none of which relate to denying script rights to an admin in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output discusses rights and permissions in XWiki, which are not mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about XWiki's admin rights or their limitations, which is the main focus of the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides contradictory information by suggesting steps to restrict rights, which the expected output claims cannot be denied. It also includes extraneous details about role creation and configuration, not present in the expected output."
