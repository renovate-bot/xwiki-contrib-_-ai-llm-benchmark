  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer mostly addresses the configuration question in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to solving the problem, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.67 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, discussing 'rights inheritance and administration features' in XWiki, which aligns with setting view and edit permissions. However, the second and third nodes are irrelevant, focusing on 'parent/child relationship and Nested Pages' and 'string formatting and user identification in OpenID Connect', respectively, which do not address the configuration of permissions. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than the fourth and sixth nodes, which are relevant as they provide information on 'XWiki's permission system' and 'rules for setting rights in XWiki'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because most of the expected output sentences are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as node 4 aligning with sentences 1, 2, and 3, and node 1 aligning with sentence 4. However, the summary sentences are not directly covered by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights at different levels and the concept of rights inheritance, which aligns partially with the expected answer's steps on setting wiki-wide and space-level rights. However, it lacks specific details about creating groups for each team and setting rights specifically for team spaces as outlined in the expected answer."
