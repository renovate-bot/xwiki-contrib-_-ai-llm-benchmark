  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.72 because the response addresses the main concern of disabling notifications effectively, but the repeated inclusion of unrelated source links slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'attaching files', the second node is about 'moving attachments', the third node lists 'various macros', the fourth node covers 'administrating wiki features', and the fifth node talks about 'extensions and applications'. None of these relate to notification settings or how to manage them, which is the focus of the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic page following or notification settings mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides instructions on disabling notifications and references sources unrelated to the expected content about automatic tracking and notification settings."
