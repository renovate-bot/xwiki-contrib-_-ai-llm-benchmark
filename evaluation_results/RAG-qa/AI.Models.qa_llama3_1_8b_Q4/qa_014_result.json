  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the main content effectively addresses the question about disabling notifications, but it includes several irrelevant source links related to various XWiki topics that do not pertain to the input query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'attaching files' which does not mention notifications or settings related to them. Similarly, the second node is about 'moving attachments', which is unrelated to notification settings. None of the nodes address the issue of managing or deactivating notifications, leading to a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic following of pages, notification settings, or custom filters as mentioned in the expected output."
