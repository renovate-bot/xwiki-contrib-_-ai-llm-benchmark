  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the answer provides relevant information about disabling notifications but includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'Verbatim' and 'Quotations' features in XWiki Syntax, which are unrelated to notification settings. The second node describes an extension for authenticating users with JSON Web Tokens, which is not relevant to disabling notifications. Additionally, the third node lists various resources and API endpoints for managing collections and documents in the LLM Application, which do not pertain to notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic page following, notification settings, or custom filters as mentioned in the expected output."
