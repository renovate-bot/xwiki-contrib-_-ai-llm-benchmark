  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first three nodes provide detailed information on configuring group synchronization, such as setting the `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.mapping`, and `oidc.groups.separator` properties. The fourth node, ranked lower, is more about general information on authenticating with an OpenID Connect provider, and the fifth node discusses authentication management without specific details on group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because only specific configuration details from the expected output, such as setting the 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' properties, are supported by nodes in the retrieval context. General instructions and introductory steps are not directly supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes configuring 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', matching the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit instructions to save and restart XWiki."
