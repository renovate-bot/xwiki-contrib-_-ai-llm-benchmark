  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the output mostly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect, but contains some irrelevant statements that slightly detract from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly states that setting `oidc.skipped` to `false` ignores OpenID Connect, while the retrieval context indicates that OpenID Connect can be disabled using the property `oidc.skipped`.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', which does not relate to 'automatic activation of user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect'. The second node provides a 'general description of OpenID Connect authentication' without mentioning the specific property `oidc.enableUser` or its configuration in `xwiki.properties`. The third node includes 'metadata and compatibility information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator' but does not address the needed configuration. Lastly, the fourth node mentions the `xwiki.properties` file but lacks reference to the `oidc.enableUser` property or the necessary configuration for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the 4th node in retrieval context supports the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and 'oidc.enableUser' for automatic user account activation, it lacks specific instructions on updating the property, saving the file, and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions xwiki.properties but lacks details on enabling oidc.enableUser for auto-activation of accounts.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions modifying `xwiki.cfg` and `oidc.skipped` which are not in the expected output. It misses adjusting `xwiki.properties` and `oidc.enableUser`. Context of automatic activation is maintained but with incorrect steps."
