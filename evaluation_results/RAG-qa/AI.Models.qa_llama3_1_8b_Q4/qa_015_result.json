  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node only provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, and the second node mentions prerequisites and installation instructions but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' in the 2nd node in the retrieval context supports the expected output, while the rest of the detailed instructions and outcomes are not covered.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
