  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly claims that XWiki allows users to subscribe to notifications on various events by default, whereas the retrieval context specifies that notifications are only sent by default when users are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Watch and custom filters' and is directly related to managing notification settings, is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes discussing enabling/disabling the notification module at the server level (first node), getting an RSS feed of notifications (second node), clearing and grouping notifications (fourth node), and choosing the default frequency and level of details for notification emails (fifth node) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and custom filters but lacks details on automatic page watching and changing settings in the user profile."
