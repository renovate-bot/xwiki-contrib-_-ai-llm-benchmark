  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response effectively addresses the OpenID Connect configuration question, but includes irrelevant details about LDAP Authenticator and a general hope statement, which slightly detract from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For instance, the first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which does not relate to 'enabling user accounts automatically upon first login using OpenID Connect.' Similarly, the second node mentions 'container authentication and other authentication methods like LDAP,' but fails to address the specific configuration for OpenID Connect. Additionally, the third node, despite discussing OpenID Connect, lacks 'specific instructions about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file to enable user accounts automatically.' Thus, none of the nodes provide relevant information for the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the xwiki.properties file or the specific property oidc.enableUser for activating user accounts via OpenID Connect."
