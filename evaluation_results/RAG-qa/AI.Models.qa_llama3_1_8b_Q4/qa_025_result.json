  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the main question about configuring OpenID Connect for automatic user activation. However, it includes a statement about the XWiki RESTful API, which is not directly related to the specific configuration issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job on maintaining faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For instance, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, such as its developer and compatibility, but does not address the specific configuration needed. Similarly, the second node discusses container authentication and mentions OpenID Connect Authentication but lacks details on automatic user activation. The third node mentions automatic synchronization but not the specific instructions needed. The fourth node discusses various authentication methods for the XWiki RESTful API without providing the required configuration details. Lastly, the fifth node lists endpoints and customization options without addressing the specific configuration needed for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or setting the `oidc.enableUser` property."
