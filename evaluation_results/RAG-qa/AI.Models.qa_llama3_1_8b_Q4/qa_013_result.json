  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.55 because the output includes several irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, the score is not lower because some relevant information is likely provided.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about 'JWT token generation and its claims', the second node discusses 'database migration and invalid extensions', and the third node lists 'various XWiki extensions such as Office Importer and Syntax Highlighting'. These topics do not relate to notifications about user activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention notifications, user activity, 'Erweiterte Filteroptionen', or user notification settings in the user profile.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to notification settings or user activity filters as mentioned in the expected output."
