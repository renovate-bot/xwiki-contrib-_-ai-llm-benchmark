  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a statement about XWiki syntax that is not directly related to configuring file upload restrictions and a vague statement that lacks specific guidance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node explaining how to set limits on the maximum size of an attachment is ranked first, while all irrelevant nodes discussing topics like moving attachments, whitelisting mimetypes, and linking to external files are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.45 because while the retrieval context covers the steps to set the maximum attachment size in the XWikiPreferences document (sentences 7-11), it does not mention configuring allowed mimetypes or editing the `xwiki.properties` configuration file (sentences 1-6).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring the maximum size of an attachment and setting mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details about setting the mimetype in `xwiki.properties` and the exact byte value for 10MB."
