    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked third, provides information on setting the maximum size of an attachment and mentions the configuration parameter in the XWikiPreferences document, which is directly related to configuring upload restrictions. However, the first and second nodes are irrelevant as they discuss linking to external files and images, and the structure of XWiki pages, which do not pertain to configuring upload restrictions for images or PDFs. Additionally, the fourth and fifth nodes are also irrelevant, focusing on attachment display, download, security settings, and versioning, which do not address configuring upload restrictions for specific file types or sizes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.64 because while the retrieval context nodes provide detailed steps for configuring maximum attachment size (node 3) and reference the configuration of mimetype restrictions (node 4), they do not directly cover the overall instruction to ensure only images or PDFs of max 10MB can be uploaded, nor do they include the specific line for mimetype restrictions.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions, but lacks specifics on configuring 'xwiki.properties' for mimetypes and setting size to 10MB."
