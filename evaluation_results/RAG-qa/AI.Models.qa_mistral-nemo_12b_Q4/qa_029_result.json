  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response partially addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but includes several irrelevant links that do not directly answer the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because relevant nodes discussing programming and script rights in XWiki, such as the second node stating 'programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page,' and the third node noting 'ADMIN' is 'not deniable,' are ranked after an irrelevant first node about language preferences and translations. Additionally, irrelevant nodes like the fourth node on checking access rights programmatically and the fifth node about executing code with specific user rights are ranked too closely to relevant nodes, which affects the precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context, specifically supported by the 3rd node in retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that programming and admin rights are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that admin rights cannot be refused, as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output claims script rights can be refused to space admin, contradicting expected output that admin rights can't be refused."
