  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response addresses the main question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the input question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context is relevant, discussing the 'Script' right and its denial, which aligns with the input. However, the first node is irrelevant as it focuses on 'language preferences and translations in XWiki,' which should be ranked lower. Additionally, the third node, which 'lists various rights and their default states,' is also irrelevant and should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the information in the retrieval context, showing a clear understanding of XWiki's rights management. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that certain rights like ADMIN are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that administrator rights cannot be refused, which is the main point of the expected output."
