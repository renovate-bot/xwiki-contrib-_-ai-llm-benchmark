  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes a source link that does not directly address the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job maintaining accuracy!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node contains 'image links and references that are unrelated to the topic of notifications or their settings.' Similarly, the second node is 'a list of image links and references, which do not provide any information about enabling notifications or related settings.' The third node also consists of 'image links and references, which are not relevant to the issue of receiving notifications or their configuration.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, which only contain image links and references.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains image links and references unrelated to the expected answer about enabling notifications and following users or pages in XWiki.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention enabling notifications via 'xwiki.properties' or following pages/users as stated in the expected output, and includes irrelevant information about email settings and server issues."
