  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about disabling notifications in XWiki without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'how to get a notification RSS feed and general notification settings', which does not address disabling notifications or automatic page watching. The second node is about 'following a user and default watch settings', which also does not mention disabling notifications or adjusting automatic page watching settings. Subsequent nodes similarly fail to address the specific issue of disabling notifications or automatic page watching, focusing instead on unrelated aspects like 'filters for notifications', 'enabling or disabling email notifications', 'administrator settings', and 'overriding default notification templates'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings but lacks details on automatic page watching and deleting notification filters.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output discusses managing notification settings but lacks specifics on 'automatic page watching' and 'deleting custom filters' from the expected output."
