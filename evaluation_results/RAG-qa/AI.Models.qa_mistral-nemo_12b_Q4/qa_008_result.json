  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer provides relevant information about file uploads but includes several irrelevant URLs and an assumption about using MediaWiki, which may not apply to the general question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which mentions 'As an administrator you can set limits on the maximum size of an attachment' and provides steps to change the maximum upload size in the XWikiPreferences document, is ranked first, while all irrelevant nodes discussing topics such as moving attachments, deleting attachments, linking to files, and backlinks indexation are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context covers the steps to set the maximum attachment size (sentences 7-12), it does not mention configuring allowed mimetypes (sentences 1-6).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes steps to configure maximum attachment size and mentions mimetype restrictions, but lacks specific details on configuring allowed mimetypes in xwiki.properties and the exact value for 10MB in bytes."
