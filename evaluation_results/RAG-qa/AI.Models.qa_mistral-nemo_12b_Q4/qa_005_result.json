  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes links to the XWiki RESTful API documentation and XWiki Access Rights documentation, which are not directly related to configuring automatic user account enabling upon first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator,' the second node 'mentions OpenID Connect Authentication' but lacks specific configuration details, and the third node 'discusses various authentication methods' without addressing the required configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about adjusting the xwiki.properties file or setting the oidc.enableUser property to true."
