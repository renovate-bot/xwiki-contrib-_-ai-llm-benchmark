  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the output is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, with only a minor mention of LDAP Authenticator, which is not directly related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the first node in the retrieval context is highly relevant, mentioning the property 'oidc.enableUser=true', which is directly related to enabling user accounts on first login. All irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing 'domain-based authentication and session cookies' (second node), 'general information about OpenID Connect' (third node), 'container authentication and LDAP' (fourth node), and 'LDAP configuration' (fifth node), are appropriately ranked lower. Great job on achieving perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context includes information about enabling user accounts on first login (related to sentence 1), it lacks details on adding or updating properties, saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, and the automatic enabling of new user accounts (related to sentences 2, 4, and 5).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the relevant property '# oidc.enableUser=true', matching the expected answer's instruction to uncomment and set it to true. However, it lacks explicit instructions to save the file and restart the XWiki instance."
