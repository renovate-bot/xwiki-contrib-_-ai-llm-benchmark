  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because while the output addresses the question about disabling notifications, it includes several irrelevant links to documentation pages and extensions that do not directly relate to the user's query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring complete alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are about topics like 'attaching files', 'moving and deleting attachments', 'macros and features for displaying content', 'administrating wiki features', 'permissions and security modules', and 'extensions and applications for XWiki', which are unrelated to notification settings or disabling notifications. None of the nodes address the input query about disabling notifications, leading to a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about automatic page following or notification settings as mentioned in the expected output."
