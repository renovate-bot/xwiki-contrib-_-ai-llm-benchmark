  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about disabling notifications. However, the score is not lower because there is still some relevant information present.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'XWiki syntax and verbatim content,' which is unrelated to notifications. The second node is about 'JWT authentication for the LLM Application,' which does not address notifications. The third node lists 'resources and API endpoints for the LLM Application,' which are not relevant to disabling notifications. The fourth node provides 'information for developers about building applications on XWiki,' which does not help with notifications. Lastly, the fifth node discusses 'database migration and invalid extensions,' which is not related to notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic page following, notification settings, or custom filters as described in the expected output."
