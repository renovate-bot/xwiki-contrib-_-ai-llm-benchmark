  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information on configuring access rights in XWiki. However, it includes links about Nested Pages Migration and XWiki Syntax, which are not directly relevant to the question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in retrieval context (rank 5) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node explains how pages and spaces are created and managed in XWiki, but it does not provide information on configuring access rights for teams. Similarly, the second node discusses the parent/child relationship and the concept of nested pages in XWiki, which is not relevant to configuring access rights for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights and creating spaces but lacks specific steps and details found in the expected output."
