  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the output mostly addresses the configuration question in XWiki, but it includes multiple source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem, slightly reducing the relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.29 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'content organization and rights inheritance in XWiki,' which does not provide specific steps for configuring permissions for teams, making it less relevant. The second node explains 'the parent/child relationship and the introduction of Nested Pages in XWiki,' which also does not address team access rights. The third node is about 'string formatting and OpenID Connect properties,' unrelated to the query. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than the fourth node, which provides relevant information about 'XWiki's permission system, including setting view and edit rights.' Additionally, the sixth node, which outlines 'basic rules for setting rights in XWiki,' is also relevant but ranked lower. This misranking of nodes contributes to the lower score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while most steps in the expected output align well with the nodes in retrieval context, such as setting rights and inheriting them for child pages, specific actions like creating groups for each team and adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces are not directly supported by the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions rights inheritance and setting rights at different levels, but lacks specific details about creating groups for each team and setting rights specifically for 'XWikiAllGroup' or individual team spaces as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "All factual statements in the actual output align with the expected output, including creating groups, assigning wiki-wide view rights, and setting space-specific edit rights with inheritance for child pages. No discrepancies or deviations are present."
