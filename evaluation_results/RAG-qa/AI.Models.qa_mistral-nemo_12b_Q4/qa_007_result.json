  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the answer is highly relevant and provides useful information about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes a link to the XWiki RESTful API documentation, which is not directly related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly states that group mappings can be edited in the `xwiki-authentication.properties` file, while the retrieval context specifies that group mappings are defined using the `oidc.groups.mapping` property.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node providing specific information about group synchronization (rank 4) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses general capabilities and installation details of the OpenID Connect Authenticator, and the second node provides links to various configuration guides, neither of which address group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.47 because while the retrieval context provides information on configuring group synchronization properties such as `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks details on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, as well as saving and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context briefly mentions group synchronization in the xwiki.properties file but lacks detailed steps and specific properties like oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, and oidc.groups.mapping."
