  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output mentions the creation or update of specific XWiki groups ('xwiki-admins' and 'xwiki-users'), which are not specified in the retrieval context. This minor inconsistency slightly affects the faithfulness score.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first three nodes provide detailed information on configuring the `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties, which are crucial for synchronizing groups between XWiki and the OpenID Connect provider. The irrelevant nodes, ranked fourth and fifth, only provide general information about OpenID Connect authentication and configuration guides or discuss authentication management and endpoint configuration, which do not specifically address group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide specific details about configuring properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', several general and introductory instructions from the expected output are not explicitly covered in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains detailed information on configuring the `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties, matching the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file and restarting the XWiki instance."
