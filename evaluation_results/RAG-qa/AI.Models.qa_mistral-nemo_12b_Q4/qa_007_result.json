  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The first three nodes provide detailed information on configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, which are crucial for group synchronization as required by the input. The irrelevant nodes, ranked fourth and fifth, discuss general OpenID Connect information and authentication management, which do not directly pertain to the group synchronization process.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.46 because while some specific configuration details like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, many introductory and procedural instructions such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, as well as saving changes and restarting XWiki, are missing from the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about configuring group synchronization using the `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties, which matches the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly addresses group synchronization setup, claim configuration, and group mapping, similar to the expected output. However, it introduces 'oidc.userinfoclaims' not present in the expected output and lacks the step to save and restart XWiki."
