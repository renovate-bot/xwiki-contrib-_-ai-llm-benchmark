    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response mostly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly pertain to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'model validation strategies in XWiki', the second node covers 'attachment validation and configuration in XWiki', and the third node provides details about 'the admin UI for model validation and its installation'. None of these are related to 'authenticating users with access tokens'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete mismatch.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to token-based authentication or JWTs as described in the expected output."
