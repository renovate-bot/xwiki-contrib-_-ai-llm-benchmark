  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the answer partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not directly relate to the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'JWT token generation and its claims,' which is unrelated to notifications about user activity. Similarly, the second node is about 'upgrading wikis and handling invalid extensions,' which does not pertain to enabling notifications for user actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention notifications about user activity, related settings, 'Erweiterte Filteroptionen', or user profile notification settings.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to notification settings or user activity filters."
