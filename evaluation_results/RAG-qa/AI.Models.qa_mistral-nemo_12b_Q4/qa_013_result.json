  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the response partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own activities, but includes irrelevant source links and information about XWiki features that do not directly answer the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'customization of page templates, internationalization, and other features unrelated to notification settings,' the second node is about 'administrating wiki features and does not mention notification settings or user activity,' and the third node focuses on 'importing documents, sharing pages, and other features not related to notifications for user activity.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete mismatch between the expected information and the provided context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to notification settings or user activity, which are key elements in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not address the expected output about disabling a notification filter in user settings and instead provides general instructions for a different system."
