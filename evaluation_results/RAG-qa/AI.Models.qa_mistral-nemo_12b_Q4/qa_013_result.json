  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the answer partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own activities, but includes irrelevant statements like source links that do not directly answer the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'themes, internationalization, accessibility, and performance,' which are unrelated to notification settings. The second node is about 'administrating wiki features' and does not mention notification settings or user activity. The third node covers 'importing office documents, icon themes, sharing pages, syntax highlighting, and mentions,' none of which relate to user notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user activity filters as mentioned in the expected output."
