  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about configuring user account activation with OpenID Connect. However, it includes a statement about the XWiki RESTful API, which is not directly related to the question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator' and does not address the specific configuration needed. Similarly, the second node discusses 'container authentication' without providing the necessary configuration details. The third node mentions 'automatic synchronization' but lacks specific configuration information. The fourth node explains 'different authentication methods' unrelated to the required configuration. Lastly, the fifth node lists 'various endpoints and customization options' but does not mention the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
