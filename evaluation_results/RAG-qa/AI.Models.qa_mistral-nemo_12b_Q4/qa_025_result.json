  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.45 because the response includes several irrelevant source links and introductory phrases that do not directly address the question about configuring automatic user activation. However, it likely contains some relevant information, which is why the score is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and bypassing OpenID Connect,' which does not address enabling user accounts automatically upon first login. The second node mentions 'container authentication and OpenID Connect,' but lacks details on automatic user activation. The third node describes 'OpenID Connect authentication and links to configuration guides,' but does not address automatic user activation. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension,' without information on user account activation. The fifth node focuses on 'LDAP and Active Directory integration,' which is unrelated to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context mentions 'xwiki.properties' and OpenID Connect, it lacks details on adding or updating properties, saving the file, restarting XWiki, and automatically activating new user accounts on first login.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention adjusting the xwiki.properties file or the specific property oidc.enableUser for automatic user activation via OpenID Connect.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output states that automatic activation of user accounts on first login is not supported by OpenID Connect in XWiki, contradicting the expected output, which provides instructions for enabling this feature."
