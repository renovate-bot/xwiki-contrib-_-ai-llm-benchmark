  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the answer addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to the explanation, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'LDAP authentication settings in XWiki', which is unrelated to token-based authentication, yet it is ranked higher than the second node, which is relevant as it provides information on configuring 'Authorized Applications'. Similarly, the third node, discussing 'OpenID Connect scopes and response types', is not directly related to token-based authentication, but is ranked higher than the fourth node, which directly addresses authentication using JWTs. However, the relevant nodes are still present, contributing to the score being 0.50.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key aspects such as the use of JWTs, enabling the token authenticator, and configuring authorized applications are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, some details like generating a JWT token with specific claims and including the token in the 'Authorization' header are not covered.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains information about configuring authorized applications, JWT token requirements, and enabling the token authenticator, aligning well with the expected answer. However, specific details about claims like expiration time and the use of Ed25519 key are not explicitly mentioned."
