  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to answering the question directly.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context, which 'explains how to configure authorized applications', is relevant and ranked higher than some irrelevant nodes. However, the first node discusses 'LDAP configuration, which is unrelated to token-based authentication using JWTs', and should be ranked lower. Additionally, the third node 'describes various claims and scopes for access tokens, but does not directly address the process of authenticating users with JWTs', which should also be ranked lower than the relevant fourth node that 'provides a description of the extension that allows authentication using JWTs'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide information about authenticating users with JWTs, enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and limitations on user creation, they lack details on generating a JWT token with specific signing key requirements and including the token in the 'Authorization' header.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes details about configuring authorized applications and JWT usage, matching the expected answer's description of token-based authentication. However, it lacks specific details about JWT claims and the requirement for an Ed25519 key.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly mentions using JWT for authentication, setting `xwiki.authentication.authclass`, and creating/updating users based on JWT. However, it introduces OpenID Connect, which is not part of the expected output, and lacks details about JWT claims, authorized applications, and token usage in headers."
