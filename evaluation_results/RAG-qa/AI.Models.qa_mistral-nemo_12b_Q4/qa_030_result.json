  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the answer partially addresses the question about configuring spaces in XWiki, but the presence of multiple irrelevant source link statements prevents it from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node is about 'the structure and metadata of a page in XWiki,' which does not address the question of configuring access rights. The second node discusses 'modifying resources using XML and HTTP methods,' which is not relevant to setting access permissions in XWiki. The third node covers 'managing comments and attachments,' unrelated to configuring team-specific access. The fourth node explains 'the concept of spaces and pages in XWiki,' but does not provide information on setting access rights for teams. The fifth node discusses 'migration actions and code adjustments,' which do not relate to configuring access rights for teams. Finally, the sixth node is about 'configuration display settings in XWiki administration,' which does not help in setting team-specific access rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context. The retrieval context lacks information on creating groups, setting rights at the wiki or space level, inheriting rights, and adjusting rights for teams or spaces.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to creating groups, setting rights at wiki or space level, or inheriting rights, which are all key components of the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output covers the visibility and modification restrictions for teams, but lacks details on creating groups and inheriting rights for child pages as specified in the expected output."
