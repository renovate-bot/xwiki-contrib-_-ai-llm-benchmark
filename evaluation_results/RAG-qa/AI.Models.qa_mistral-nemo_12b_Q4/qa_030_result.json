  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the main question about configuring spaces and permissions in XWiki. However, it includes a URL that does not directly address the specific question, which slightly reduces the relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.29 because the actual output repeatedly references 'spaces' and their management, while the retrieval context indicates that the notion of space has been removed from the UI and spaces are emulated temporarily.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node 'explains the creation of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki but does not address access control or permissions,' and the second node 'lists various macros and their purposes, which is unrelated to setting up access control for spaces in XWiki.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions creating spaces and managing pages but lacks specific steps for setting access rights and permissions as detailed in the expected output."
