  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the answer mostly addresses the configuration question about XWiki permissions, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to solving the issue, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'the structure of an XWiki page and its metadata', which does not address access control or permissions. The second node discusses 'modifying resources and creating pages using XML and HTTP methods', unrelated to configuring access permissions in XWiki. The third node focuses on 'adding, editing, and deleting comments', which is not related to setting access permissions for spaces in XWiki. The fourth node explains 'the creation of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki', but does not provide information on setting access permissions for teams. The fifth node is about 'migration actions related to page renaming and code adjustments', which are not relevant to configuring access permissions in XWiki. Lastly, the sixth node discusses 'configuring display scopes for administration pages', which does not address the question of setting access permissions for team spaces.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, setting permissions, or inheriting rights as described in the expected output."
