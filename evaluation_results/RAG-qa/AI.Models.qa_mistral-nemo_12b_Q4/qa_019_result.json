  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the main content effectively addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but the inclusion of source links that do not directly relate to the question slightly detracts from the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'form validation and JavaScript patterns', which are unrelated to denying script rights to a domain administrator. The second node is about 'template providers and page creation in XWiki', which does not relate to script rights or administrative permissions. The third node involves a 'code snippet for a custom right check class', but it does not address the specific issue of denying script rights to a domain administrator in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence about admin rights in XWiki is not supported by any information in the nodes in retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to admin rights or their denial, which is central to the expected output."
