  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response mostly addresses the input question about denying script rights to a domain administrator, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'JavaScript validation and field matching', which is unrelated to the topic of denying script rights in XWiki. The second node is about 'template providers and page creation in XWiki', which does not relate to script rights or their denial. The third node describes 'a custom right check configuration', but it does not address the specific issue of denying script rights to a space administrator in XWiki. Therefore, the irrelevant nodes are not ranked lower than any relevant nodes, resulting in a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence about a feature not supported by XWiki, specifically regarding admin rights, is not mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention anything about admin rights or their implications in XWiki, which is the focus of the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides steps to modify permissions in XWiki, while the expected output states that denying rights implied by admin rights is not supported, showing a discrepancy in key facts."
