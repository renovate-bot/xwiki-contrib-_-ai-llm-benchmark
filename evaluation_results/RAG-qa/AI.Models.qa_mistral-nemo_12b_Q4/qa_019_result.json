    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. However, the score is not lower because the core information provided is somewhat relevant to the input.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node contains a list of image links and references which are not relevant to the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator in XWiki, while the second node discusses authentication methods, specifically Kerberos and LDAP, which are also unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output discusses features and rights in XWiki that are not mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about admin rights or their denial in XWiki."
