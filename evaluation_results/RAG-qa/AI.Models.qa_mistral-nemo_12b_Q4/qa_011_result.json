  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the main issue about the notification bell not being available is addressed, but the inclusion of source links that do not directly address this issue prevents the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node, which discusses 'editing the xwiki.properties file' to enable notifications, is ranked last (6th). The irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'custom notification filters and their behavior', should be ranked lower as they do not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context supports the idea of editing the xwiki.properties file, it does not specifically mention setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is a key detail in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output suggests troubleshooting steps and provides links but does not mention setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` to `true`, which is a key detail in the expected output."
