  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of the bell not being available, but it includes repeated irrelevant statements about providing a source link, which do not directly address the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the sixth node, mentions editing the `xwiki.properties` file to enable notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`. However, this relevant information is ranked lower than the first five nodes, which are irrelevant as they discuss topics like 'custom notification filters', 'notification bell display', and 'administrators' ability to configure settings' without addressing how to enable notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context (node 5) supports the general idea of configuring notifications through settings and editing the xwiki.properties file, it lacks specific mention of the 'notifications.enabled' setting and its value 'true' as described in sentence 2 of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about enabling notifications via the xwiki.properties file, which is crucial in the expected answer."
