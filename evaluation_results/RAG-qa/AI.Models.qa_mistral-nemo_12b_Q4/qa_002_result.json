  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first and fourth nodes in the retrieval context are relevant to the input, discussing how to receive notifications and troubleshoot notification issues in XWiki. However, the second node, which is ranked higher than the fourth, discusses 'filtering notifications and hidden pages', and the third node focuses on 'RSS feeds and notification settings', neither of which directly address the issue of not receiving notifications. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some sentences in the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as the process of enabling notifications via the 'alert' menu (node 4) and following a user (node 1), other key instructions like enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and ensuring subscriptions are not directly supported by any nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on following users and watching pages, but lacks details on enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` and specific steps for watching pages or wikis."
