  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.52 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements about importing Java classes and method definitions, which do not directly address the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki. However, some relevant information may still be present, contributing to the score being above zero.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'general OpenID Connect configuration and endpoints' without mentioning user profile field mapping. The second node is about 'authentication methods and extensions, including LDAP and Active Directory,' which does not address OpenID Connect user profile field mapping. The third node provides 'links to configuration guides for specific systems' but lacks information on mapping user profile fields in `xwiki.properties`. The fourth node offers 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension' without discussing user profile field mapping. Lastly, the fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' unrelated to mapping user profile fields in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention customizing user profile fields or using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties`, which are key elements in the expected answer.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output incorrectly references 'xwiki.cfg' instead of 'xwiki.properties', omits the use of 'oidc.user.mapping', and introduces unnecessary scripting details not mentioned in the expected output. It also lacks the step to restart XWiki after saving changes."
