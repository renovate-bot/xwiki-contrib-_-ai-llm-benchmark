  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes statements that offer sources and documentation links without directly addressing the specific question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node in the retrieval context is highly relevant as it discusses the 'xwiki.properties' file and OpenID Connect, which directly pertains to configuring user profile fields. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only the first sentence of the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'xwiki.properties' and OpenID Connect provider configuration. The rest of the expected output lacks support as the retrieval context does not mention 'oidc.user.mapping', provide examples, or instructions on applying changes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks specific information about customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties` and the example mappings provided in the expected output."
