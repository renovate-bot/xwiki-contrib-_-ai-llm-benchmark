  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job maintaining accuracy!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context is ranked first, providing direct information on how to 'associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user', which is exactly what the input is asking about. The irrelevant nodes, which discuss topics such as 'access to various claims', 'configuration of OpenID Connect endpoints', 'group synchronization', and 'in-wiki configuration', are correctly ranked lower as they do not pertain to mapping user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context (node 3) supports the mapping example and customization process described in the expected output, it lacks explicit details on replacing 'myxproperty1' and 'myxproperty2' with actual XWiki user property names, and does not mention the need to save the 'xwiki.properties' file and restart XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the information from the expected output, including mapping user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file and the example mappings provided.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes the necessary mapping example and explanation for `oidc.user.mapping`, aligning with the expected output. However, it introduces additional facts like `oidc.user.nameFormater`, group synchronization, and event listeners, which are not in the expected output."
