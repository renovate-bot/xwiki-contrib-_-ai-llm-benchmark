  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response effectively addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using OpenID Connect, but includes a source link that does not directly contribute to the solution, slightly affecting the relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and provides an example of using 'oidc.user.mapping', is ranked first. This directly relates to customizing user profile fields, while the irrelevant nodes, such as the second node discussing scopes and response types, the third node focusing on endpoints and HTTP headers, and others, do not address user profile field mapping or customization and are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because most of the expected output is supported by the 1st node in retrieval context, such as the customization of user profile fields and example mappings. However, the retrieval context does not mention saving the xwiki.properties file or restarting XWiki, which affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the information from the expected answer, including details on customizing user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, with examples provided."
