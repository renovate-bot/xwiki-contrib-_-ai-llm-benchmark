  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of the bell icon not being available, but it includes a link to XWiki syntax documentation, which is not directly related to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior', which is unrelated to the input about enabling notifications in the wiki settings. Similarly, the second node lists 'various notification settings and customization options' without addressing the enabling of notifications. The third node provides 'links to various notification preferences' but does not mention enabling them. The fourth node describes 'the notification menu and its features', which is not related to the input. Lastly, the fifth node discusses 'getting an RSS feed for notifications and notification settings', again not mentioning enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, which lacks specific information about enabling notifications or modifying `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` to `true`, which is the core information in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not address enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file, and introduces unrelated information about a bell icon and potential translation errors, which are not present in the expected output."
