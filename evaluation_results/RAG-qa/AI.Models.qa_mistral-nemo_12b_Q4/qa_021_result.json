  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant to the issue of notification availability, but it includes an unnecessary link to XWiki syntax documentation, which slightly detracts from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior', which is unrelated to 'enabling notifications in the wiki settings'. The second node is about 'choosing notification email preferences and other customization options', which also does not address the issue of enabling notifications. The third node lists 'various notification preferences and macros', none of which relate to enabling notifications. The fourth node describes 'the notifications application and its features', without mentioning enabling notifications. Finally, the fifth node talks about 'getting an RSS feed for notifications and settings', again not mentioning enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context (node 5) supports the general idea of enabling notifications in the wiki, it lacks specific details about setting the `notifications.enabled` property in `xwiki.properties` to `true`, which is crucial for full alignment with the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`."
