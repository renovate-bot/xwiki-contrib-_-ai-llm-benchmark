  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.55 because while the answer includes some relevant information about managing notifications, it contains multiple irrelevant URLs and statements about friend lists, which do not directly address the question about disabling notifications for pages.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Auto Watch' and 'Default Watch Settings,' is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes discussing 'getting a notification RSS feed' (rank 1), 'various notification-related macros and preferences' (rank 2), 'ways to receive notifications' (rank 4), and 'overriding default notification templates' (rank 5) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while the retrieval context nodes mention default notification settings and the ability to modify them, they do not explicitly state that users will be notified of changes on their work.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions auto-watched pages and notification settings but lacks details on modifying the 'Suivi automatique des pages' and removing custom filters."
