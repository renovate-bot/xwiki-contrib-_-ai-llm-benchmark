  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response effectively addresses the question about disabling notifications, but it includes irrelevant links that do not directly help with managing or disabling notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The first three nodes effectively address the issue of automatic notifications by discussing 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode', 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', and 'Auto Watch' under 'Watched Entities'. The irrelevant node, ranked fourth, discusses 'Get a notification RSS feed' and 'Notifications Macro', which do not directly relate to managing automatic notifications, ensuring a perfect score. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, demonstrating a perfect alignment.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, aligning with the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit mention of modifying the 'Suivi automatique des pages' setting in user profile notification settings."
