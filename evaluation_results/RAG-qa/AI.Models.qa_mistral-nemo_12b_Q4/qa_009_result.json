  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes repeated irrelevant statements about a source link that does not directly address how to deny script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'programming rights and script execution' but does not address denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node lists 'various rights and their properties' without mentioning the inability to deny rights implied by admin rights. The third node explains 'script right and its default settings' but lacks information on denying script rights to a space administrator. The fourth node contains 'code snippets related to access checks' but does not provide relevant information. The fifth node is about 'converting rights during page migration' and does not relate to the input question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The expected answer states that rights implied by admin right cannot be denied, which is supported by the retrieval context indicating that ADMIN right is not deniable and implies other rights."
