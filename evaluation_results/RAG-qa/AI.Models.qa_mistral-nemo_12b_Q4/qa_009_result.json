  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the answer partially addresses the question about denying script rights, but includes irrelevant source links and markdown format statements that do not directly contribute to the solution.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses programming rights and script execution but does not address the denial of script rights to a space administrator. The second node lists rights and their default states but does not mention the inability to deny rights implied by admin rights. The third node explains the 'Script' right but does not mention the inability to deny rights implied by admin rights. The fourth node provides technical details about checking access rights but does not address the specific issue of denying script rights to a space administrator. The fifth node discusses converting rights during page migration, which is unrelated to denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, matching the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output incorrectly suggests that the 'Script' right can be denied to a space administrator, contradicting the expected output that states implied rights by admin cannot be denied."
