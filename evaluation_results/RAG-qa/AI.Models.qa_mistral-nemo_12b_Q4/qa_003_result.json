  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own activity in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node explains, 'By default, one don't receive notification about one's own activity... You have the ability to disable this filter in the \"Advanced filtering options\" section of your own notification settings,' which directly answers the input question. The second node also supports this by stating, 'By default, you won\u2019t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' which is relevant to enabling notifications for one's own actions. The irrelevant nodes, such as the third node discussing 'administrator settings and notification preferences inheritance,' do not directly address the input question and are ranked lower. Great job maintaining perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context fully contains the expected answer, detailing the default notification settings and the ability to change them in the 'Advanced filtering options' section.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output accurately reflects the expected output with minor discrepancies; it adds steps for disabling the filter, aligning with the expected logical flow and facts."
