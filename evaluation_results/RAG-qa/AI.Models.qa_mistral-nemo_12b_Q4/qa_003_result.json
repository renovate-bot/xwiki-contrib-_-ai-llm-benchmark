  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that notifications for your own activities are typically enabled by default, while the retrieval context clarifies that users do not receive such notifications by default.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. The first two nodes directly address the issue by mentioning that 'By default, one don\u2019t receive notification about one\u2019s own activity' and 'This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' which are pertinent to enabling notifications for one's own actions. The irrelevant nodes, such as the third node discussing 'administrator settings and global notification configurations,' are ranked lower, ensuring high precision. Great job on achieving perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all information from the expected answer, including the default setting of not receiving notifications about one's own activity unless explicitly targeted, and the ability to disable this filter in the advanced filtering options of the user's notification settings."
