  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the question about setting upload restrictions for images or PDFs in a wiki, but includes irrelevant links about exporting features, XWiki syntax, and document lifecycle, which are not directly related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first three nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, discussing 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', 'ODT and PDF export features', and 'various macros and features', none of which relate to configuring attachment restrictions in a wiki. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than the relevant nodes, which appear later and discuss 'Size Limit' and 'Mimetype Restriction', as well as detailed steps on setting maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions. Additionally, the last node is also irrelevant as it focuses on 'document lifecycle features'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.70 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context provides detailed steps related to configuring the maximum attachment size (sentences 6 to 11 in the expected output), there is no information about configuring MIME types (sentences 2 to 5 in the expected output) in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting limits on attachment size and MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details about configuring MIME types in xwiki.properties and setting the maximum size to 10 MB as described in the expected answer."
