  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because the response partially addresses the question about limiting file types and sizes for attachments, but the repeated irrelevant source links reduce its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', which is unrelated to file upload restrictions. The second node talks about 'various XWiki applications and features, such as administration and PDF export', but does not mention file upload restrictions. The third node is about 'CSS and XSL customization for PDF exports', which does not relate to setting file upload restrictions. The fourth node covers 'various XWiki macros and features like PDF viewer and office document viewer', but does not address file upload restrictions. The fifth node consists of 'image links and references', which are not relevant to configuring file upload restrictions. Finally, the sixth node contains 'image links and references', which do not provide information on setting file upload restrictions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the expected output sentences can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context lacks information on configuring MIME types, setting maximum upload size, or any related steps.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to configuring MIME types or setting maximum attachment size as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output suggests using extensions 'File Size Limit' and 'Allowed Attachments' instead of editing `xwiki.properties` and XWikiPreferences as in the expected output. It does not mention the MIME type configuration or the exact process for setting upload size in the preferences."
