  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node (rank 5) that mentions the `xwiki.properties` file is ranked lower than four irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific configuration needed, and the second node includes links to various guides without mentioning the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' in the 2nd node in the retrieval context is relevant to the expected output, while other specific instructions and properties are not covered.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
