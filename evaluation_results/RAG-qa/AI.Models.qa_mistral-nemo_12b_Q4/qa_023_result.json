  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response is mostly relevant to the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it includes source links that are not directly related to the topic, slightly reducing its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is ranked first and directly addresses the input question about receiving notifications for one's own activity. Great job on ranking the relevant information at the top!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the ability to change this setting, aligning closely with the expected output. However, the specific location 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' is not explicitly mentioned."
