  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'group synchronization, including the use of claims and mappings in the xwiki.properties file', is ranked third. This means it is ranked lower than two irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'authentication management and endpoint configurations', and the second node focuses on 'different authentication methods and extensions, such as LDAP and Active Directory', both of which are not directly related to group synchronization setup. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports configuring group synchronization, claims, separators, and mappings as mentioned in sentences 3, 5, and 7 of the expected output, it lacks details on locating, opening, and saving the 'xwiki.properties' file, as well as replacing placeholders with actual values as described in sentences 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks details on configuring oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator, which are specified in the expected output."
