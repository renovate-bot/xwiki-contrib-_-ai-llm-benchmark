  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the answer is mostly relevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, but it includes a statement about creating new users in XWiki, which is not directly relevant to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.89 because the actual output incorrectly claims that XWiki can synchronize groups at regular intervals, while the retrieval context only mentions synchronization during authentication.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which addresses group synchronization by mentioning the xwiki.properties file and the oidc.groups.claim property, is correctly ranked higher. However, irrelevant nodes like the first node, which provides general information about prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies, and the third node, which provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, are ranked too high.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.46 because while the 2nd node in the retrieval context provides relevant information about configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks details on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, replacing placeholder values, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains information about configuring group synchronization in the xwiki.properties file, including properties like oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.mapping. However, it lacks specific details on setting oidc.groups.separator and saving/restarting the instance."
