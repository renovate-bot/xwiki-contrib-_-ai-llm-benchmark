  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because the output partially addresses the question about configuring team access and permissions in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the specific task of setting permissions for teams to view all areas while only editing their own.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database efficiency and programming features', which do not relate to configuring access control for teams. The second node describes the 'Notifications Application in XWiki', which is unrelated to setting access permissions for team areas. The third node explains 'Nested Pages and subwikis', but lacks information on configuring access rights for teams. The fourth node mentions 'managing users and groups', but does not provide specific instructions on setting access rights for team areas. Finally, the fifth node discusses 'group synchronization and customization in XWiki', which is not directly related to configuring access control for team areas.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.12 because only sentence 1 from the expected output is supported by node 4 in the retrieval context, which mentions managing users and groups. All other sentences lack support from the retrieval context nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to access control steps or managing team-specific rights in XWiki, as outlined in the expected output."
