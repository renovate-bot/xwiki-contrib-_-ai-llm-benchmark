  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the output largely addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant links to unrelated documentation, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the fourth node in the retrieval context, which is relevant as it 'provides a link to managing users and groups,' is ranked lower than three irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'XWiki's use of databases and programming features,' the second node describes 'the Notifications Application,' and the third node explains 'Nested Pages and subwikis,' none of which are pertinent to configuring access controls for teams. This misranking of relevant and irrelevant nodes results in a lower score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context. The retrieval context lacks information on steps for access control, creating groups, setting rights, and ensuring visibility and edit permissions as described in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to access control steps or team-specific rights management as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output suggests using nested pages and specific permissions but lacks detailed steps on setting wiki-wide and area-level rights, and inheritance of rights for subpages, as described in the expected output."
