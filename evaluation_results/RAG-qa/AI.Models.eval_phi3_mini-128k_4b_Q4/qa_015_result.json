  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.11 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant to the question about configuring XWiki for OpenID Connect, with only a very small portion potentially addressing the topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in retrieval context ranked from 1 to 3 are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'domain-based instances and session cookies', which is not relevant to automatically activating user accounts on first login with OpenID Connect. The second node provides general information about OpenID Connect, including 'prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies', but does not address the specific configuration needed. The third node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', which is also unrelated to the required configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the mention of the xwiki.properties file in the 3rd node in the retrieval context aligns with the expected output, while there are no specific instructions or mentions of the property `oidc.enableUser` or the process to uncomment and set properties.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically activate user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information that is present in the context, such as details about domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, and configuration guides for OpenID Connect."
