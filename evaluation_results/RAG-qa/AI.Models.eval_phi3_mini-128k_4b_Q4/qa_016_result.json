  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.99 because the answer is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using OpenID Connect, with only a minor irrelevant statement about scalability and performance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly states that `xwiki.cfg` should be configured to accept the custom ClaimExtractor, while the retrieval context clarifies that the OIDC authenticator does not rely on the property xwiki.authentication.cookiedomains in xwiki.cfg.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration', which is not relevant. The second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator' but does not address the specific query. The third node talks about 'XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities', which are unrelated to the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to customize user profile fields or map additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several crucial details such as configuring the session cookie for domain-based instances, prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, configuration guides for specific systems, and technical specifics about XWiki, indicating a high level of hallucination."
