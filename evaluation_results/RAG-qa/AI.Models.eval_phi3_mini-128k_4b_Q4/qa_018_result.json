  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the input question about restricting uploads to images or PDF files with a maximum size of 10 MB.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'HTTP methods and media types for retrieving page history and children,' the second node is about 'creating or updating a page translation and its history,' and the third node focuses on 'creating a new wiki and retrieving spaces.' None of these nodes address configuring MIME types or attachment sizes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about uploading images or PDF files, configuring MIME types, or setting the maximum attachment size.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides information about API endpoints, HTTP methods, and status codes, which are irrelevant to the input question about restricting uploads to images or PDF files with a maximum size of 10 MB.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output is a URL and does not provide any information about the HTTP methods, media types, descriptions, or status codes for the specified endpoints, which is in complete disagreement with the context that describes various API endpoints and their details."
