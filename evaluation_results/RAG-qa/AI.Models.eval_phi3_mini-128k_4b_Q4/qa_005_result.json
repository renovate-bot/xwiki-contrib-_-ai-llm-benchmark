  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the configuration issue mentioned in the input.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in the retrieval context ranked 1, 2, and 3 discuss 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator', and 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' respectively, which are not relevant to the specific configuration needed to enable user accounts on first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.17 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context mentions 'xwiki.properties' and 'oidc.skipped', it does not provide details on adding or updating specific properties, setting 'oidc.enableUser' to 'true', saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, or ensuring new user accounts are automatically enabled upon first login via OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based instances, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, which are irrelevant to configuring XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with any of the provided contexts, failing to mention key details about authentication, prerequisites, installation instructions, configuration guides, and dependencies for OpenID Connect in XWiki."
