    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant statements and URLs that do not address the specific configuration issue mentioned in the input.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node provides general information on how to get started with XWiki, but it does not address specific access control configurations. The second node explains the differences between first and second generation wikis and mentions features like page editing and version control, but it does not provide detailed steps for setting access rights as required by the input. The third node discusses the general concept of wikis and their advantages but does not provide specific instructions on configuring access rights in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about XWiki and wikis but does not address the specific question about configuring team permissions in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not provide any information that aligns with the context and appears to be a list of URLs and unrelated text, indicating a complete lack of relevant factual content."
