  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the input question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node that directly addresses the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator is ranked third. The first node discusses 'configuration and customization of access decisions' which is not relevant, and the second node explains 'how to register and unregister custom rights,' also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly aligns with the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses the AuthorizationSettler and its configurations, which does not address how to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to address the specific content of the context, such as the AuthorizationSettler, right definitions, and the process of registering and unregistering rights. Instead, it provides irrelevant URLs to documentation, leading to a high hallucination score."
