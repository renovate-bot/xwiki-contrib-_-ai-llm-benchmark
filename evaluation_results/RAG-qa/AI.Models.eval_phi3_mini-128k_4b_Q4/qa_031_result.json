  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.06 because the majority of the statements are incoherent, incomplete, or unrelated to the topic of user authentication with access tokens.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node provides detailed information about JWT token generation, which is directly relevant to authenticating users with access tokens. The subsequent nodes discuss topics like document management, cookie protection, and security strategies for failed login attempts, which are not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because the retrieval context nodes mention key aspects like JWT tokens, required claims, and configuration steps, but they do not cover generating a JWT token specifically or creating/updating users based on token information.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses document management and various authentication strategies in XWiki, but does not address user authentication with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to provide any relevant information or details as described in the context, leading to a complete misalignment with the expected content."
