  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring XWiki to automatically activate user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in retrieval context ranked 1, 2, and 3 are irrelevant. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address automatic user activation. The second node discusses domain-based instance configuration and session cookie settings, which are unrelated to the required configuration. The third node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension, which does not help with automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the second sentence in the expected output can be directly linked to the 2nd node in the retrieval context, while the rest of the sentences lack explicit support from the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the issue of automatically activating user accounts upon first login and includes irrelevant details such as release notes and domain-based authentication.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and all contradictions indicate that the actual output is consistent with the context provided."
