    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.17 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant to the issue of the notification bell not being available, as indicated by the provided list of irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in retrieval context ranked 1, 2, and 3 discuss email notifications, RSS feeds, and notification-related macros, but none of them address enabling notifications in the wiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly matches the expected output, providing clear and accurate information.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses features and configurations of the Notifications Application in XWiki, but it does not address the specific issue of the bell icon not being available even with the 'Alert Notification' extension installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks alignment with the context and fails to provide relevant details or links about changes, macros, or enabling/disabling the extension, as well as information about notification RSS feeds, Notifications Macro, or settings."
