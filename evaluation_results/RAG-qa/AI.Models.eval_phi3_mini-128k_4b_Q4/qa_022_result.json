  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the output contains irrelevant information such as a URL related to XWiki syntax and a nonsensical statement, which do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) is ranked lower than two irrelevant nodes (first and second nodes). The first node lists various notification-related macros and their purposes but does not provide instructions on enabling notifications or following pages/users. The second node discusses the details of changes in email notifications and the level of detail a user can select, but it does not address enabling notifications or following pages/users.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only the first sentence in the expected output is supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, while the rest of the sentences are not mentioned.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses settings and configurations related to notifications, but it does not address the specific issue of not receiving notifications, as highlighted by 'it does not address the issue of not receiving notifications.'",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to provide any relevant information related to the notifications macros, changes displayed in email content, and types of notifications, which are all mentioned in the context. There are no contradictions, but the lack of alignment with the context results in a high hallucination score."
