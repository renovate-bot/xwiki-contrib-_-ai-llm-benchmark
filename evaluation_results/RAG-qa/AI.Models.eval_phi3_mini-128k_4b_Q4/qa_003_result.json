    "AnswerRelevancy": "Failed to measure after 3 attempts: Evaluation LLM outputted an invalid JSON. Please use a better evaluation model.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides links to various notification-related preferences but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The second node describes different ways to receive notifications in XWiki but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The third node discusses email notifications and their settings but does not provide information on how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports all the sentences in the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions, focusing instead on general notification settings and unrelated features.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output completely lacks the necessary information about notification macros, ways to be notified, and email notifications configurations as listed in the context, leading to a high level of hallucination."
