  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.08 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are completely irrelevant to the input question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.83 because the first node provides essential information about the `oidc.groups.claim` property, which is crucial for configuring group synchronization. The second node, discussing domain-based authentication and cookie configuration, is not relevant and should be ranked lower. The third node, detailing the default group synchronization and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property, is directly relevant and appropriately ranked.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks details on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, replacing placeholder values, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the context discusses domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, which are not relevant to group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not provide any information related to the context provided, missing details about user profiles, custom claims, group synchronization settings, authentication, session cookie configuration, bypassing OpenID Connect, customization, and troubleshooting in XWiki."
