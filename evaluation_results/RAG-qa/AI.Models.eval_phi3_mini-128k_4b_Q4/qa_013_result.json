  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and right definitions, the second node is about blocked attachment mimetypes, and the third node discusses the checkAccess() method and access control. None of these are related to notifications or user activity settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about notifications, user activity, 'Erweiterten Filteroptionen', user notification settings, or user profiles.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like 'AuthorizationSettler', 'blocked attachment mimetypes', and 'access control', which are unrelated to enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention key elements from the context and introduces unrelated content, leading to a complete misalignment with the provided context."
