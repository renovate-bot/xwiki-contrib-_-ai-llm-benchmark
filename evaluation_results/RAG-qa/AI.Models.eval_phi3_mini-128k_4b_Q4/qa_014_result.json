  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.17 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant to the question about disabling notifications, focusing instead on unrelated topics like URLs, attachment management, and other non-notification related issues.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly states that `xwiki.attachments_cleaner.enabled = false` should be checked to prevent automatic cleanup on page load, while the retrieval context specifies that `store.fsattach.cleanOnStartup` should be set to false in xwiki.properties to prevent XWiki from cleaning up empty directories on startup.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'blocked attachment mimetypes and their configuration', which is unrelated to disabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like blocked attachment mimetypes, default language settings, and directory cleanup, which are unrelated to the input about disabling notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information on several key topics such as blocked attachment mimetypes, setting the default language for a page, and directory cleanup or database attachment store configuration, leading to a high hallucination score."
