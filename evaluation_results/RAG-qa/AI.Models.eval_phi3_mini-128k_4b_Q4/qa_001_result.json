  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the output contains multiple irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the input question about the 'Bell' notification feature in XWiki. However, some parts of the output may still be somewhat related to the topic, hence the score is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses various applications and features in XWiki but does not address how to enable notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`. The second node mentions the 'What's New Application' for notifications about news but does not provide information on enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties`. The third node lists various notification preferences and macros but does not mention the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the need for enabling notifications is implied by the 2nd node in the retrieval context, there is no mention of 'xwiki.properties' or the specific setting 'notifications.enabled' in any of the nodes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context lists various applications and features in XWiki that are not directly related to the availability of the 'Bell' icon or the 'Alert Notification' extension.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with any of the provided contexts and does not provide relevant information, indicating a complete lack of factual alignment."
