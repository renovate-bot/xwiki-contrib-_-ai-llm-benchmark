  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.05 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant to the input question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with only a minimal portion potentially related.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides general information about OpenID Connect and its integration with XWiki, but does not address the specific steps required to set up group synchronization. The second node discusses domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration, which is unrelated to the process of setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The third node provides information about XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities, which are not relevant to the specific question about setting up group synchronization with an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the process for setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, focusing instead on unrelated topics like domain-based authentication and multi-tenancy.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks significant details provided in the context, such as prerequisites, installation instructions, configuration for domain-based instances, session cookie settings, and XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities. There are no contradictions, but the omissions lead to a high hallucination score."
