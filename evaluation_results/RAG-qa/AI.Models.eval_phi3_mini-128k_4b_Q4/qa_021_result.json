  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.30 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not address the issue about the notification bell not being available, significantly reducing its relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides general information about the menu and notifications but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The second node lists various notification preferences and macros but does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The third node discusses following users and default watch settings but does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence in the expected output is supported by the retrieval context, but the second sentence is not mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the issue of the bell icon not being available even when the 'Notification d'alerte' extension is installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with the provided context in multiple instances, providing unrelated URLs and text snippets instead of relevant information. There are no contradictions, but the misalignment is consistent and significant."
