  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.16 because the majority of the statements in the actual output are irrelevant to the input about configuring spaces in XWiki, making the response largely unhelpful.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the nodes in retrieval context are all irrelevant. The first node discusses 'the scope and display of configurations in XWiki', the second node explains 'the creation of spaces and pages in XWiki', and the third node is about 'XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering capabilities'. None of these directly address setting access controls for team spaces.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address configuring team permissions in XWiki, focusing instead on unrelated technical details and configurations.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details that are present in the context, including information about the scope and configuration display options for XWiki 13.7+, the creation and management of pages and spaces in XWiki, and XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering features."
