  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.06 because the majority of the statements in the output are irrelevant and nonsensical in the context of the input question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookies,' the second node talks about 'database efficiency and programming features,' and the third node describes 'form utilization on XWiki.org,' none of which pertain to customizing or mapping user profile fields from OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and database support, which are irrelevant to the input question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the factual alignments, such as domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, XWiki's use of a relational database, supported databases, and specific forms on XWiki.org."
