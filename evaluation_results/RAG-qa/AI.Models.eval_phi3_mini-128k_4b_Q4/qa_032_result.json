  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying true to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node providing detailed information on JWT token requirements is ranked first, while the irrelevant nodes discussing attachment mimetype restrictions and custom authentication using a Groovy script are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while some sentences in the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, several key sentences cannot be attributed to any parts of the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses blocked attachment mimetypes and custom authentication methods, which are irrelevant to the input question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output URLs do not align with the contexts provided. The correct URLs should be related to token generation and JWT claims, attachment validation and mimetype restrictions, and custom authentication using Groovy scripts, respectively."
