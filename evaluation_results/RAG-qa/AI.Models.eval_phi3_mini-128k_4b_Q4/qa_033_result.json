  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant and nonsensical statements that do not address the input question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the first node is irrelevant as it 'does not mention anything related to user authentication with access tokens' and should be ranked lower than the second node, which 'provides detailed information about the JWT token requirements and the process of generating and using these tokens for authentication'. Additionally, the third node is also irrelevant since it discusses 'various features and extensions of XWiki, such as the Menu application and Notifications, which are not relevant to user authentication with access tokens'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because only a few sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, while the majority of the sentences are not supported by the provided nodes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the context discusses form utilization on XWiki.org and various applications, which does not address the topic of authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to include several key details mentioned in the context, such as the Reference Form, Questionnaire Form, Token Generation, JWT token requirements, Menu application, Notifications, and Invitation features."
