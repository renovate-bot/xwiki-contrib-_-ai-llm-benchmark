  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains numerous irrelevant statements that do not address the question about configuring spaces in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the first node 'explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki' but 'does not provide any information on how to configure access control for viewing and editing spaces.' The second node is 'about executing a plan for a migration process in XWiki,' which is 'unrelated to configuring access control for teams.' The third node discusses 'the XAR export feature in XWiki,' which is 'not relevant to setting access control for teams to view and edit spaces.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provided discusses concepts like spaces, migration of nested pages, and XAR export, but does not address how to configure permissions for teams in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with the context in multiple instances, providing irrelevant URLs instead of the expected information about XWiki features such as the creation of pages and spaces, executing a plan, and XAR export."
