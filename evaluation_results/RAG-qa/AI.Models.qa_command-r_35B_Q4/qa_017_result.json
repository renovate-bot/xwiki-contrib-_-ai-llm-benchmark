    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining complete alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides general information about OpenID Connect authentication without specific steps for group synchronization. The second node describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension but lacks details on configuring group synchronization. The third node discusses other authentication methods like Active Directory and LDAP, not group synchronization with OpenID Connect. The fourth node mentions group synchronization but does not provide detailed steps or settings. The fifth node lists various configuration guides but does not include specific instructions for group synchronization with an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is directly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization but lacks specific details on configuring `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties in `xwiki.properties`."
