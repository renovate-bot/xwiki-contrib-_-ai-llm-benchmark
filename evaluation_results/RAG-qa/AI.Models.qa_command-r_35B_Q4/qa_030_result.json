  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the specific question about configuring team spaces in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims to select 'Espaces' in the 'Gestion des droits' menu, while the retrieval context states that the notion of space has been removed from the XWiki UI.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access controls for team spaces. For example, the first node explains how pages and spaces are created and managed in XWiki, which does not address the input query. Similarly, the second node lists various macros and their functionalities, which is unrelated to the query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the steps or details mentioned in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, defining rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages."
