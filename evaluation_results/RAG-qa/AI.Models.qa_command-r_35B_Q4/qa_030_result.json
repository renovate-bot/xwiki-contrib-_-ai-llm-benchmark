  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the output provides relevant information about configuring spaces in XWiki, but it includes multiple source links that do not directly address the input question, reducing the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides 'XML metadata about a page in XWiki but does not address access control or permissions setup', which is unrelated to configuring team space access. The second node describes 'how to modify resources using XML representations and HTTP methods', which is also unrelated. Subsequent nodes similarly fail to address the input query, discussing topics like 'editing comments and managing attachments', 'the concept of spaces and pages', 'migration issues', and 'configuration display settings', none of which pertain to setting access permissions for team spaces.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, setting rights, or inheriting rights in XWiki as described in the expected output."
