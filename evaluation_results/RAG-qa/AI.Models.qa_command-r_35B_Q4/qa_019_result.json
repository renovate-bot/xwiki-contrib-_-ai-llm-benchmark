  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'form validation and JavaScript patterns', which is unrelated to denying script rights in XWiki. The second node is about 'templates and page creation in XWiki', which does not address the issue of script rights. The third node talks about 'a custom right check class in XWiki', but it does not specifically address the inability to deny script rights to an admin. Therefore, none of the nodes provide relevant information, resulting in a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output discusses XWiki's admin rights, which is not mentioned in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about rights or admin rights in XWiki, which is the main focus of the expected answer."
