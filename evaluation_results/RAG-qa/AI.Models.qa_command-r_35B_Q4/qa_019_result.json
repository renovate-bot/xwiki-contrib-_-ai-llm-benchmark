  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response mostly addresses the question about revoking script rights from a space administrator, but includes a source link that does not directly answer the question, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'form validation and JavaScript patterns', the second node is about 'template providers and page creation in XWiki', and the third node involves 'a custom right check and configuration in XWiki', none of which relate to denying script rights to an area administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence about admin rights and their limitations in XWiki cannot be linked to any information in the nodes in retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to admin rights or their implications, which is the main focus of the expected answer.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not align with the expected output. It fails to mention the key factual detail that rights implied by admin rights cannot be denied. Instead, it provides general advice on permission changes and suggests consulting an expert, which deviates from the expected factual statement."
