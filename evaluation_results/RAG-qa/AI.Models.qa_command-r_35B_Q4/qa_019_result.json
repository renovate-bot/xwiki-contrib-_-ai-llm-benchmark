  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the answer provides some relevant information, but it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the specific question about denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'image links and references', which is not relevant to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence does not match any part of the nodes in retrieval context, which primarily discuss image references, LDAP authentication, and form utilization in XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to the admin rights or their denial in XWiki, which is the core of the expected answer."
