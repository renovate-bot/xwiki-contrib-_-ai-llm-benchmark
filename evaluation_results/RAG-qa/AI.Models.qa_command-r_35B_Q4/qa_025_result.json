  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes a mention of LDAP Authenticator, which is not pertinent to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', which does not relate to enabling user accounts automatically using OpenID Connect. The second node mentions OpenID Connect but lacks information on 'automatically activating user accounts on first login'. The third node provides a general description of OpenID Connect without addressing the specific configuration needed. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' without discussing user account activation. Lastly, the fifth node focuses on 'LDAP and Active Directory integration', which is unrelated to the required OpenID Connect configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the general idea of configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, it lacks specific instructions on updating the 'xwiki.properties' file and does not mention the need to save the file and restart XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any mention of adjusting the xwiki.properties file or the specific property oidc.enableUser, which are crucial details in the expected output."
