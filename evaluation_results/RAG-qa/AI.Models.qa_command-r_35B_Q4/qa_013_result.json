  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response addresses the main question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but the inclusion of source links and irrelevant statements about the origin of information slightly detracts from its direct relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'customization of page templates and internationalization', the second node is about 'administrating wiki features', and the third node addresses 'importing documents and syntax highlighting'. None of these nodes relate to notification settings for user activity, which is the focus of the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be linked to any nodes in the retrieval context, leading to a complete lack of supportive evidence.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user profile options, which are the main points in the expected output."
