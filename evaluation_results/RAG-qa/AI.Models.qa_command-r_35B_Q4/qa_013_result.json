  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.44 because the response contains multiple irrelevant statements, such as unrelated source links and suggestions, which do not directly address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, there might be some partial relevance or attempts to address the question, which prevents the score from being lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output incorrectly refers to 'What's New' as an extension, while the retrieval context specifies it as a UI feature called 'What's New UI'.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'customization of page templates, internationalization, and other features unrelated to notification settings.' The second node is about 'administrating wiki features and does not mention notification settings or user activity.' The third node covers 'various XWiki extensions like Office Importer, Font Awesome, and others, none of which relate to user notification settings.' These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than any relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about notification settings or user activity filters mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks key facts from the expected output, such as not mentioning the lack of default notifications for one's own activity and how to disable this filter in notification settings. It introduces irrelevant information about features and extensions not present in the expected output."
