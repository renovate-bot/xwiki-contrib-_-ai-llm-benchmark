    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes URLs that do not directly address the question about enabling notifications for own actions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and general notification settings' but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. Similarly, the second node lists 'various notification settings and customization options' but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention that users do not receive notifications about their own activity by default (sentence 1) and does not mention the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the notification settings (sentence 2).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and the ability to enable/disable notifications, but it lacks specific details about disabling the filter for one's own activity and the 'Advanced filtering options' section."
