  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response mostly addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, which explain that 'By default, one don\u2019t receive notification about one\u2019s own activity' and provide solutions to 'disable this filter in the \"Advanced filtering options\" section of your own notification settings' (first node), are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The irrelevant nodes, such as the one discussing 'administrators configuring notification settings for users' (third node), are correctly ranked lower. Great job on the precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the information from the expected answer, including the default behavior of not receiving notifications about one's own activity unless explicitly targeted, and the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the notification settings in the user profile.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly states the default behavior and how to disable it, matching the expected output. It provides additional detail on navigating to the setting, which doesn't contradict the expected output but enhances user understanding."
