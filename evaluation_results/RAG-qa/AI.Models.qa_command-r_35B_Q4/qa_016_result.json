  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using OpenID Connect, with no irrelevant statements present. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the OpenID Connect Provider extension is required, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints', which does not mention user profile field mapping. The second node is about 'container authentication and other methods like LDAP and Active Directory', unrelated to OpenID Connect user profile fields. The third node provides a 'general description of OpenID Connect authentication' without addressing user profile field mapping. The fourth node includes 'metadata about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', but does not discuss user profile field mapping. The fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', which is unrelated to the customization of user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the nodes in retrieval context support the general process of configuring OpenID Connect user mappings and saving changes in 'xwiki.properties', they lack specific examples and instructions on replacing placeholder values, which are present in sentences 2 and 3 of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties` as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output fails to provide any of the key facts present in the expected output regarding customization of user profile fields using `xwiki.properties` and `oidc.user.mapping`. It only suggests exploring other resources and does not mention the specific steps or code examples given in the expected output."
