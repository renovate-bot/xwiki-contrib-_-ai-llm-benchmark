    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, including prerequisites, dependencies, and installation instructions, but does not address the specific question about customizing user profile fields. The second node describes the general functionality of the OpenID Connect Authenticator and provides some metadata about the extension, but it does not provide information on how to customize user profile fields. The third node discusses container authentication and mentions the OpenID Connect Authenticator, but it does not provide details on customizing user profile fields. The fourth node lists various endpoints and customization options for the OpenID Connect Authenticator, but it does not specifically address how to map additional user profile fields. The fifth node provides a table of contents and links to various sections related to the OpenID Connect Authenticator, but it does not directly answer the question about customizing user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the relevant nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions 'xwiki.properties' but lacks details on 'oidc.user.mapping' and specific configuration steps."
