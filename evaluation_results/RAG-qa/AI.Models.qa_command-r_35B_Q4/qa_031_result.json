  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes multiple irrelevant statements providing source links that do not directly answer the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'LDAP authentication settings, which is unrelated to token-based authentication with JWTs' and should be ranked lower. The second node is relevant as it 'provides information on configuring authorized applications, which is relevant to setting up token-based authentication.' The third node, which 'describes OpenID Connect scopes and response types, which do not directly relate to JWT token-based authentication for the LLM Application,' should also be ranked lower. The fourth node is relevant as it 'describes the JWT token authenticator, which is directly relevant to the expected output about using access tokens for authentication.' Finally, the fifth node 'provides a general overview of XWiki authentication mechanisms, but does not specifically address JWT token-based authentication,' and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while the retrieval context nodes provide substantial information about JWT authentication, such as enabling the token authenticator and configuring authorized applications, they lack specific details on generating a JWT token with required claims and including it in the 'Authorization' header.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions the use of JWT for authentication and configuring authorized applications, aligning with the expected answer. However, it lacks details on specific claims required in the token and the use of Ed25519 key for signing.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions JWT and how to enable it, aligning partly with the expected output. However, it introduces OpenID Connect, which is additional incorrect information not present in the expected output. It also lacks details on configuring authorized applications, generating JWT tokens with specific claims, and the limitation regarding user creation."
