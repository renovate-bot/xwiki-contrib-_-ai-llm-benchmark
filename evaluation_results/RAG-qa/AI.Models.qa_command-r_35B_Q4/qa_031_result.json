  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node (rank 2) about configuring 'Authorized Applications' is ranked higher than some irrelevant nodes. However, the first node discusses claims at the UserInfo endpoint, which is irrelevant to authenticating users with access tokens and should be ranked lower. Similarly, nodes ranked 3, 4, and 5 provide general security information, cookie protection, and user profile visibility, which are all unrelated to the input query and should also be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.14 because the retrieval context only partially supports the expected output, specifically regarding the configuration of 'Authorized Applications' (sentence 2), while missing key details about token-based authentication, JWT specifics, and other necessary configurations.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions 'Authorized Applications' and JWT tokens but lacks details on enabling the token authenticator, specific claims, and usage instructions."
