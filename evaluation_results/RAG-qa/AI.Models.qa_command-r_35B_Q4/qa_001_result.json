    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) discussing the `notifications.enabled` setting in the `xwiki.properties` file is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node talks about getting a notification RSS feed and various settings related to notifications, which is not relevant to enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties`. Similarly, the second node discusses overriding default notification templates and installation instructions for extensions, which is also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context explicitly mentions the 'notifications.enabled' setting in 'xwiki.properties' to enable notifications, matching the expected output."
