    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the output partially addresses the question about disabling notifications, but includes several irrelevant links to documentation pages that do not pertain to the issue of managing notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'attaching files and managing attachments', which is unrelated to 'managing notifications or notification settings'. Similarly, the second node is about 'moving and deleting attachments', which does not pertain to 'notification settings or disabling notifications'. The third node lists 'various macros and their functionalities', none of which relate to 'notification settings or managing notifications'. The fourth node is about 'administrating wiki features like users and rights', which is not related to 'notification settings or managing notifications'. The fifth node discusses 'controlling permissions and security modules', which does not relate to 'notification settings or managing notifications'. Lastly, the sixth node lists 'various XWiki extensions', none of which are related to 'managing or disabling notifications'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to automatic following of pages or notification settings as described in the expected output."
