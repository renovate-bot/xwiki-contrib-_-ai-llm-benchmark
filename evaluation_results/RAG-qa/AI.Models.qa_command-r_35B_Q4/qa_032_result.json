    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'group synchronization and customization for OpenID Connect', which is not directly related to authenticating users with access tokens. The second node talks about 'protection levels for cookies and security strategies', which does not address the authentication of users with access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to token-based authentication, JWT, or the specific steps for configuring the LLM application (BETA) extension."
