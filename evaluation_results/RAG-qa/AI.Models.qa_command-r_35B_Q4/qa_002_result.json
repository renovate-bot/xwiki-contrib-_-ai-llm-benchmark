    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first and fourth nodes in the retrieval context are relevant, providing information on how to follow a user to receive notifications and listing ways to receive notifications in XWiki. However, the second node discusses filters and settings without addressing enabling notifications, the third node talks about notification RSS feeds without ensuring notifications are received, and the fifth node is about the 'What's New' application, which is unrelated to general notifications. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant ones.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some details about enabling notifications and following users are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, key instructions like enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and ensuring subscriptions to pages or users are not directly covered.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers following users and default watch settings but lacks specific instructions on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching pages or wikis."
