    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant to the input, with no irrelevant statements present. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, is ranked sixth. This is much lower than the irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'custom notification filters and their behavior', and the second node describing 'the alert menu and notification display', which do not relate to enabling notifications in XWiki. The relevant information should be ranked higher to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 6th node in the retrieval context discusses editing the xwiki.properties file related to notifications, it does not specifically mention setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is a key detail in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides additional information about the XWiki interface and specific extensions but does not address enabling notifications via 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' as stated in the expected output."
