  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the response partially addresses the issue of the unavailable bell icon, but includes several irrelevant statements that do not directly solve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in retrieval context, ranked 6th, discusses how administrators can configure notification settings and edit the xwiki.properties file, which is pertinent to enabling notifications. However, the first five nodes in retrieval context are irrelevant as they discuss topics like 'custom notification filters and their behavior', 'the alert menu and notification display', 'various ways to receive notifications', 'links to various notification-related features', and 'notification email settings and customization', none of which address enabling notifications in the wiki settings. This misranking of irrelevant nodes higher than the relevant one results in the low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context supports the part about editing the xwiki.properties file, there is no explicit mention in any node about enabling notifications or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the xwiki.properties file or setting notifications.enabled to true."
