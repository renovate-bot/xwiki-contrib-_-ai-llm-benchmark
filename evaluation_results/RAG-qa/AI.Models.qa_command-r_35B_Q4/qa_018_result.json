  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the output partially addresses the question about configuring attachment upload restrictions, but includes several irrelevant statements about exports, XWiki syntax, document lifecycle, and default settings, which do not directly relate to the specific requirements of file type and size limits.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides 'detailed steps on setting the maximum attachment size and mentions MIME type restrictions', is ranked fifth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', and the second node about 'ODT and PDF export features', are ranked higher, which lowers the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.44 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context provides detailed steps for setting maximum upload size, aligning with sentences in the expected output, it lacks information on configuring MIME types and specific size limits for images or PDFs, which are crucial parts of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details about setting MIME types in xwiki.properties and the exact steps for setting the size to 10MB.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly outlines setting the maximum upload size but misses configuring MIME types in xwiki.properties. It mentions altering trusted domains, which isn't in expected output. There's a mention of a default setting of 100 GB that's not in the expected output."
