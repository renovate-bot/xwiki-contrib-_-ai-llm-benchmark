  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.50 because the output contains multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly address the question about limiting file uploads in XWiki, which reduces the relevancy. However, the score is not lower because there is still some relevant information addressing the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', which is unrelated to file upload restrictions. The second node talks about 'various administrative applications and extensions in XWiki', not addressing file upload settings. The third node focuses on 'PDF export and styling options in XWiki', which does not relate to configuring file upload restrictions. The fourth node lists 'various system preferences and macros in XWiki', none of which pertain to file upload restrictions. The fifth node contains 'links to image files and references', which are not relevant to the topic of configuring file upload restrictions. The sixth node also provides 'links to image files and references', unrelated to the configuration of file upload restrictions in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the expected output sentences can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context, as the context lacks information on file upload restrictions, MIME type configurations, and attachment size settings.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to configuring MIME types or attachment size settings in XWiki as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not match the expected output; it suggests using a PHP configuration change, which is not mentioned in the expected steps. It also incorrectly states no built-in method exists for limiting attachment size in XWiki when the expected output provides a method."
