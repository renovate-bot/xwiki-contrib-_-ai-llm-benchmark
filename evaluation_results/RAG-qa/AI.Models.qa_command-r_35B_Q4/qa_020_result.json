  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.55 because while the output does address configuring access rights in XWiki, it includes several irrelevant links and information that do not directly relate to the specific task of setting up team-specific access permissions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database efficiency and programming features,' which are unrelated to configuring access controls for teams. The second node is about 'notifications and application ratings,' which do not pertain to setting up team access permissions in XWiki. The third node covers 'using nested pages and subwikis,' which does not directly address configuring team-specific access rights. The fourth node refers to 'managing users and groups,' but does not provide specific guidance on setting access controls for team areas. Finally, the fifth node discusses 'group synchronization and customization,' which does not directly relate to configuring team access permissions in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.12 because only the concept of creating groups for teams (sentence 1) is supported by the 4th node in the retrieval context, while all other sentences in the expected output lack support from the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to access control steps or rights management as outlined in the expected answer.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output fails to provide specific steps for access control configuration, which is a critical element of the expected output. It only vaguely mentions user and group management without detailing steps like creating groups, setting wiki-wide rights, or inheriting rights for sub-pages. It lacks factual accuracy and introduces uncertainty by directing users to external documentation for specific instructions."
