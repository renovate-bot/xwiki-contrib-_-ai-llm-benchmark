  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer mostly addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'programming rights and script execution' but not the specific issue of denying admin rights. The second node lists 'various rights and their properties' without mentioning the denial of admin rights. The third node explains the 'Script' right without relating to denying admin rights. The fourth node is about 'checking access rights programmatically,' which does not address denying admin rights. Lastly, the fifth node discusses 'converting rights during page migration,' which is unrelated to denying admin rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The expected answer states that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, which is supported by the retrieval context indicating that admin rights imply other rights and are not deniable."
