    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the answer provides some relevant steps to deny script rights to a space administrator, but it includes irrelevant URLs and incorrectly references Slack, which detracts from its overall accuracy and relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node describes methods for checking access rights programmatically but does not address the specific question of denying script rights to a space administrator. Similarly, the second node discusses the usage of the checkAccess() method and its importance for security but does not mention the denial of script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention or explicitly state that certain rights cannot be denied if implied by admin rights.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention that rights implied by admin right cannot be denied."
