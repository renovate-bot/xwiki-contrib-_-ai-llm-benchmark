    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the question directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, but does not address the specific configuration needed. The second node mentions the ability of XWiki to authenticate using OpenID Connect, but lacks the specific configuration details. The third node discusses container authentication and mentions the extension, but does not provide the needed configuration details. The fourth node provides links to various guides and mentions different authentication methods, but lacks the specific configuration details. The fifth node provides a table of contents and links to sections related to the OpenID Connect Authenticator, but does not provide the needed configuration details.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' in the 2nd node in the retrieval context supports the expected output, while the rest of the instructions and details are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or setting the `oidc.enableUser` property."
