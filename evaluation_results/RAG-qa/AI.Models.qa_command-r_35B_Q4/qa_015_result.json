    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the input question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining complete alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', which does not relate to enabling user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and installation instructions', missing the specific configuration needed. The third node focuses on 'technical details and metadata of the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', without addressing automatic user activation. Lastly, the fourth node includes 'configuration properties related to OpenID Connect endpoints' but omits the property `oidc.enableUser` or the process for activating user accounts automatically.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 4th node in the retrieval context supports the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and the need to uncomment properties related to OpenID Connect, there is no specific mention of adding or updating properties, restarting the XWiki instance, or ensuring automatic activation of new user accounts upon first-time login.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any reference to adjusting the xwiki.properties file or enabling the oidc.enableUser property for automatic user activation."
