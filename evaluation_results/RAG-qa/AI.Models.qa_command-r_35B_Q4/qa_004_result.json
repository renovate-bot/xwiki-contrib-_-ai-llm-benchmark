  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response effectively addresses how to disable notifications in XWiki, but includes an unnecessary source link that does not directly pertain to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.76 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the first node mentioning 'settings' of the notifications and the third node discussing 'Advanced filtering options' and 'notification settings', are ranked higher. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, like the second node discussing 'following a user and default watch settings' and the fourth node about 'enabling or disabling the email feature', are ranked above other relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while some sentences in the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as the default behavior of page watching and notification settings (supported by nodes 2 and 1), the statement about being notified about changes on your work lacks direct support from any node.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings, but lacks details about automatic page watching and deleting notification filters."
