  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, but it includes a minor irrelevant statement about creating new users in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is relevant and mentions the default group synchronization and the use of the `oidc.groups.mapping` property, is ranked second. However, irrelevant nodes like the first node, which provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator and its installation, and the third node, which provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, are ranked higher than relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.21 because the retrieval context nodes mention configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, but they lack specific steps, examples, and details about locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, as well as saving and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring group synchronization in the xwiki.properties file and the oidc.groups.mapping property but lacks details on setting oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, and saving the file."
