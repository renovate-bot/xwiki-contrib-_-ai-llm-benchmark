  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked third, provides information about group synchronization, mentioning the use of claims and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property. However, irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, such as the first node which discusses authentication management and endpoint configurations without mentioning group synchronization, and the second node which talks about different authentication methods without providing information on configuring group synchronization with OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the general concept of group synchronization and configuration in XWiki, it lacks specific details such as locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, providing examples, and saving changes, which are crucial for a complete match with the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and oidc.groups.mapping but lacks details on configuring oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator, which are present in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output lacks specific steps such as configuring `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.separator`. It introduces `oidc.userinfoclaims` which is not in the expected output and adds a custom synchronization step which is not required. However, it correctly mentions mapping groups and restarting XWiki."
