  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but the inclusion of an unrelated URL slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) is ranked lower than three irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and settings for notifications, the second node is about overriding default notification templates and installation instructions, and the fourth node is about clearing notifications and grouping similar notifications. These should be ranked lower than the third node, which mentions 'Watched Entities' and 'Follow a user', directly relevant to following pages or users to receive notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because several key aspects of the expected output, such as following pages or users for notifications, are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context. However, specific details like defining the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` and the 'network' tab in the user profile are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains information about enabling notifications, following users, and notification settings, but lacks details on following pages, specific instructions for setting `notifications.enabled`, and viewing followed users in the 'network' tab."
