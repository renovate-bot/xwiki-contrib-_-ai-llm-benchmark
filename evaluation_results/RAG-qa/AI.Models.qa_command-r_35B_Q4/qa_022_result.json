  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes a source link that is not directly related to troubleshooting this specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The first node discusses 'Enable and disable the extension' and 'Enabling notifications for all users by default', which is directly related to ensuring notifications are activated. The second node includes 'Follow a user', aligning with the expected output's instruction on following users to receive notifications. The irrelevant nodes, ranked third and fourth, discuss 'Get a notification RSS feed' and 'various notification preferences macros', which do not directly address enabling notifications or following users. Great job on the ranking!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while there are several supportive connections between the expected output and nodes in the retrieval context, such as enabling notifications and following users or pages (related to nodes 1, 2, and 3), there are missing details like the specific mention of 'xwiki.properties' and the 'network' tab for viewing followed users, which are not found in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks specific details about setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` and using the alert menu for following pages."
