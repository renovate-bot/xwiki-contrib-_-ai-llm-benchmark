  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the output partially addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are perfectly ranked above the irrelevant ones. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the expected output is supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as enabling notifications and following pages or users, which are covered by the 1st and 2nd nodes in the retrieval context. However, there is no mention of 'xwiki.properties' or setting 'notifications.enabled', which slightly affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties` and specific steps for following pages or users.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output fails to mention enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and lacks guidance on following pages or users. It includes unrelated information about default settings and notification types, which are not present in the expected output."
