  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user', is ranked first. This directly addresses the input query about customizing user profile fields, ensuring that irrelevant nodes discussing access tokens, endpoints, group synchronization, and in-wiki configuration are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the retrieval context nodes provide detailed information on mapping custom properties and using the `oidc.user.mapping` property (related to sentences 1-3 in the expected output), but they do not mention the need to save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart XWiki, which is covered in sentence 4.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all necessary information about customizing user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, including examples and instructions to save and restart XWiki."
