  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response mostly addresses the task of limiting uploads to images or PDFs of a certain size, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides information about setting the maximum size of attachments and mentions the configuration parameter in XWikiPreferences, is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes such as the first node, which discusses linking to external files and images without addressing upload restrictions, and the second node, which provides general information about XWiki pages without covering attachment restrictions, are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.64 because while nodes in the retrieval context provide detailed steps for configuring maximum upload size and mention the xwiki.properties file, they do not explicitly cover restricting uploads to only images or PDFs of maximum 10MB or configuring allowed mimetypes to block all other types.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions, but lacks specific details on configuring xwiki.properties or setting a 10MB limit."
