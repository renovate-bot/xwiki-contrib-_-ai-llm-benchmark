  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer mostly addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but it includes irrelevant lists of sources that do not directly help with the configuration task.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.71 because the actual output inaccurately claims that you can set rights for each group on their corresponding space and access 'Space Administration', while the retrieval context indicates that the concept of space has been removed from the XWiki UI.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.29 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, specifically the fourth node which 'provides information on XWiki's permission system, including the ability to set view and edit rights at different levels,' and the sixth node which 'outlines the rules for setting rights in XWiki, including wiki-wide and page-level permissions,' are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node, which 'discusses the historical organization of content in XWiki and the concept of Nested Pages,' and the second node, which 'explains the parent/child relationship and the introduction of Nested Pages,' are ranked higher despite not addressing the configuration of access rights for teams. This misordering of relevant and irrelevant nodes results in a lower score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the expected output sentences are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, such as setting rights at different levels and creating groups for each team. However, there is a lack of specific mention in the nodes regarding adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces, which slightly lowers the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights at different levels and inheritance, but lacks specific details about creating groups for each team and setting rights for XWikiAllGroup as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output aligns with expected output on creating groups and setting edit rights, but lacks clarity on setting view rights for 'XWikiAllGroup' and ensuring inheritance for child pages."
