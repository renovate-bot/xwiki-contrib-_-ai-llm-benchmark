  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the answer provides relevant information about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes multiple URLs that are not directly related to the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'properties of a collection object and methods for managing collections in a wiki', which is unrelated to user authentication using access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about authenticating users with access tokens, JWT claims, or configuring the authenticator as described in the expected output."
