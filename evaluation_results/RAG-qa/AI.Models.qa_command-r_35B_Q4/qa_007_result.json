  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant and provides useful information about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes a source URL that doesn't directly address the configuration process, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first three nodes provide detailed information about configuring the `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties, which are directly relevant to setting up group synchronization. The irrelevant nodes, ranked fourth and fifth, discuss installation instructions and authentication management, which do not directly address the group synchronization setup process. Great job on the ranking!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.46 because while nodes in retrieval context provide specific examples and mention key properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', they lack the comprehensive step-by-step instructions present in the expected output, leading to a lower score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains detailed information on configuring group synchronization, including `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, matching the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions to save and restart the XWiki instance."
