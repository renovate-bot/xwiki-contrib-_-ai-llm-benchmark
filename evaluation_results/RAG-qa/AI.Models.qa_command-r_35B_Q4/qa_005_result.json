  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the response is highly relevant and provides useful information on configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes a mention of LDAP authentication, which is not pertinent to the OpenID Connect setup, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly claims that adjustments are needed in the xwiki.properties file for automatic account enabling upon first login using OpenID Connect, whereas the retrieval context states that user accounts are enabled on first login by default in the OpenID Connect configuration.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions the commented-out property '# oidc.enableUser=true', is ranked first. This is directly relevant to enabling user accounts on first login as mentioned in the expected output. Great job on getting the most relevant information right at the top!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context supports the idea of enabling user accounts on first login, it lacks explicit mentions of adding or updating properties, saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, and the automatic enabling of new user accounts via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the exact information about the 'oidc.enableUser' property being set to true, which matches the expected output."
