  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the main response addresses the question about disabling notifications effectively, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the query, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The first three nodes are relevant as they discuss 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode', 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', and 'Auto Watch', which directly relate to modifying notification settings. The irrelevant node, ranked fourth, discusses 'RSS feeds and general notification settings', which is not directly related to disabling notifications for auto-watched pages. Great job on getting everything in the right order!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because most sentences in the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as the 1st node relating to auto-watched mode and the 2nd node relating to notification preferences. However, the sentence about being notified of changes lacks direct support from the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and notification filters, aligning with the expected answer's mention of automatic page tracking and custom filters. However, it lacks explicit details about modifying the 'Suivi automatique des pages' setting and removing filters from 'Filtres personnalis\u00e9s'."
