  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the answer provides some relevant information about disabling notifications, but includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and the settings menu, which is not relevant to disabling notifications or auto-watched pages. Additionally, the fourth node provides general information about different ways to receive notifications, and the fifth node discusses overriding default notification templates and installation instructions, both of which are also not relevant. However, the second and third nodes are correctly ranked higher as they directly address modifying auto-watch settings and managing notification filters.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 1st sentence in the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, the remaining sentences about being notified of changes on your work and deleting filters created automatically are not explicitly supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions auto-watched pages and notification settings but lacks details about modifying auto-watch settings and removing custom filters."
