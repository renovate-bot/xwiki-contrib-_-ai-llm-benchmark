  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response mostly addresses the question about disabling notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not pertain to the query, slightly lowering the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and appropriately ranked, addressing the input query about disabling automatic notifications with precise information on notification settings and preferences.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because nodes in the retrieval context support the expected output's details about automatic page tracking and modifying notification settings (sentences 1, 3, and 4). However, there is no mention in the retrieval context about being notified of changes to your work (sentence 2).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, which aligns with the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit details about modifying notification settings in the user profile.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output lacks emphasis on automatic tracking of pages after significant edits and does not mention altering 'Suivi automatique des pages' specifically. It introduces unrelated information about notification types and global filters instead."
