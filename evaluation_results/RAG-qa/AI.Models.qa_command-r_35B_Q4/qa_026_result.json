  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the response addresses the main question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki, but includes irrelevant statements such as providing a source link and offering further assistance, which do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node in the retrieval context is relevant as it mentions 'xwiki.properties', which directly relates to mapping fields as specified in the input. The subsequent nodes discuss topics like 'container authentication and LDAP', 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator', 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator', and 'configuration guides for specific systems', none of which address user profile field mapping, ensuring they are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context nodes mention customizing user profile fields and using 'oidc.user.mapping', they lack explicit details on example mapping formats, replacing placeholders, and instructions to save and restart XWiki, which are present in the expected output sentences.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about customizing user profile fields or using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in `xwiki.properties`."
