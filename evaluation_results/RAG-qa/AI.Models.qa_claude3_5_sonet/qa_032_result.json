  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For instance, the first node discusses 'group synchronization and customization for OpenID Connect,' which is unrelated to authenticating users with access tokens. Similarly, the second node is about 'protection levels for cookies and security strategies for failed logins,' which does not relate to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication, JWT tokens, or the specific steps to enable and configure the LLM application extension."
