  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response is largely relevant and helpful in addressing the configuration of OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes a mention of LDAP Authenticator, which is not pertinent to the question about OpenID Connect, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which mentions the property '# oidc.enableUser=true' directly related to enabling user accounts on first login, is ranked first. This shows a perfect ranking where relevant information is prioritized over irrelevant contexts discussing domain-based authentication, general OpenID Connect information, various authentication methods, and LDAP settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context's 1st node contains relevant information about enabling user accounts with the property '# oidc.enableUser=true', it lacks details on adding or updating properties, saving the file, restarting XWiki, and the automatic enabling of accounts via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the exact information found in the expected answer, specifically the mention of the 'oidc.enableUser=true' property in the 'xwiki.properties' file.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output correctly identifies the need to set oidc.enableUser=true in xwiki.properties, but lacks specifics about uncommenting the line and restarting XWiki. Provides additional unnecessary information about file location and default settings."
