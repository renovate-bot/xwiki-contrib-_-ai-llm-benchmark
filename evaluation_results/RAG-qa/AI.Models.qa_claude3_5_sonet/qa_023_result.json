  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response mostly addresses the question about enabling notifications for personal actions, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context is ranked first, and it directly addresses the input question by stating, 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter.' Great job on getting it right!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence of the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the second sentence lacks support as there is no mention of 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' or similar settings in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms users don't receive notifications for their own actions by default and mentions the ability to change this setting, aligning well with the expected output. However, it lacks specific mention of 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' in the user profile settings."
