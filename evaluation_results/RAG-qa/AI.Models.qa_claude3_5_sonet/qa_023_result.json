  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but it includes an unnecessary link to XWiki syntax documentation, which is not directly related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node ranked 2nd mentions 'Filter your own events,' which is directly relevant to the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, irrelevant nodes ranked 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th discuss topics such as getting a notification RSS feed, various notification preferences macros, overriding default notification templates, and various ways to be notified in XWiki, which are unrelated to enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and filtering options, but lacks details about disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es'."
