  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the answer provides some relevant information but includes multiple URLs that are not directly related to enabling notifications for one's own activities, which detracts from the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'token generation and JWT claims', which is unrelated to notifications for user activity. Similarly, the second node discusses 'database migration and invalid extensions', which does not pertain to notifications for user activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user activity filters."
