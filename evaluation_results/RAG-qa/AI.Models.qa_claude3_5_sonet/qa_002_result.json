  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki. Great job on providing a focused and helpful answer!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first and fourth nodes in the retrieval context are relevant, discussing how to follow a user and various methods of receiving notifications in XWiki, which are crucial for setting up notifications correctly. However, the second node, ranked higher than the fourth, only discusses filters for notifications without addressing enabling notifications or subscriptions. Additionally, the third node, which talks about RSS feeds and notification settings, does not specifically address enabling notifications or subscribing to content, and the fifth node, discussing the 'What's New' application, is not directly related to the issue of enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while the nodes in retrieval context cover details about enabling notifications through the alert menu, following users, and checking the network tab (sentences 3, 4, 5, and 6), they do not mention enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties`, subscribing to pages or users, or watching a page or its children (sentences 1, 2, and 3).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context covers following users and some notification settings but lacks details on enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` and watching pages or wikis.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides guidance on enabling notifications but lacks specific instructions on setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` to `true` and does not mention following users through the User Index. It includes additional information about version-specific settings and advanced filtering, which are not in the expected output."
