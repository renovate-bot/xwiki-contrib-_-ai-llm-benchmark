  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response is mostly relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes several unrelated links that do not directly address the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node describes properties and methods related to collections in a wiki, which is not relevant to authenticating users with access tokens. The second node discusses access tokens and claims at the UserInfo endpoint, but does not provide information on authenticating users with access tokens in the context of the application LLM.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about authenticating users with access tokens, JWT, or the specific steps and requirements mentioned in the expected output."
