  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the main content of the answer is relevant and addresses the question about limiting file uploads to images or PDFs of a specific size. However, the repeated irrelevant statements about source links that do not directly address the question prevent the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question about configuring file upload restrictions. The first node discusses 'language preferences and translations', the second node talks about 'various applications and features', the third node is about 'PDF export customization', the fourth node lists 'features and macros', and the fifth and sixth nodes contain 'links to image files and references'. None of these nodes address the topic of file upload restrictions, leading to a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not contain any relevant information or nodes that support the expected output, which includes details on file type and size restrictions, MIME type configurations, or specific instructions related to XWikiPreferences.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about configuring MIME types or setting maximum attachment size, which are key elements in the expected output."
