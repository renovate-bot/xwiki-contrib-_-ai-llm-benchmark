  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly states the process of adding 'xwiki_groups' to userinfo claims, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that group synchronization is enabled by adding the claim 'xwiki_groups' to the property 'oidc.userinfoclaims'.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The first three nodes provide detailed information on configuring group synchronization, such as specifying the 'oidc.groups.claim' property, mapping XWiki groups using 'oidc.groups.mapping', and enabling synchronization by adding claims to 'oidc.userinfoclaims'. The irrelevant nodes, ranked fourth and fifth, focus on general configuration and authentication management, which are not directly related to the process of configuring group synchronization. Great job on getting everything in the right order!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.46 because while some nodes in the retrieval context support configuring properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', many specific instructions such as locating and editing the xwiki.properties file, replacing placeholders, and restarting XWiki are missing.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains detailed information on configuring the `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties, which aligns closely with the expected output. However, it lacks explicit instructions on locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file and restarting the XWiki instance."
