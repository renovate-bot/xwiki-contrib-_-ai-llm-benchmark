  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the issue of not receiving notifications directly. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output incorrectly claims 'Vous ne recevez pas de notifications.' while the retrieval context states that users do receive notifications by default when they are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Watched Entities' and 'Follow a user,' is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing RSS feed settings and the second node about overriding notification templates, are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while the retrieval context covers following pages, users, and using the alert menu, it lacks details on activating notifications via the `notifications.enabled` property in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` and specific instructions for following pages or viewing followed users."
