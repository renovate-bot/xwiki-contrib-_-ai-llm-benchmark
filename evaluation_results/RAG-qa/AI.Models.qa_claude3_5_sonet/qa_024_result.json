  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information on how to disable notifications. However, it includes URLs that do not directly address the question about disabling notifications, slightly lowering the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) is ranked lower than multiple irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and various notification settings, but it does not address how to disable automatic notifications or modify notification settings in the user's profile. Similarly, the second node lists various notification preferences macros but does not explain how to disable automatic notifications or modify notification settings in the user's profile.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the retrieval context partially supports the expected output. Specifically, the 1st node in the retrieval context supports sentences 1 and 3 of the expected output by mentioning default notification settings and the notifications menu. The 2nd node supports sentence 4 by referencing notification preferences and custom filters. However, the retrieval context does not specifically mention being notified about changes to one's own work, which affects the completeness of the match.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions auto watch and custom filters preferences but lacks details on modifying the auto-watch setting and removing filters."
