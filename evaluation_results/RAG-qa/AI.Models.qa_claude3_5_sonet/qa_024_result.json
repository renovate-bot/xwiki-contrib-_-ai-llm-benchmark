  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response mostly addresses how to disable notifications, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly answer the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The first three nodes effectively address the issue of 'automatic page following and notification settings', which is directly related to the input query about disabling automatic notifications. The irrelevant node, ranked fourth, discusses 'RSS feeds and general notification settings', which does not pertain to the specific issue at hand.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, aligning with the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit mention of modifying settings for 'Suivi automatique des pages' and removing filters in 'Filtres personnalis\u00e9s'."
