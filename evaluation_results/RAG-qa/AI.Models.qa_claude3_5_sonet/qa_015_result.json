  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user account activation with OpenID Connect. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which is the fourth node, is ranked lower than three irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is unrelated to the query about enabling user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication' but lacks specific details on automatically activating user accounts. The third node covers 'compatibility and installation details' of the OpenID Connect authenticator, but not the necessary configuration for automatic activation. The relevant node, which mentions the `xwiki.properties` file, should be ranked higher as it directly addresses the configuration needed for automatic user account activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 4th node in the retrieval context supports the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and the property 'oidc.enableUser', it lacks details on adding or updating specific properties, restarting the XWiki instance, and the automatic activation of new user accounts upon first login via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about updating the xwiki.properties file or the specific property oidc.enableUser for automatic user activation."
