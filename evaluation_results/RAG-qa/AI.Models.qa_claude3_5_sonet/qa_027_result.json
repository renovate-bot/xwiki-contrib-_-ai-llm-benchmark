  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the main response is highly relevant and provides useful information about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, the inclusion of a link to the user guide for creating new users slightly detracts from the focus on group synchronization.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which directly addresses group synchronization by mentioning the `xwiki.properties` file and the `oidc.groups.claim` property, is ranked lower than the first node. The first node provides general information about prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator, which is less relevant to the specific steps for configuring group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring group synchronization in xwiki.properties and using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks detailed steps and examples found in the expected output."
