  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant information included. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the third node, provides information on group synchronization and mentions the use of claims and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property. However, the first, second, fourth, and fifth nodes are ranked higher or close to the relevant node and focus on topics like 'authentication management and endpoints configuration', 'container authentication and LDAP', 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication', and 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension', which are not directly related to group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the general concept of configuring group synchronization in XWiki, it lacks specific details such as locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, providing examples, and instructions for saving and restarting XWiki, which are crucial for a complete understanding.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks details on configuring oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator, which are present in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks key instructions such as setting 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.separator'. It introduces 'oidc.userinfoclaims' and mentions event listeners, which are not present in the expected output."
