  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is mostly relevant and provides useful information on disabling notifications in XWiki. However, it includes a source link and a heading that do not directly address the question, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions; the actual output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, discussing 'settings' in the notifications menu, which aligns with changing notification settings in the user profile. However, irrelevant nodes, such as the second node discussing 'following a user and default watch settings,' and the third node about 'filtering notifications,' are ranked higher than another relevant node, the fifth node, which mentions 'default auto-watched mode' and user preferences.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job on aligning the information perfectly!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and user profile settings but lacks specific details about automatic page watching and deleting filters in the 'Custom Filters' list.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output does not mention automatic page watching or deleting filters from 'Custom Filters'. It discusses default behaviors in different versions and managing notifications, which diverges from expected focus on automatic watching and filter deletion."
