  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and mostly addresses the question about disabling notifications in XWiki. However, the statement 'Understanding the Default Behavior' is slightly vague and doesn't directly contribute to the solution, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, providing information about accessing 'settings' to change notification settings. However, the second node, which is about 'following users and default watch settings,' and the third node, discussing 'filtering notifications and hidden pages,' are not directly related to disabling notifications, yet they are ranked higher than the fifth relevant node that discusses 'administrators changing users' notification settings and auto-watching behavior.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while nodes in the retrieval context support the idea of automatic page watching and changing settings in the user profile (related to sentences 1 and 3), they do not explicitly mention notifications about changes on one's work or deleting existing notification filters (related to sentences 2 and 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings but lacks details on automatic page watching and deleting notification filters."
