  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response largely addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but includes several irrelevant links that do not directly assist with the specific configuration task described.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the claim that 'View' permission will still be inherited from the wiki-level settings contradicts the retrieval context, which states that page-level permissions override wiki-wide permissions.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.85 because most relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. The first node discusses 'rights inheritance and administration features' and 'inheritance of access rights,' which are relevant to setting view and edit permissions in XWiki. The second node explains the 'Nested Spaces' concept and rights management, also relevant to configuring space-level rights for teams. However, the third node, which is about string formatting and user identification in OpenID Connect, is not relevant to setting view/edit permissions in XWiki and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the fifth node, which describes the emulation of spaces and pages in XWiki, is not directly related to configuring view/edit permissions for teams and should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while several key concepts such as creating groups, setting wiki-wide and space-level rights, and inheriting rights for child pages are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, some introductory and summarizing sentences, as well as the reminder to adjust rights, are not directly referenced in the nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights at different levels and inheritance, but lacks specific details about creating groups for each team and setting rights specifically for XWikiAllGroup or individual team spaces.",
    "Correctness": "The Actual Output includes all critical details such as setting global view rights, space-specific edit rights, and inheriting rights for child pages. It lacks explicit mention of creating groups for each team, but implies it in the instructions."
