  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and provides a clear solution to configuring access rights in XWiki, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly suggests that edit rights can be denied at the wiki level and only allowed at the space level, whereas the retrieval context clarifies that denying edit rights at the wiki level prevents page creation unless explicitly allowed at the Page & Children level.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node (rank 5) discusses 'explicit setting of permissions for groups or users and the implications of the EDIT right', which is directly related to configuring access rights for teams. However, irrelevant nodes ranked higher (ranks 1-4) discuss topics such as 'how pages and spaces are created and managed', 'parent/child relationship and Nested Pages', 'various macros and their purposes', and 'link syntax', none of which address access control or rights management.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights and the concept of spaces and pages, but it lacks specific steps about creating groups, setting wiki-wide rights, and inheriting rights for child pages."
