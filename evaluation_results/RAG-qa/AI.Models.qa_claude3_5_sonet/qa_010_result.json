  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response largely addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, but it is not higher due to the inclusion of multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly assist with the configuration task.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.29 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'the history and structure of content organization in XWiki,' which is not related to configuring team-specific permissions. The second node explains 'the parent/child relationship and the concept of Nested Pages,' which also does not address the input question. The third node is about 'string formatting and OpenID Connect user properties,' unrelated to the task. The relevant node, ranked fourth, provides 'information on XWiki's permission system, mentioning the ability to set view and edit rights,' which is pertinent to the input. Another relevant node, ranked sixth, 'outlines the basic rules of XWiki's permission system,' which is also relevant. The presence of these relevant nodes contributes to the score, but their lower ranking compared to irrelevant nodes prevents a higher score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the expected output sentences are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as nodes 4 and 6 aligning with key steps like creating groups and setting rights. However, there's a lack of information in the retrieval context regarding adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces, which slightly impacts the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions rights inheritance and setting rights at different levels, but lacks specific details about creating groups for each team and setting rights specifically for 'XWikiAllGroup' or individual team spaces as outlined in the expected output."
