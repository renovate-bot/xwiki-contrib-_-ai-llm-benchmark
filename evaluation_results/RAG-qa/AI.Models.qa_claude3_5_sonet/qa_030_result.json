  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the response mostly addresses the question about configuring access rights in XWiki, but it includes several irrelevant links that do not directly relate to the specific task of setting view and edit permissions for team spaces.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses the structure of a page in XWiki, but it does not provide any information about configuring access rights or spaces. The second node talks about modifying resources using XML and REST API, which is unrelated to setting access rights for spaces in XWiki. The third node is about managing comments and attachments, which does not relate to configuring space access rights in XWiki. The fourth node explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki, but it does not address access rights or how to configure them. The fifth node is about migration actions and adapting code, which is not related to configuring access rights for spaces in XWiki. Lastly, the sixth node discusses configuration display settings in XWiki, which does not pertain to setting access rights for teams in spaces.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context. The retrieval context lacks information on specific steps for achieving access control in XWiki, such as creating groups, defining rights at different levels, or ensuring visibility and modification rights for teams.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information on creating groups, setting rights at wiki and space levels, and inheriting rights for child pages, which are key points in the expected output."
