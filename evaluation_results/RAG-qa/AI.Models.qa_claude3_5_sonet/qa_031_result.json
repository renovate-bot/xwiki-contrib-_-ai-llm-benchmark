  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the output mostly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple source links and a general introductory phrase that do not directly contribute to answering the question, thus preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because some relevant nodes are ranked lower than irrelevant ones. The first node is about 'LDAP configuration' and not about 'token-based authentication', yet it is ranked higher than the second node, which is relevant as it 'discusses the configuration of authorized applications'. Similarly, the third node focuses on 'OpenID Connect scopes', which is not directly related, but is ranked higher than the fourth node that 'describes the JWT token authenticator', which is directly relevant. This mix of rankings results in a balanced score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key aspects of the expected output, such as the use of JWTs and configuration steps, are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, there are missing details regarding generating a JWT token with specific claims and including the token in the 'Authorization' header, which are crucial for a complete understanding.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and using JWTs, which aligns with the expected answer. However, details about specific JWT claims and the use of Ed25519 keys are not explicitly mentioned.",
    "Correctness": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the use of JWT for authentication, the need to set `xwiki.authentication.authclass`, and configuring 'Authorized Applications'. However, it inaccurately mentions a fallback authenticator which isn't in the Expected Output, and misses details on specific claims required in the JWT."
