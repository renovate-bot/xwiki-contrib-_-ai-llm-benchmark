  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.53 because while the output contains some relevant information about authenticating users with access tokens, it is overshadowed by multiple irrelevant statements and fragments that do not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node in the retrieval context is about 'LDAP configuration and does not mention token-based authentication or JWT', which should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node discusses 'OpenID Connect scopes and response types', which are unrelated to the expected output and should be lower. However, the second node is correctly ranked as it describes 'Authorized Applications Configuration', relevant to authenticating using tokens. The fourth node also supports the expected output by explaining 'how the extension allows external applications to authenticate users with JWT'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while the retrieval context provides detailed information about authenticating users with JWTs, including enabling the token authenticator and configuring authorized applications (supported by nodes 2 and 4 in the retrieval context), it lacks explicit details on generating JWT tokens with required claims and including the token in the 'Authorization' header, which are crucial steps mentioned in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes details on enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and JWT requirements, but lacks specific information on JWT claims and the use of Ed25519 key."
