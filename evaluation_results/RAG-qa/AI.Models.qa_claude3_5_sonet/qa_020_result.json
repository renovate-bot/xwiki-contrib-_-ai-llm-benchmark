  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because the output contains several irrelevant statements, such as source links and example structures, which do not directly address the configuration of permissions in XWiki. However, the score is not lower because the relevant parts of the output likely provide some useful information on configuring permissions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database efficiency and programming features', which do not relate to configuring access controls for team areas. The second node is about 'notifications and extensions in XWiki', which also does not provide information on setting access rights for team areas. Subsequent nodes continue to address unrelated topics such as 'nested pages and subwikis', 'managing users and groups', and 'group synchronization and customization', none of which directly address the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to access control steps, group creation, or rights management as outlined in the expected output."
