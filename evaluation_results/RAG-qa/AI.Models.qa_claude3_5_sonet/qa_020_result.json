  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer mostly addresses the configuration question in XWiki, but the presence of multiple source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because only the fourth node in the retrieval context is relevant, as it provides a link to managing users and groups, which is pertinent to creating groups for each team and setting user rights. However, the first three nodes are ranked higher and are irrelevant, discussing topics like XWiki's database efficiency, notifications, and nested pages, which do not relate to configuring access controls for teams. Additionally, the fifth node, also irrelevant, covers group synchronization and customization, not directly addressing the configuration of access controls for teams in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.14 because only the sentence about creating groups for each team (sentence 1) is supported by node 4 in the retrieval context, while all other sentences in the expected output lack corresponding information in the retrieval context nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to setting access controls, creating groups, or managing rights in XWiki as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output accurately reflects group creation and setting of 'View' and 'Edit' rights but includes additional 'Delete' rights not present in the expected output. The recursive rights inheritance is correctly mentioned."
