  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about configuring XWiki permissions for different teams. However, it includes several links to general XWiki documentation that do not directly address the specific configuration question, which slightly reduces the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various actions that can be performed in XWiki' but does not provide specific steps on configuring access control for teams. The second node describes 'the concept of wikis and subwikis' without addressing the specific access control requirements for teams. The third node lists 'various macros and their functionalities' without providing information related to configuring access control for teams. The fourth node mentions 'applications and extensions' without guidance on setting up access control for teams. The fifth node discusses 'language preferences and translations,' which is unrelated to configuring access control for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, setting wiki-wide rights, setting area-level rights, or inheriting rights for child pages."
