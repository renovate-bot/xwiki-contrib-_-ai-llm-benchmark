  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. However, it includes several irrelevant links to documentation that do not directly address the specific customization query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes (first, second, fourth, and fifth nodes). For example, the first node discusses 'various authentication methods for the XWiki RESTful API' which is not related to mapping user profile fields, and the second node provides information about the 'OpenID Connect Authenticator extension' but does not address mapping user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all the information in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about customizing user profile fields in xwiki.properties or using oidc.user.mapping."
