  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response is mostly relevant and addresses the question about customizing user profile fields mapping in XWiki. However, it includes a source link that does not directly contribute to the solution, slightly affecting its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect provider endpoints,' but does not mention mapping user profile fields. The second node provides information about 'container authentication and other authentication methods,' which does not address mapping user profile fields. The third node describes 'the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, its developer, and installation details,' but lacks information on mapping user profile fields. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' which is unrelated to mapping user profile fields. The fifth node provides 'configuration guides for specific systems and mentions configuration files,' but does not detail how to map user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties`, which is crucial in the expected output."
