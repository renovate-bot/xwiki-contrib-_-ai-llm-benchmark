  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the response partially addresses the question but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because relevant nodes, like the second node explaining that 'programming rights, which include script rights, are tied to administrative permissions and cannot be denied separately,' and the third node mentioning 'administrative rights imply script rights,' are ranked after the first node. The first node is irrelevant as it discusses 'language preferences and translations in XWiki,' which is unrelated to script rights. Additionally, the fourth and fifth nodes, which discuss 'checking access rights programmatically' and 'executing tasks with specific user rights,' are also irrelevant and ranked after relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is perfectly aligned with the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not explicitly mention that admin rights cannot be denied, which is a key point in the expected output. It only lists rights and their properties without addressing the specific case of admin rights being non-deniable.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly explains that administrative rights, including 'SCRIPT', cannot be individually denied, aligning with the expected output that such rights cannot be refused. However, it adds additional information about rights inheritance not explicitly mentioned in the expected output."
