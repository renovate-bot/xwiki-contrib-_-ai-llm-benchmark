  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the response contains several irrelevant links that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications, but it still provides some relevant information.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'various XWiki applications like Meeting Application, Forum Application, and Ideas Application,' which does not relate to enabling notifications. Similarly, the second node describes 'access rights and the use of the AuthorExecutor role,' which is also unrelated to enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about enabling notifications, following pages or users, or configuring notification settings in xwiki.properties."
