    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes a source link that doesn't directly address the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node contains 'image links and references to various projects, which are unrelated to the topic of enabling notifications in XWiki.' The second node 'consists of image links and references, which do not provide any information about notifications settings or configurations.' The third node 'includes image links and project references, offering no relevant information about notification settings in XWiki.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to enabling notifications or following pages and users as described in the expected output."
