  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the actual output incorrectly attributes the Alert menu to the 'Alerts Application', whereas the retrieval context specifies that the Notifications Application is responsible for this content.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in retrieval context, which mentions editing the `xwiki.properties` file to enable notifications, is ranked sixth. The first five nodes in retrieval context are irrelevant as they discuss topics like 'custom notification filters', 'Alert menu', 'different ways to receive notifications', 'various settings and filters', and 'notification email settings', none of which address enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions editing the xwiki.properties file (node 5), it lacks the specific instruction to set 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is crucial for the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention enabling notifications via `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`, and introduces additional information about applications and permissions that are not in the expected output."
