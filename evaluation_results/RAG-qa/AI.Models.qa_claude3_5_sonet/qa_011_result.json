  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of the notification bell not being available, but it includes a source link that does not directly address this specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Everything aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the sixth node, mentions 'editing the xwiki.properties file' to enable notifications, and should be ranked higher. However, it is ranked lower than five irrelevant nodes that discuss topics like 'custom notification filters', 'Alert menu', 'different ways to receive notifications', 'various notification settings', and 'customizing notification emails', none of which address enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context nodes mention configuring notifications and editing the xwiki.properties file (supporting sentence 1), they do not specifically mention the `notifications.enabled` setting or setting it to `true` (unsupporting sentence 2).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`."
