  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked first, directly addresses the input by explaining how to 'associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and provides an example of mapping. The irrelevant nodes, which discuss topics like 'scopes and response types', 'endpoints and HTTP methods', 'group synchronization', and 'in-wiki configuration', are correctly ranked lower as they do not relate to customizing user profile fields in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because most of the expected output is supported by the 3rd node in the retrieval context, which covers customizing user profile fields and provides examples of mapping. However, the retrieval context lacks information about saving and restarting XWiki to apply changes, which affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the information about customizing user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, including examples matching the expected answer."
