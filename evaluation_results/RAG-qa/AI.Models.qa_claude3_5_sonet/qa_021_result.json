  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant to the issue of the notification bell not appearing, with only a minor irrelevant detail about XWiki syntax documentation that slightly detracts from the focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior', the second node lists 'various notification-related links and settings', the third node provides 'links to notification preferences and macros', the fourth node describes 'the notification application and its features', and the fifth node discusses 'obtaining an RSS feed for notifications and settings'. None of these nodes mention 'enabling notifications in the wiki settings', which is relevant to the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, which is required in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not address the activation of notifications via `xwiki.properties` as mentioned in the expected output. Instead, it provides troubleshooting steps for visible alerts and extensions, which deviates from the expected content."
