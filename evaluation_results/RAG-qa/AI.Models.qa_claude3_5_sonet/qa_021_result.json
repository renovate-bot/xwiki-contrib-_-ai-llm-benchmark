    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the issue directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'how to get a notification RSS feed and settings related to notifications,' which does not address enabling notifications in the wiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
