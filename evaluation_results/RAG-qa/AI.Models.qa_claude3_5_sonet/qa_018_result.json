  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about limiting uploads to images or PDFs with a maximum size of 10 MB, but it includes irrelevant URLs that do not directly contribute to the solution.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.62 because the actual output incorrectly claims restrictions on file types and sizes that are not mentioned in the retrieval context, such as a 10 MB limit and specific MIME types like application/pdf.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes, ensuring precise and accurate retrieval.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.45 because while the retrieval context provides detailed steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (sentences 7-11), it lacks information on configuring allowed MIME types (sentences 1-6).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions steps to change the maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions but lacks specific details on configuring MIME types in 'xwiki.properties' and setting the size to 10MB."
