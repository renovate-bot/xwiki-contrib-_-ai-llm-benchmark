  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and provides a clear explanation of the setup process, with only a minor mention of lacking specific configuration details that slightly detracts from a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and endpoints for OpenID Connect' but lacks information on 'group synchronization or configuration in xwiki.properties'. The second node covers 'container authentication and other methods like LDAP', missing details on 'group synchronization or specific properties needed for OpenID Connect group claims'. The third node mentions 'OpenID Connect and automatic synchronization' but lacks specifics on 'configuring group synchronization in XWiki using xwiki.properties'. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' without relating to 'configuration of group synchronization'. Lastly, the fifth node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator' without addressing 'group synchronization setup'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete lack of relevant information in the context provided.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks details on configuring group synchronization properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', which are essential in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks specific instructions for 'oidc.groups.separator' and 'oidc.groups.mapping' configuration, and does not mention restarting XWiki to apply changes, deviating from critical steps in the expected output."
