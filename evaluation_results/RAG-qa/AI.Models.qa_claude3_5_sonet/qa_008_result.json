  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the response mostly addresses the question about configuring attachment restrictions, but includes irrelevant details such as a link to a general guide and advice on clearing the browser's cache, which are not directly related to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked third, provides information about setting the maximum size of an attachment and mentions the XWikiPreferences document, which is directly related to configuring attachment size limits. However, irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, such as the first node, which discusses linking to external files and backlinks indexation, and the second node, which provides an overview of XWiki's structure and features, neither of which address attachment upload restrictions or size limits.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.73 because while several sentences regarding the configuration of mimetypes and maximum attachment size are supported by nodes in the retrieval context (particularly nodes 3 and 4), introductory and example sentences lack direct support from the context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details on configuring 'xwiki.properties' for mimetypes and setting size to 10MB."
