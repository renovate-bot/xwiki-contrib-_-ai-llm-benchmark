  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the answer is highly relevant and provides a clear solution, but it includes a minor irrelevant statement about XWiki syntax that is not directly related to configuring attachment settings.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node provides detailed steps on how to set the maximum size of an attachment, which is directly relevant to configuring the maximum attachment size to 10MB. Irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing moving attachments and refactoring pages (second node), whitelists and blacklists for attachment downloads (third node), linking to external files and backlinks indexation (fourth node), and linking to attachments and anchors (fifth node), are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.45 because while the retrieval context provides detailed steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (Steps 2.1 to 2.5), it does not mention configuring allowed mimetypes or editing the `xwiki.properties` file (Step 1).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains steps to set the maximum attachment size and mentions mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details on configuring the `xwiki.properties` file and the exact mimetype allowList."
