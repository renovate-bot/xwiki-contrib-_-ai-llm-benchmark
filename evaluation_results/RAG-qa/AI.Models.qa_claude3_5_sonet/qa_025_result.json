  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and addresses the main question about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes a minor irrelevant reference to the XWiki RESTful API, which slightly detracts from the overall focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For instance, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts. Similarly, the second node discusses container authentication without detailing the required configuration for automatic user account activation. The third node describes the functionality of the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not mention the specific property `oidc.enableUser` or the `xwiki.properties` file. The fourth node discusses various authentication methods for the XWiki RESTful API but lacks information on configuring automatic user account activation with OpenID Connect. Lastly, the fifth node lists various endpoints and customization options but does not provide the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while there is some alignment with the general concept of OpenID Connect and automatic user authentication in the retrieval context, it lacks specific details about the property 'oidc.enableUser', its value, and the steps to save the file and restart the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or setting the `oidc.enableUser` property."
