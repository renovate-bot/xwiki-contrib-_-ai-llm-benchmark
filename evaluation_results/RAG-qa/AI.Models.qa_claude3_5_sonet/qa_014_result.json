  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the provided URLs are not relevant to the question about disabling notifications, which detracts from the overall relevance of the answer.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'XWiki Syntax and formatting features', which does not help in answering the question about disabling notifications. Similarly, the second node describes 'an extension for authenticating users with JSON Web Tokens', which is also unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about automatic page following, notification settings, or custom filters as mentioned in the expected output."
