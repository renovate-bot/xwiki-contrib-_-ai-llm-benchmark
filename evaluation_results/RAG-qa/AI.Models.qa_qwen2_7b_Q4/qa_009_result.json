  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant and effectively addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. However, it includes a repeated irrelevant statement about a source URL, which slightly detracts from a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses programming rights and script execution but does not address denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node lists various rights and their default states but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator. The third node explains the script right and its default settings but does not address the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator. The fourth node provides technical details about checking access rights but does not relate to denying script rights to a space administrator. The fifth node discusses converting rights during page migration but does not address denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, matching the expected output."
