  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response mostly addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but it includes unrelated source links that slightly detract from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Everything aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node in the retrieval context is about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki,' which is unrelated to the question about script rights, yet it is ranked higher than relevant nodes. Additionally, the fourth node discusses 'checking access rights programmatically,' and the fifth node talks about 'executing code with different user rights,' both of which do not directly address the question and are ranked higher than they should be. However, the second and third nodes are relevant as they discuss 'programming and script rights in XWiki' and provide a 'detailed list of rights,' respectively, which are pertinent to the input question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context, specifically by the 3rd node, which confirms that admin rights cannot be denied. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that admin rights imply other rights and are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that admin rights cannot be refused, as mentioned in the expected output."
