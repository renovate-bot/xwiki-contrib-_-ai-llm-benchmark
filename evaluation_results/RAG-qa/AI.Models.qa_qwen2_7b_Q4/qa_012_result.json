  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because the output contains several irrelevant links that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications. However, the score is not lower because the relevant parts of the output do attempt to address the notification issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various applications like Meeting Application, Forum Application, and Ideas Application,' which are not related to notifications settings. Similarly, the second node talks about 'access rights and executing tasks with specific user rights,' which is unrelated to enabling or configuring notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about enabling notifications, following pages or users, or configuring notification settings."
