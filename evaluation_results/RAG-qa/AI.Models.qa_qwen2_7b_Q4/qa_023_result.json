  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.60 because the output includes source links that do not directly address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, which makes it partially relevant but not fully aligned with the input query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in retrieval context, ranked first, directly addresses the input question by stating 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' ensuring that all irrelevant nodes are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, with no unsupportive reasons identified. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions, and this can be changed by adjusting the 'Own event filter'. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section in the user profile settings.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly describes disabling a filter to receive notifications on personal activities, aligning with expected output. However, it lacks mention of the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section for modifying these settings."
