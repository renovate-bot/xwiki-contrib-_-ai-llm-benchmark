  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own activity, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states, 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is ranked first. This directly addresses the input question about receiving notifications for one's own actions, while the irrelevant nodes, discussing topics like RSS feeds, general notification settings, and technical aspects, are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence of the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the information about disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' is not found in any node in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the option to change this setting. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section."
