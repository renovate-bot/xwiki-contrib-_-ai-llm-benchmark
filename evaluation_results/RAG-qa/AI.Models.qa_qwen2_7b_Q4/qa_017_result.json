  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the overall response is highly relevant and addresses the question well, but it includes a redundant statement about 'Konfiguration des Anbieters zur XWiki' which slightly detracts from the conciseness.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node mentioning 'Group synchronization' and linking to a section with likely relevant information is ranked fourth. The irrelevant nodes, such as the first node which provides general information about OpenID Connect and XWiki without specific steps, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.85 because while the retrieval context covers most aspects of configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, it lacks explicit instructions for opening the 'xwiki.properties' file with a text editor (sentence 2) and saving the file and restarting the XWiki instance (sentence 7).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization but lacks detailed steps and specific properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` found in the expected output."
