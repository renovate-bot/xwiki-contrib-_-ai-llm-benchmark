  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the main response addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, but several irrelevant links were included, which detract from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is a link to an image and does not provide any information related to denying script rights to a domain administrator. Similarly, the tenth node discusses Kerberos authentication and LDAP configuration, which is unrelated to the question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence does not match any part of the nodes in retrieval context, which discuss images, LDAP configurations, and form utilization.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to the admin rights or their implications in XWiki."
