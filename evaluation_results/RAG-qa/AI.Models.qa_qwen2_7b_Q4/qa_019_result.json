  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the response partially addresses the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator, but includes irrelevant details such as source links and unrelated advice, which prevent it from achieving a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. The first node discusses 'form validation' without mentioning script rights or administrative permissions. The second node covers 'template providers and page creation,' which is unrelated to the topic of script rights. The third node talks about a 'custom right check class and configuration' but does not address denying script rights to an area administrator. Therefore, irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, resulting in a low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence about rights and permissions in XWiki is not supported by any information in the nodes in retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about XWiki not supporting denial of rights implied by admin rights.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides methods to deny script rights, which contradicts the expected output stating it is unsupported. Also, the actual output lacks the explicit statement that admin-implied rights cannot be denied."
