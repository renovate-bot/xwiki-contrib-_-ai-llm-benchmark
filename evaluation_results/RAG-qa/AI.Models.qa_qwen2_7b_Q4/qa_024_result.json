  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the main content addresses how to disable notifications, but it includes irrelevant links that do not directly pertain to the question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which discusses 'Auto Watch' and 'Default Watch Settings' (rank 3), is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node only talks about getting a notification RSS feed and settings menu, which does not help with disabling automatic notifications. Similarly, the second node lists notification preferences macros without explaining how to disable automatic notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context nodes mention default notification settings and accessing notification settings, they do not specifically mention being notified of changes to your work or deleting existing notification filters.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions auto watch preferences and custom notification filters, but lacks explicit details about modifying the 'Suivi automatique des pages' setting and removing existing filters."
