  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response mostly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context is relevant as it 'provides information about configuring authorized applications, which is relevant to using access tokens for authentication,' and the fourth node 'describes the extension that allows authentication using JWT,' both supporting the input query. However, the first node discusses 'LDAP configuration and local account login settings, which are unrelated to token-based authentication,' and the third node 'lists claims that can be requested in access tokens, but it does not directly relate to the process of authenticating users with access tokens,' which should be ranked lower. Additionally, the fifth node 'discusses general authentication mechanisms in XWiki, which does not specifically address the use of access tokens or JWT for authentication,' further affecting the precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key aspects such as authenticating users with JWTs, enabling the token authenticator, and configuring authorized applications are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, details about generating a JWT token with specific claims and including it in the 'Authorization' header are missing.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about configuring authorized applications and enabling the token authenticator, which aligns with the expected answer. However, specific details about JWT claims and the use of Ed25519 keys are not explicitly mentioned."
