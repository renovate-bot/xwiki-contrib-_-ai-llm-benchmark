  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes multiple irrelevant statements providing source links that do not directly contribute to the answer.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node, ranked 1, discusses 'LDAP authentication settings, which are unrelated to token-based authentication or JWTs,' and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node, ranked 3, 'discusses OpenID Connect scopes and response types, which are not directly related to the use of access tokens or JWTs for authentication,' and should also be ranked lower. However, the second node, ranked 2, 'provides information on configuring authorized applications, which is relevant to using access tokens for authentication,' and the fourth node, ranked 4, 'describes the use of JWTs for authentication, which directly relates to the expected output about authenticating users with access tokens,' are correctly identified as relevant, contributing to the current score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while nodes in the retrieval context support several key aspects of the expected output, such as authenticating users with JWTs and configuring authorized applications (nodes 2 and 4), they lack information on generating JWT tokens with specific claims and including them in the 'Authorization' header.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains information about enabling the token authenticator and configuring authorized applications, but lacks details on JWT claims, signing key requirements, and the specific use of the 'Authorization' header.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly mentions the use of the LLM Application Authenticator and JWT for authentication, aligning with the expected output. However, it inaccurately includes OpenID Connect and omits details on token claims and Ed25519 key, which affects factual accuracy."
