  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses the 'Clear All' link, grouping notifications, and notification strategies, but does not address enabling notifications or subscribing to pages/users. Additionally, the second node lists dependencies for the notifications extension, which is not relevant to the question of why notifications are not being received.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only the instruction to enable notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties` (sentence 2) is supported by the 5th node in the retrieval context, while other instructions related to subscribing to pages or users, watching locations, and following users are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and the alert menu but lacks details on subscribing to pages or users and viewing the network tab in the user profile."
