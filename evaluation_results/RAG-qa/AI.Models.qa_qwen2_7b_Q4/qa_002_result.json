  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job maintaining accuracy!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.81 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. For example, the first node is relevant as it explains how to follow a user to receive notifications, which is pertinent to the query. However, the second node, which discusses filtering notifications and hidden pages, is not directly related to enabling notifications and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the fifth node about the 'What's New' application does not address the issue of not receiving notifications and should also be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some sentences, like those about using the 'alert' menu (node 4) and following users (node 1), are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, key details such as enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and subscribing to pages or users are not covered.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on following users and receiving notifications, but lacks details on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching pages or wikis.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides troubleshooting steps but misses specific instructions like setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`. It also diverges into other topics like RSS feeds, which are not mentioned in the expected output."
