  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but the inclusion of an unrelated URL slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) discussing 'Follow a user' and 'Watched Entities' is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed, settings, and enabling/disabling notification types, which is unrelated to enabling notifications or following pages/users. Similarly, the second node is about overriding default notification templates and installation instructions, which is also unrelated.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.62 because while the retrieval context covers following pages or users and activating notifications through the alert menu, it lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` and viewing the list of followed users in the 'network' tab.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`, and the specific steps for following pages or users."
