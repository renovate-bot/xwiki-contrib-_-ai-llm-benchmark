  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help resolve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node provides information on ensuring notifications are activated, and the second node aligns with following users for notifications. The third node, discussing RSS feeds and notification settings, and the fourth node, listing various notification preferences, do not directly address enabling notifications or following users and are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while nodes in the retrieval context support some key concepts like enabling notifications and following users (related to sentences 1, 2, 3, and 4), they lack specific details such as setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties', the alert menu, receiving all notifications from a user, and the user profile network tab (related to sentences 2, 3, 5, and 6).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting 'notifications.enabled' to true in 'xwiki.properties' and specifics on following pages or users."
