  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about disabling notifications in XWiki without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the fifth node, mentions the ability for users to change their own notification settings and the default auto-watched mode, but it is ranked lower than four irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and general notification settings without addressing disabling notifications. The second node talks about following a user and default watch settings, lacking information on disabling notifications. The third node discusses filtering notifications and hidden pages without mentioning disabling notifications. The fourth node is about enabling and disabling email notifications at the server level, not directly related to user-level settings. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while nodes in the retrieval context support the idea of automatic page watching and accessing notification settings (related to sentences 1 and 3), they do not cover notifications for changes on one's work or deleting filters (related to sentences 2 and 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings but lacks details on automatic page watching and deleting notification filters."
