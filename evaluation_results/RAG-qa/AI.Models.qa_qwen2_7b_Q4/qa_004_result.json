  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response effectively addresses the query about disabling notifications in XWiki. However, it includes a source reference that does not directly contribute to the solution, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that XWiki allows disabling notifications about a user's own activity by default in newer versions, whereas the retrieval context states that users do not receive notifications about their own activity unless specifically targeted.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.59 because relevant nodes, like the second node discussing 'default watch settings' and the third node on 'filtering notifications', are ranked after an irrelevant first node that 'discusses obtaining an RSS feed for notifications'. Additionally, the fifth node, which is relevant as it 'mentions the ability for administrators to configure default notification settings', is ranked after the fourth node that 'focuses on enabling and disabling email notifications at an administrative level', which is less relevant to the user's query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default watch settings and user profile settings but lacks details on automatic page watching and deleting custom filters.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes steps to manage notifications, which is additional information not in the expected output. It lacks the mention of automatic page watching and modifying notification filters from the 'Custom Filters' list, which are key elements in the expected output."
