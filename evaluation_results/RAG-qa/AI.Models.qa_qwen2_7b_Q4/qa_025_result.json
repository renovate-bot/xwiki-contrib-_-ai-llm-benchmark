  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.97 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the main question about configuring user account activation via OpenID Connect. However, it includes a minor irrelevant detail about the XWiki RESTful API, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node 'describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, its developer, and installation details, but does not mention the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts.' Similarly, the second node 'discusses container authentication and mentions OpenID Connect briefly but does not provide the specific configuration details required to solve the problem.' These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or setting the `oidc.enableUser` property."
