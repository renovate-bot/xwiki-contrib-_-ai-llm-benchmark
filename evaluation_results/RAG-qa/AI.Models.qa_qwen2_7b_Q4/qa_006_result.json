  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.97 because the response is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. The only minor issue is the inclusion of a source link, which is not directly necessary for the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly claims that XWiki uses an AuthenticationHandler class, while the retrieval context specifies that the authentication management class is org.xwiki.contrib.oidc.auth.OIDCAuthServiceImpl.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context is ranked first and directly addresses the input query by stating 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and providing an example of 'oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}', which is exactly about customizing user profile fields. The irrelevant nodes, such as the second node discussing access to various claims like 'profile', 'email', 'address', and 'phone', and the third node focusing on OpenID Connect provider endpoints and HTTP headers, are correctly ranked lower as they do not pertain to the customization of user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the information in the nodes in retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes detailed instructions on mapping user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property, matching the expected output's explanation of customizing user profile fields in the `xwiki.properties` file."
