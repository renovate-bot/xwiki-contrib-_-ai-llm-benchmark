  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and provides examples of 'oidc.user.mapping', is ranked first. This directly relates to mapping additional user profile fields, while the irrelevant nodes, such as the second node discussing scopes and response types, the third node about configuring endpoints and adding custom HTTP headers, the fourth node on group synchronization and customization of templates and listeners, and the fifth node on in-wiki configuration for OIDC authenticator and client configurations, are all ranked lower, maintaining perfect contextual precision. Great job on getting it spot on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports most of the expected output by detailing how to map user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property and providing examples. However, it lacks information about saving the `xwiki.properties` file and restarting XWiki, which affects the completeness of the retrieval.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the information from the expected answer, including the ability to map additional user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, with examples provided.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output accurately describes the process of mapping fields using `oidc.user.mapping` and provides a clear example similar to expected output. However, it introduces additional details about syntax and verification steps not mentioned in the expected output."
