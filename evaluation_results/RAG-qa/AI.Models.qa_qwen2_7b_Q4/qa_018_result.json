  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant to the question about restricting file types and sizes in the wiki. However, it includes links to general documentation, an extension page, and a user guide on document lifecycle, which do not directly address the specific configuration question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.85 because the actual output incorrectly states that only certain file types like images or PDFs with a maximum size of 10 Megabytes can be uploaded, while the retrieval context specifies that the maximum size of an attachment is set to 100GB by default and 32MB for XWiki versions less than 10.9RC1.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node mentions 'setting limits on the maximum size of an attachment,' and the second node provides 'detailed steps on how to change the maximum upload size,' both of which are directly relevant. The irrelevant nodes, such as the third node discussing 'document properties and the REST API,' are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly matches all the steps and details provided in the expected output. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes steps to change the maximum attachment size and mentions MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details on configuring the `xwiki.properties` file and setting the MIME type allow list."
