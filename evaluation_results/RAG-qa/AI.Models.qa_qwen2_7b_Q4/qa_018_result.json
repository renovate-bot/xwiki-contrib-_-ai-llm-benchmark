  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the output mostly addresses the question about configuring attachment settings, but includes irrelevant links to pages about exports, XWiki syntax, and document lifecycle, which do not directly relate to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly states that the maximum upload size is 10 MB, while the retrieval context specifies a default maximum size of 100GB.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first three nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, discussing topics like 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', 'ODT and PDF export features', and 'various macros and features', none of which relate to configuring attachment upload restrictions in a wiki. The relevant nodes, which discuss 'Size Limit' and 'Mimetype Restriction', and provide 'detailed steps on setting the maximum size of an attachment', are ranked fourth and fifth. This lowers the precision score as the relevant information is not prioritized higher than the irrelevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context provides detailed steps for changing the maximum size of an attachment, similar to sentences in the expected output, it does not mention configuring MIME types, which is a key part of the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring maximum attachment size and MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details on setting MIME types and exact steps for setting size to 10 MB."
