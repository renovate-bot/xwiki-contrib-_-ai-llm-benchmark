  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is largely relevant to the input, effectively addressing the issue with the notification bell. However, it includes repeated source links that do not directly contribute to solving the problem, slightly lowering the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked sixth, mentions editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, which is relevant to enabling notifications. However, the first five nodes are not relevant as they discuss topics like 'custom notification filters', 'alert menu and notification display', 'different ways to receive notifications', 'links and descriptions of notification features', and 'notification email settings and auto-watch modes', none of which address enabling notifications through settings or the 'xwiki.properties' file.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context mentions editing the xwiki.properties file, which aligns with the action of enabling notifications, it does not specify setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, leading to partial alignment with the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention enabling notifications via `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` as in the expected output, and focuses on troubleshooting alert visibility instead."
