  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response is highly relevant to the input, addressing the issue of the unavailable bell icon. However, it includes a source link that does not directly contribute to solving the problem, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the sixth node, mentions 'editing the xwiki.properties file' to enable notifications, is ranked lower than five irrelevant nodes. These irrelevant nodes, such as the first node that 'discusses custom notification filters and their behavior but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings', should be ranked lower. Similarly, the second node 'describes the Alert menu and the display of notifications but does not mention enabling notifications through settings', and the third node 'lists different ways to receive notifications but does not provide information on enabling notifications in the wiki settings', should also be ranked lower. This misordering results in a low precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context mentions editing the xwiki.properties file, it does not specifically mention setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, which is crucial for the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`."
