    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the answer is mostly relevant but repeatedly includes a URL that does not address the specific question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are unrelated to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'token generation and JWT claims', which is unrelated to notifications or user activity settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention notifications about user activity, related settings, 'Erweiterte Filteroptionen', or user notification settings in user profiles.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user activity filters as described in the expected output."
