  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.97 because the response is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about setting upload restrictions, with only a minor irrelevant mention of a general guide link.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which 'provides relevant information about setting the maximum size of an attachment in XWikiPreferences, which is directly related to configuring the maximum upload size', is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes such as the first node, which 'discusses linking to external files and images, but does not address configuring upload restrictions or size limits', and the second node, which 'provides a general overview of XWiki's structure and features, but does not mention configuring attachment upload restrictions or size limits', are ranked higher, reducing the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.56 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the steps for configuring the maximum attachment size as described in sentences 5-9 of the expected output, there is no mention of configuring allowed mimetypes or ensuring only images or PDF files can be uploaded, which are key elements of sentences 1-4.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific instructions on configuring mimetypes in xwiki.properties and setting size to 10MB."
