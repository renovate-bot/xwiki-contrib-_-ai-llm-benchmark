  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the majority of the response is relevant and helpful, but it includes repeated URLs that do not provide the necessary information on how to ensure only images or PDF files of a maximum 10MB can be uploaded.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which provides detailed steps on setting the maximum size of an attachment, is ranked first. Irrelevant nodes, such as those about moving attachments (rank 2), whitelists and blacklists (rank 3), linking to external files (rank 4), and various linking methods (rank 5), are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context nodes provide detailed steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (Step 2, sentences 1-5), they do not mention the restriction to images or PDF files, configuring allowed mimetypes, or editing the `xwiki.properties` file (Step 1, sentences 1-3).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains information about setting the maximum attachment size and mentions mimetype restrictions, but it lacks specific details about configuring the `xwiki.properties` file and the exact mimetype allow list."
