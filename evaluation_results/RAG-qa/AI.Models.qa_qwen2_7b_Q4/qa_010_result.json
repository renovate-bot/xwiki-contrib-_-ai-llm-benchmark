  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer mostly addresses the configuration steps needed in XWiki, but includes irrelevant details such as the URL and example team names that do not directly help with the configuration.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly claims that XWiki uses roles to manage permissions across spaces, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node (rank 5) is ranked lower than four irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node 'explains how spaces and pages are created in XWiki but does not provide information on configuring access rights', and the second node 'discusses the parent/child relationship and the nested pages concept in XWiki, but it does not address access control settings'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights and creating spaces, but lacks specific details on creating groups, setting wiki-wide rights, and inheriting rights for child pages."
