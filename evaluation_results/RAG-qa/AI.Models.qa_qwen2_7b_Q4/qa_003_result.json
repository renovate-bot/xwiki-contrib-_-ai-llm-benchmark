    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node is about getting an RSS feed of notifications, which does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The second node lists various notification settings options but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The third node discusses enabling and disabling the email feature at the platform level, which is not relevant. The fourth node describes different ways to receive notifications in XWiki but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. The fifth node is about overriding default notification templates and installation instructions, which is also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention that users don't receive notifications about their own activity unless explicitly targeted, nor does it mention the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the user's notification settings.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and the ability to enable/disable notifications, but lacks specific details about disabling the filter for one's own activity in the 'Advanced filtering options' section."
