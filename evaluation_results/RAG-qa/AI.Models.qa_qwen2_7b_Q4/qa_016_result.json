  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints' but lacks information on 'user profile field mapping or `xwiki.properties`'. Similarly, the second node focuses on 'container authentication and other methods like LDAP and Active Directory', without addressing 'user profile field customization or `xwiki.properties`'. The third node provides a 'general description of OpenID Connect authentication' but does not cover 'user profile field mapping or `xwiki.properties`'. The fourth node offers 'metadata about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', yet it omits 'user profile field mapping or `xwiki.properties`'. Lastly, the fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', failing to mention 'user profile field mapping or `xwiki.properties`'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output have corresponding information in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about customizing user profile fields using `xwiki.properties` or `oidc.user.mapping`, which are key elements in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions using `xwiki.cfg` instead of `xwiki.properties` for configuration and does not provide the specific mapping example with `oidc.user.mapping` as in the expected output. It includes additional configuration details not directly related to mapping user profile fields."
