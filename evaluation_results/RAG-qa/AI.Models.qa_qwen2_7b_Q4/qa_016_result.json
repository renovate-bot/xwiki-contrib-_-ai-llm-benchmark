  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is highly relevant to the input question, providing useful information on customizing user profile fields in XWiki. However, it includes source links that do not directly address the question, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions the 'xwiki.properties' file for configuring OpenID Connect settings in XWiki, is ranked first. This ensures that the most pertinent information is prioritized over irrelevant nodes discussing topics like container authentication and LDAP, general OpenID Connect guides, the authenticator extension's compatibility, and its dependencies, which do not address user profile field mapping.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the 1st sentence in the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'xwiki.properties' and OpenID Connect. The rest of the sentences lack corresponding information in the retrieval context, such as details on 'oidc.user.mapping', examples of custom property mapping, or instructions on saving and restarting XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions OpenID Connect and xwiki.properties but lacks specific details on customizing user profile fields or using oidc.user.mapping as described in the expected output."
