    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node provides general information about prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address customizing user profile fields or mapping additional fields. Similarly, the second node describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator's general functionality and provides links to various resources, but it does not mention customizing user profile fields or mapping additional fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context nodes mention 'Customization', 'xwiki.properties', and restarting XWiki (supporting sentences 1, 2, and 5), they lack specific examples and details on mapping custom properties and replacing placeholder variables (missing support for sentences 3 and 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuration files and customization but lacks specific details on mapping user profile fields in xwiki.properties and the exact example provided in the expected output."
