  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because while the response provides some relevant information, it includes multiple URLs that are not directly related to authenticating users with access tokens, which reduces its overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are unrelated to the input. For instance, the first node discusses 'properties of a collection object,' the second node talks about 'access to user profile claims,' and the third node explains 'additional rules for right settler policies,' none of which are relevant to authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about authenticating users with access tokens or JWTs, nor does it mention the specific steps and configurations required for the process."
