  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses general OpenID Connect provider configuration and endpoints, but does not mention user profile field mapping or customization. The second node provides information about authentication methods and extensions, but does not address customizing user profile fields or mapping them. The third node is about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, its developer, and installation details, but does not mention user profile field mapping. The fourth node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension and does not discuss user profile field mapping. The fifth node provides configuration guides for specific systems and general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, but does not mention mapping user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because only some parts of the expected output, such as saving 'xwiki.properties' and restarting XWiki, are supported by the nodes in retrieval context, while key details about 'oidc.user.mapping' and specific examples are not directly supported by any node.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information about customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties`."
