  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because while the answer provides some relevant information, it includes multiple URLs that are not directly related to customizing user profile fields from OpenID Connect providers, which detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'various authentication methods for the XWiki RESTful API, including OIDC', which does not provide information on mapping user profile fields. Similarly, the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator for XWiki' but does not address how to map user profile fields. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant node that mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and includes details about OpenID Connect endpoints, which is pertinent to configuring user profile field mappings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the information provided in the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about customizing user profile fields or mapping properties in the xwiki.properties file."
