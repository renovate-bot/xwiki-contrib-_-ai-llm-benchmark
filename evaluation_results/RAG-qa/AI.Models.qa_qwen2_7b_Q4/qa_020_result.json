  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because the response largely addresses the question about configuring access and editing permissions in XWiki, but it includes repeated irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the specific configuration task, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in retrieval context, which discusses 'managing users and groups in XWiki', is ranked fourth. This node should be ranked higher than the first node, which discusses 'XWiki's database support and programming features', the second node, which is about 'notifications and application details in XWiki', the third node, which explains 'the use of nested pages and subwikis', and the fifth node, which covers 'group synchronization and customization', as these are not relevant to configuring access control for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.12 because only sentence 1 in the expected output is supported by node 4 in the retrieval context, which mentions managing users and groups. The rest of the sentences in the expected output have no corresponding information in any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to access control steps or rights management as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output partially follows the expected output with group creation and access control, but lacks specific steps like setting wiki-wide rights and inheriting rights for subpages. It introduces extraneous elements like navigation and group synchronization not present in the expected output."
