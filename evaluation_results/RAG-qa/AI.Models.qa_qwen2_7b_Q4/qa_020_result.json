  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the response addresses the main question about configuring team access in XWiki effectively, but it includes several irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the specific task of configuring team access.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database efficiency and compatibility', which is unrelated to configuring access control for team areas. The second node is about 'notifications and application details', which does not pertain to setting up access controls in XWiki. The third node explains 'nested pages and subwikis', which is not directly relevant to configuring team-specific access rights. The fourth node provides information about 'managing users and groups', but it does not specifically address the configuration of access rights for team areas. The fifth node discusses 'group synchronization and customization', which does not directly relate to setting access controls for team areas in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.12 because only sentence 1 in the expected output is partially supported by node 4 in the retrieval context, which mentions managing users and groups. The rest of the sentences in the expected output are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to access control steps or team-specific rights management as outlined in the expected output."
