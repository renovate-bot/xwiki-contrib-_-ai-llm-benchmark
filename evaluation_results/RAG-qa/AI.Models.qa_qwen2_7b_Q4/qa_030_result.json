  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response largely addresses the question about configuring spaces and roles in XWiki, but the repeated inclusion of source links, which are not directly relevant to the configuration instructions, slightly detracts from the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'a specific XML page structure in XWiki', which does not relate to configuring access rights for teams. The second node talks about 'modifying resources using XML and HTTP methods', which is unrelated to setting access permissions in XWiki. The third node is about 'adding and managing comments in XWiki', which does not pertain to configuring team access to spaces. The fourth node explains 'the emulation of spaces and pages in XWiki', but does not provide information on setting access rights for teams. The fifth node discusses 'migration actions and changes in XWiki', which are not relevant to configuring team access to spaces. Lastly, the sixth node is about 'configuration display scopes in XWiki', which is not directly related to setting up access permissions for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the expected output sentences are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, as they lack any mention of the specific steps, group creation, rights setting, or inheritance described in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, setting rights at wiki or space levels, or inheriting rights for child pages as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual Output mentions similar goals but lacks specific steps like creating groups, setting wiki-level rights, and inheriting rights for child pages as in Expected Output."
