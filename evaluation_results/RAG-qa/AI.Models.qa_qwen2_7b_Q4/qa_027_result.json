  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.97 because the answer is highly relevant and mostly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes a link about creating new users in XWiki, which is not directly related to the group synchronization topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is relevant, is ranked higher than some irrelevant nodes. However, the first, third, fourth, and fifth nodes are irrelevant as they provide general information about prerequisites, installation instructions, developer details, table of contents, and managing users and groups, but do not address the specific process of configuring group synchronization. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 2nd node in the retrieval context mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and provides examples for configuring group synchronization, it lacks specific steps such as opening the file with a text editor, replacing placeholders with actual values, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring group synchronization in the xwiki.properties file and using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks detailed steps and examples provided in the expected output."
