  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the output contains some relevant information about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes several irrelevant statements, such as source links, file names, and unrelated configuration details, which do not directly address the process, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides information about group synchronization and mentions the use of `oidc.groups.mapping` in the xwiki.properties file, is ranked third. However, it is preceded by irrelevant nodes that discuss authentication management and endpoints for OpenID Connect (first node), various authentication methods and extensions (second node), and general information about OpenID Connect authentication (fourth node), which do not address group synchronization or configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the configuration of group synchronization in XWiki, it lacks specific details such as locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, providing examples, and instructions on saving and restarting XWiki, which are crucial for a complete understanding.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping, but lacks details on configuring oidc.groups.claim and oidc.groups.separator as specified in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The output introduces `oidc.userinfoclaims` and `xwiki.cfg` which are incorrect, and lacks details on `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and saving changes in `xwiki.properties`, as described in the expected output."
