  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response addresses the main question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and OpenID Connect, but includes some irrelevant details about accessing the XWiki configuration and administration interface, which are not directly related to the synchronization process.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the third node in the retrieval context is relevant as it 'directly addresses group synchronization by mentioning the use of the `oidc.groups.mapping` property and the need to configure it in the `xwiki.properties` file.' However, the first, second, fourth, and fifth nodes are ranked higher or similarly to the relevant node, despite being irrelevant. The first node discusses 'general OpenID Connect properties and endpoints' without mentioning group synchronization, the second node focuses on 'authentication classes' rather than group synchronization, the fourth node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect and its limitations' without covering group synchronization steps, and the fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' unrelated to group synchronization configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context covers the general aspects of configuring group synchronization and mentions relevant properties like oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, and oidc.groups.mapping, it lacks specific details such as opening the xwiki.properties file with a text editor, providing examples, and instructions on saving and restarting XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using 'oidc.groups.mapping', but lacks details on 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.separator' properties. It also does not cover editing 'xwiki.properties' or restarting XWiki."
