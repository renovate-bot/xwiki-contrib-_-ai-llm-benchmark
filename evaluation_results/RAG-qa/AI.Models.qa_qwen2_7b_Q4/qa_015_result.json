  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user account activation with OpenID Connect. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses the `xwiki.properties` file necessary for enabling automatic user activation with OpenID Connect, is ranked fourth. The first three nodes are irrelevant as they discuss 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration', 'general information about OpenID Connect without mentioning specific properties', and 'metadata about the OpenID Connect Authenticator without addressing automatic user activation'. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the 4th node in the retrieval context supports the instructions to modify 'xwiki.properties' and set 'oidc.enableUser' to 'true', there is no explicit mention in any node about restarting the XWiki instance or ensuring new user accounts are automatically activated upon first login.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about updating the xwiki.properties file or the property oidc.enableUser, which is crucial for the expected answer."
