  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes an irrelevant mention of LDAP authentication, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job maintaining consistency!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which contains the property '# oidc.enableUser=true', is ranked first. This directly addresses enabling user accounts on first login, while all irrelevant nodes discussing domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, prerequisites, installation instructions, container authentication, and LDAP are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context's 1st node supports the mention of the `oidc.enableUser=true` property and its purpose, it lacks details on adding or updating properties, saving the file, restarting XWiki, and the automatic enabling of new user accounts upon first login via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes the exact information needed to enable user accounts on first login by setting 'oidc.enableUser=true' in the xwiki.properties file, matching the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output accurately reflects all critical facts from the expected output, including setting the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true` and restarting XWiki. It misses the comment about uncommenting the line, which is minor."
