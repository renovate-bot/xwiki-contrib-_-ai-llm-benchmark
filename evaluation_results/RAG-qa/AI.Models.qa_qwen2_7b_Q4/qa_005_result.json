  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the response is highly relevant and provides useful information about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it includes a mention of LDAP authentication, which is not relevant to the question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly claims that user creation on login is enabled by setting a property in the xwiki.security.authorisation configuration file, whereas the retrieval context specifies that it should be set in xwiki.cfg.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which mentions the property 'oidc.enableUser=true' directly related to enabling user accounts on first login, is ranked first. All irrelevant nodes discussing topics like 'domain-based authentication and session cookies', 'installation instructions', 'container authentication and LDAP', and 'LDAP configuration' are ranked lower, ensuring precision in retrieval.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context supports the key point about enabling user accounts on first login, it lacks information on updating the `xwiki.properties` file, saving it, restarting XWiki, and ensuring automatic account enablement via OpenID Connect.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes the exact information about the 'oidc.enableUser' property being set to true, which is the key detail in the expected output."
