  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the answer partially addresses the input question about configuring file upload restrictions, but includes several irrelevant URLs that do not directly pertain to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which provides 'relevant information about setting limits on the maximum size of an attachment', is correctly identified as useful. However, the first node, which 'only provides links to various sections of the XWiki documentation and does not directly address the specific steps required', should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node, which 'contains links and information on various document lifecycle features, but it does not provide any specific instructions', and the fourth node, which 'discusses the Directory cleanup and Database Attachment Store but does not provide information about configuring MIME types or setting attachment size limits', are ranked too high.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context's 2nd node provides detailed steps for configuring the maximum attachment size, but it lacks information on ensuring only images or PDF files with a maximum of 10 MB can be uploaded and does not mention configuring MIME types."
