    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and addresses the question about mapping additional user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki properties without any irrelevant information.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring all information aligns perfectly!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides information on the xwiki.properties file and mapping user profile fields, is ranked fifth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node that provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator and the second node that lists dependencies, are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are accurately supported by the 6th node in the retrieval context. Great job!"
