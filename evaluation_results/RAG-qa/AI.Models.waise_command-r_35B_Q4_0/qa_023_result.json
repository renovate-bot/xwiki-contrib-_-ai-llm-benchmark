    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because while the answer provides some relevant information, it includes multiple irrelevant URLs and an image that do not directly address the query about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which directly relates to the user's query about receiving notifications for their own actions, is ranked highest. The irrelevant nodes, which discuss various notification preferences, RSS feeds, and email notifications without addressing the user's specific query, are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output align perfectly with the information in the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
