    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer contains useful information but includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about 'customizing page templates, adding menus, and modifying CSS files,' which is not relevant to notifications. Similarly, the second node discusses 'setting up languages and encoding for XWiki,' which does not relate to enabling notifications. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than any relevant nodes, leading to the low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
