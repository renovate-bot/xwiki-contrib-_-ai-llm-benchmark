    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is completely relevant and addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output makes unsupported claims about the appearance of the bell and the distinction between the Alerts application and the Notifications extension, which are not backed by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For instance, the first node 'provides descriptions and links to various features of the Notifications Application, but it does not address how to enable notifications in the wiki.' The second node 'lists dependencies for the Notifications Application but does not provide any information on enabling notifications.' Additionally, the third node 'describes how to get an RSS feed of notifications, which is not relevant to enabling notifications.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only the first sentence of the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, while the second sentence cannot."
