  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the answer contains several irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own activity. However, it still provides some relevant information related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about 'configuring authorized applications' and does not relate to 'notifications or user activity settings'. Additionally, the second node discusses 'skins, internationalization, accessibility, scalability, and document templates', which are unrelated to the topic of 'user notifications or activity'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about notifications over the user's own activity, 'Erweiterten Filteroptionen', or user profile notification settings."
