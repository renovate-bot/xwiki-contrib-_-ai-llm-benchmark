  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the provided answer includes URLs to XWiki syntax documentation and the Notifications Application extension, which are not directly relevant to the question about disabling notifications. However, the rest of the response likely contained useful information addressing the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "Fantastic job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in retrieval context (rank 5) explaining the 'Auto Watch' feature and how to change its behavior is ranked lower than four irrelevant nodes. These irrelevant nodes (ranks 1-4) discuss various notification-related macros, general descriptions of the Notifications Application, RSS feeds, and customization options, but do not directly address how to disable notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
