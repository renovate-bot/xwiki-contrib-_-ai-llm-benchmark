    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the question well, but the inclusion of an unrelated URL slightly detracts from its precision.",
    "Faithfulness": "Awesome job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions found. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in retrieval contexts are irrelevant. For example, the first node is about 'prerequisites, installation instructions, and general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator', the second node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', and the third node includes 'configuration details for the `xwiki.properties` file' but none address the customization of user profile fields. Therefore, irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the first sentence in the expected output can be attributed to the 1st node in the retrieval context, while the rest of the sentences are not supported by the retrieval context."
