  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because while the response includes useful information about configuring permissions in XWiki, it also contains several irrelevant URLs and closing remarks that do not directly address the configuration query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.42 because the actual output repeatedly references 'espace' and related permissions, which the retrieval context indicates have been removed from the XWiki UI.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context discuss various aspects of XWiki such as space creation, migration, nested pages, configuration display options, and macros, but none of them provide information on setting access controls for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, which focuses on the concept of spaces and pages in XWiki rather than access control steps."
