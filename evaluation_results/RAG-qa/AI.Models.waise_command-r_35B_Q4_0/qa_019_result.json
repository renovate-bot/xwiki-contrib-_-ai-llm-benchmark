    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.62 because the answer includes irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator. However, the rest of the answer likely contains some relevant information related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are unrelated to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various aspects of form validation', the second node contains 'a list of image links and references to different projects', which are not relevant to the topic of denying script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the sentence in the expected output does not match any part of the provided retrieval context. None of the nodes in the retrieval context discuss admin rights or their implications."
