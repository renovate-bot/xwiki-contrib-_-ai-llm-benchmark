    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer contains some useful information related to access rights and security, but includes several irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific task of denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions in the actual output. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'Script Right' and its implications in XWiki but does not address the specific question of denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node describes methods for checking access rights in XWiki but does not directly address the question. The third node talks about the migration of rights when moving pages but is not relevant to denying script rights to a space administrator. The fourth node explains the checkAccess() method for security, which is not related to the specific question. Finally, the fifth node lists various rights and their properties in XWiki but does not address the denial of script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the information in the retrieval context. Great job!"
