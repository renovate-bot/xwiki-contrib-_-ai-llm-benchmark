  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the provided URL does not directly address the query about not receiving notifications, even though the rest of the response is relevant.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the claim states you cannot choose to be notified when a page is deleted, but this is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.87 because the first two nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and correctly ranked higher. However, the third node, which describes the visual representation of notifications and how they are marked as read, should be ranked lower as it is not directly useful for enabling or subscribing to notifications. Similarly, the fourth node explaining email notification settings and grace times should also be ranked lower as it is not directly relevant to enabling notifications or subscribing to specific pages or users. The fifth node is correctly ranked as it mentions the ability to follow a user, which is relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.43 because while the retrieval context provides information on enabling notifications and the alert menu (supporting sentences 1, 2, and 4), it lacks details on subscribing to pages or users, following user profiles, receiving notifications about user events, and the 'network' tab (unsupporting sentences 3, 5, 6, and 7)."
