  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response mostly addresses the user's question about configuring XWiki for automatic account activation with OpenID Connect. However, it incorrectly states that no additional configuration is needed, which is not helpful given the user's issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job keeping everything accurate and faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node mainly provides links to prerequisites and installation instructions, while the second node offers general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific configuration needed. Similarly, the third node describes properties related to endpoints and HTTP headers, and the fourth node lists dependencies, none of which are relevant to automatically activating user accounts on first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the information provided in the nodes in the retrieval context."
