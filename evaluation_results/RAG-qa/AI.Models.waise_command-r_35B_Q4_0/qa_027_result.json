  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and the OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly states that modifying the default behavior of the extension requires modifications to the Java code, while the retrieval context mentions that custom group synchronization can be implemented in a listener, which does not necessarily imply such modifications.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which 'mentions the `oidc.groups.mapping` property and explains the process of group synchronization,' is ranked first, while all irrelevant nodes, which 'describe general functionality and dependencies,' 'focus on endpoints, customization, and troubleshooting,' 'list dependencies and general descriptions,' and 'provide configuration guides for specific systems and general configuration files,' are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while the retrieval context nodes mention key properties like 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping', they do not cover specific steps such as opening the file with a text editor, replacing placeholders with actual values, or restarting XWiki."
