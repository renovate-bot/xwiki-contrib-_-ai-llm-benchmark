    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly relate to the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'getting a notification RSS feed' and the second node 'lists various notification preferences macros,' neither of which address enabling notifications for one's own activity.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
