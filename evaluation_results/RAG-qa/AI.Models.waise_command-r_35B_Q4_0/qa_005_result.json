  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is mostly relevant and addresses the OpenID Connect configuration issue, but it includes a statement about LDAP Authenticator, which is not relevant to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions present. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'container authentication' which does not relate to enabling user accounts upon first login using OpenID Connect, and the second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect Authentication' without mentioning the specific configuration needed.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, ensuring complete alignment."
