  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is mostly relevant and informative about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, the statement 'Great question!' is a generic compliment and does not provide any relevant information, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.70 because the actual output includes instructions to navigate to the 'OIDC Synchronization' tab and specifies formats for OIDC and XWiki groups that are not mentioned or contradict the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first node and the fourth node are relevant and provide specific information about group synchronization and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property. However, the second node (rank 2) and the third node (rank 3) should be ranked lower as they discuss general configuration and dependencies, which are not directly relevant to group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.55 because while the retrieval context provides information on configuring `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.mapping` properties (1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th sentences), it lacks details on locating and opening the `xwiki.properties` file (1st and 2nd sentences), configuring the `oidc.groups.separator` property (6th sentence), and saving and restarting the XWiki instance (10th sentence)."
