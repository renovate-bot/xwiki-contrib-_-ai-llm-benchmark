    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant to configuring file upload restrictions, but it includes links to XWiki syntax and skins documentation, which are not directly related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "Great job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node talks about system filters and unrelated tools, the second node lists image references without addressing file upload configurations, and the remaining nodes continue to list image references without providing relevant information.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the steps or instructions in the expected output are mentioned in the nodes in retrieval context."
