    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the provided URL about XWiki syntax is irrelevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, even though the main topic was addressed.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node 'provides links and descriptions about various notification features but does not directly address how to enable notifications or follow users.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!"
