  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the majority of the response is relevant and addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it is not higher because the inclusion of single words like 'Gruppenkonfiguration' and 'Zuordnung' does not provide useful information and slightly detracts from the overall clarity.",
    "Faithfulness": "Awesome job! The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) that provides information on default group synchronization and mentions the 'oidc.groups.mapping' property is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node primarily provides links to prerequisites and installation instructions, the second node lists dependencies for the extension, and the third node lists endpoints and troubleshooting tips, none of which detail the process of setting up group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.46 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context provides information on configuring `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, it lacks specific instructions on locating, opening, editing, and saving the `xwiki.properties` file, as well as restarting the XWiki instance."
