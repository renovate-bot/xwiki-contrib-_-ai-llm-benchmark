  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the issue about the 'Bell' in the top right corner and the 'Alert Notification' extension without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the 'Notification Application' extension is missing and suggests installing it, while the retrieval context indicates that it is contributed by the Alerts Application.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in retrieval context are irrelevant, with the first node describing 'various aspects of the notification system and its visual elements but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention enabling notifications via the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` or the `xwiki.properties` file itself."
