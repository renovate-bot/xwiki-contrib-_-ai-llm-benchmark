  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.64 because while some parts of the output address the question about mapping user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki, many elements such as URLs, comments, and configuration lines are irrelevant and do not directly answer the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output inaccurately states that the mapping of OpenID Connect claims to XWiki user properties must be specified in the xwiki.cfg file, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is relevant as it lists the available variables for mapping user profile fields, is correctly ranked higher. However, the first node, which is about group synchronization and customization of templates and listeners, and irrelevant nodes discussing in-wiki configuration, general OpenID Connect endpoints, and system configuration guides, are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some nodes in the retrieval context imply customization of user profile fields and provide examples of OIDC user properties, they do not directly mention the specific example of mapping custom properties, the need to replace placeholders, or the requirement to save and restart XWiki."
