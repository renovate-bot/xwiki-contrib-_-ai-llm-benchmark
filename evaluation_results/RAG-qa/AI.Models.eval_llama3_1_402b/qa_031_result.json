  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response mostly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes URLs that do not directly answer the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the first rank provides detailed information on JWT token generation, which is necessary for token-based authentication. Irrelevant nodes discussing document management (second node), cookie protection levels (third node), domain-based authentication (fourth node), and LDAP configuration (fifth node) are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while the retrieval context provides detailed information about JWT tokens and their requirements (supporting sentences 2 and 3), it lacks details on the steps to use the authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and the limitation regarding user creation (unsupportive for sentences 4, 5, and 6).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses document management, cookie protection, and LDAP authentication in XWiki, which are not relevant to user authentication with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output fails to include multiple critical details mentioned in the contexts, such as returning a list of document IDs, 'remember me' cookie functionality, domain-based instance configuration, and LDAP authentication settings. However, it correctly aligns with the context regarding the JWT token and its claims."
