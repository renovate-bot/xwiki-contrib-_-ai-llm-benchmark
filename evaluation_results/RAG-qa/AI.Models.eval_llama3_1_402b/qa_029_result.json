  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer provides useful information but includes several irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the specific question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.62 because the actual output incorrectly suggests that script rights can be refused to a space administrator, whereas the retrieval context specifies that programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page in a single wiki environment or from the main wiki in a multi-wiki environment.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which states 'the wiki administrator cannot have his/her administration rights denied for a page,' is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes discussing 'color themes and access rights' (rank 1) and 'comment, edit, and delete rights' (rank 2) should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly matches the information provided in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses unrelated topics such as color themes, icon fonts, and various rights management, which do not address the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple specific details mentioned in the context, including issues related to Color Themes, icon fonts, Forgot Username/Password functionality, specific rights (Comment, Edit, Delete, Administration, Programming, Register, Create Wikis), blocked attachment mimetypes, and information about implied rights, inheritance, and the additional information table."
