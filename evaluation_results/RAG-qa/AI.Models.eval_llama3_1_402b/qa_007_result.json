  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.81 because the first node is highly relevant, mentioning the `oidc.groups.claim` property and providing an example of its usage. However, the second node, which is about domain-based authentication and session cookies, is irrelevant and should be ranked lower. The third and fourth nodes are correctly ranked as they explain the `oidc.groups.mapping` and `oidc.groups.separator` properties, which are essential for group synchronization. The fifth node, which provides general information about OpenID Connect without addressing group synchronization, should also be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context covers the configuration properties (`oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`), it lacks instructions on locating, opening, editing, and saving the `xwiki.properties` file, as well as restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.60 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookies, and bypassing OpenID Connect, which are not relevant to group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.40 because the actual output aligns well with the context regarding group synchronization and configuration, but it misses key details about domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, and specific system guides, which are crucial aspects of the context."
