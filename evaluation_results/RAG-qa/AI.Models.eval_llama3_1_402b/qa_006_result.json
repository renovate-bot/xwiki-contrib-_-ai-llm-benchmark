  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the customization of user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. However, it includes an irrelevant link about LDAP Authenticator, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the property `oidc.user.mapping` is used to map additional user profile fields, while the retrieval context specifies default values for `oidc.user.mapping` without mentioning additional user profile fields.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the first node is highly relevant, mentioning 'oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}' and 'oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}', which directly relates to mapping additional user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. Irrelevant nodes discussing domain-based authentication, session cookies, group synchronization, custom group mappings, LDAP configurations, and LDAP attribute mappings are correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.83 because most of the expected output is well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, except for the final instruction about saving the xwiki.properties file and restarting XWiki.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, which are irrelevant to customizing or mapping additional user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and no contradictions between the actual output and the context, indicating that the information provided is accurate and relevant."
