  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes a URL about XWiki syntax that does not directly address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides links and descriptions about various notification macros and preferences but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The second node discusses email notifications, including types and frequency, but does not mention enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node explains pre-filtering and post-filtering of notifications but does not provide information on how to enable notifications for one's own actions. The fourth node discusses the resource consumption of notifications and filtering systems but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. The fifth node describes the details of changes in email notifications and various macros for settings but does not mention enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various notification settings and technical details, but none of it addresses how to enable notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks specific details and functionalities mentioned in the context, such as macros, email notifications, pre-filtering and post-filtering modes, scalability, and the level of detail in changes displayed in notifications."
