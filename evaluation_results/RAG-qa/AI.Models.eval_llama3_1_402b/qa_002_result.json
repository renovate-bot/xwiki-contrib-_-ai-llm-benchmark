  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the main response is highly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes links to XWiki Syntax documentation and RSS features, which are not directly related to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses the 'What's New Application' but does not provide information on enabling notifications. The second node lists notification preferences and macros without explaining how to enable notifications. The third node mentions different ways to be notified but lacks details on enabling notifications. The fourth node talks about the Menu and Notifications applications without providing relevant information. The fifth node discusses RSS feeds without explaining how to enable notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports several points about enabling notifications, subscribing to pages or users, and watching a page or user, it does not mention specific details like the `notifications.enabled` setting, the process of watching a user from their profile, or the 'network' tab in the user profile.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context only provides information about various features and preferences in XWiki, but does not address troubleshooting the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple key pieces of information mentioned in the context, such as the 'What's New Application', various notification preferences macros, specific notification methods, and details about the Menu, Notifications, and Invitation applications, as well as available RSS feeds."
