  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'programming rights and their implications', which does not address the ability to deny script rights to a space administrator. Additionally, the second node talks about 'color themes, icon fonts, and user functionalities', which are unrelated to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses various rights and functionalities like Color Themes and Forgot Password functionality, which are not related to denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because all the provided contradictions are actually alignments, indicating that the actual output is consistent with the context."
