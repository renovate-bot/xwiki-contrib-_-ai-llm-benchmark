  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, it includes two URLs that are not directly related to the specific query, which slightly reduces the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'provides links and descriptions of various notification-related macros but does not address how to enable notifications for one's own actions', and the second node 'describes different ways to receive notifications in XWiki but does not mention how to enable notifications for one's own actions'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions that notifications can be sent when an event triggers it (supporting sentence 1), it does not mention the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the user profile (missing support for sentence 2).",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not provide specific information on how to enable notifications for one's own actions, and includes irrelevant details such as 'Share Page by mail' and 'RSS Feeds'.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks numerous specific details and functionalities mentioned in the context, such as various notification macros, methods, and applications, leading to a high level of factual misalignment."
