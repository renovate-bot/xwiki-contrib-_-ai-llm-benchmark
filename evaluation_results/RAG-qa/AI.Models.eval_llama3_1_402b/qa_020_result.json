  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.79 because while the answer provides some relevant information, it includes multiple irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific configuration question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'provides a general introduction to XWiki and its use cases but does not address specific configuration steps for access control', and the second node 'mentions rights management but does not provide the detailed steps required to configure team-specific access control in XWiki'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any node(s) in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about XWiki and wikis but does not address the specific configuration question about team access and editing permissions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical factual information about XWiki's diverse use cases, distinction between first and second generation wikis, relational database usage, user and group management, and a definition of a wiki and its uses."
