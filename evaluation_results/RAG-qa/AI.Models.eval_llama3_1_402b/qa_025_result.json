  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the majority of the response addresses the configuration issue with relevant information, but it includes some general offers for further assistance that do not directly contribute to solving the specific problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.83 because the retrieval context mentions a configuration guide and examples for connecting XWiki to OpenID Connect providers, but it does not specifically mention activating user accounts automatically upon their first login.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the specific configuration needed for automatically activating user accounts upon first login. For example, the first node provides general information about prerequisites and installation instructions, the second node discusses domain-based instance configuration and session cookies, and the third node mentions dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the 5th node in the retrieval context mentions the xwiki.properties file, but none of the nodes provide specific instructions or details that match the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific issue of automatically activating user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key features and details highlighted in the context, such as the automatic synchronization feature, domain-based instance configuration, session cookie settings, specific dependencies, in-wiki configuration, and the possibility of creating custom authentication using a Groovy script."
