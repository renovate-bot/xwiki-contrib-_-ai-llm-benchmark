  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the answer provides relevant information about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes URLs that are not directly related to the question, which slightly detracts from its relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output incorrectly claims that the JWT token must be signed with a private key, while the retrieval context specifies that a JWT token signed with an Ed25519 key is expected.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is relevant, is ranked after the first node, which is not relevant as it 'does not mention anything about user authentication or JWT tokens.' Additionally, the third node, which 'is not directly related to the process of authenticating users with JWT tokens,' is ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while some details about JWT tokens and their claims were supported by the 2nd node in the retrieval context, key details such as 'xwiki.authentication.authclass', 'xwiki.properties', 'authorized applications', and 'creation or update of users' were not mentioned in any node.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses form utilization, configuration, and various applications on XWiki.org, which are irrelevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, such as the reference form, AuthorizationSettler, ConfigurableClass objects, and specific applications like Menu, Notifications, and Invitation. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
