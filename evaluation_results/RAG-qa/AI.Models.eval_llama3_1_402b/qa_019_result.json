  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the claim incorrectly states that script rights can be denied to a section administrator, while the retrieval context specifies that a wiki administrator cannot have their administration rights denied for a page.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and right definitions but does not address the specific question. The second node is about registering and unregistering custom rights, which is not relevant. The fourth node links to additional information about implied rights and inheritance, which does not directly address the question. The fifth node discusses limitations and technical details of the authorization modules, which are also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly supports the expected output. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses authorization configurations and custom rights, but does not address how to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details provided in the context, including customizable components, specific rights, registration/unregistration of custom rights, implied rights, inheritance, limitations of authorization modules, and API/bridge details."
