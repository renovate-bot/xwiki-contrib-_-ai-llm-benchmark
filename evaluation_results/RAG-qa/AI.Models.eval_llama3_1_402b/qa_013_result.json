  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.64 because the provided URL does not directly address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, leading to repeated irrelevant statements. However, the score is not lower because some relevant information might still be present.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node, which lists various notification preferences including custom filters and email preferences, is ranked fifth. The irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing applications and features related to XWiki (first node), AuthorizationSettler and right definitions (second node), blocked attachment mimetypes (third node), and the checkAccess() method for access control (fourth node), should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the sentence about disabling the filter in 'Erweiterten Filteroptionen' is supported by node 6 in the retrieval context, but the sentence about not receiving notifications by default is not found in any of the provided nodes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various applications, authorization settings, and notification preferences in XWiki, none of which address enabling notifications for one's own activity.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks numerous critical details mentioned in the factual alignments, including the Menu application, Notifications application, Invitation application, AuthorizationSettler, blocked attachment mimetypes, checkAccess() method, and various notification preferences macros. There are no contradictions, but the omissions significantly impact the completeness and accuracy of the output."
