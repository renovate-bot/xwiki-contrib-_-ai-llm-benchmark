  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the majority of the response is relevant and helpful for setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, but it includes some extraneous links to unrelated XWiki features.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node provides general information about OpenID Connect and links to various resources, but it does not specifically address the process of setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The second node discusses authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration, which is unrelated to the group synchronization setup process. The third node provides information about XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering, which are not relevant to the group synchronization setup process.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not specifically address the process for setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to include multiple critical pieces of information outlined in the context, such as prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, domain-based instance configuration, endpoints, scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering features, and details about first and second generation wikis. There are no contradictions, but the omissions are significant."
