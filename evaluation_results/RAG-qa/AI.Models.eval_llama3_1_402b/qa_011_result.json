  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the provided URLs do not directly address the specific issue of the missing bell icon in XWiki, although the response is generally relevant to the topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'details of changes displayed in email content and user profile settings,' which is not relevant to enabling notifications. Similarly, the second node explains 'how to get a notification RSS feed and the notifications macro,' which does not help in enabling notifications in the wiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various aspects of the Notifications Application, but none address the specific issue about 'Die Glocke oben rechts ist nicht verf\u00fcgbar, auch nicht wenn die Erweiterung 'Alert Notification' installiert ist.'",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks comprehensive details on multiple aspects such as changes, user profile settings, macros, enabling/disabling extensions, RSS feed notifications, email notification settings, and additional features that can be added to the wiki, leading to a high level of factual misalignment."
