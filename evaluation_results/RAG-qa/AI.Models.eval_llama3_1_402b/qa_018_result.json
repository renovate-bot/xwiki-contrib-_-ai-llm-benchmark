  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the input question, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the specific requirement about file types and size limits.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various API endpoints related to page history, children, and translations,' which does not address file upload restrictions or MIME type configurations. Similarly, the second node is about 'creating or updating page translations' and does not provide any information related to configuring file upload restrictions or MIME types.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the steps or configurations mentioned in the expected output are present in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context describes various API endpoints and HTTP methods for managing wiki pages and attachments, but it does not address how to restrict uploads to only images or PDF files with a maximum size of 10 MB.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical details about HTTP methods, media types, descriptions, status codes, page versioning system, major and minor edits, and history actions for pages, which are essential for alignment with the given contexts."
