    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens. However, the statement about the lack of similar content in the system does not directly answer the question, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because there are no nodes in the retrieval context to evaluate relevance.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, so no sentence in the expected output can be attributed to any node in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because there are no reasons provided for the irrelevancy.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments or contradictions, indicating no hallucinations in the output."
