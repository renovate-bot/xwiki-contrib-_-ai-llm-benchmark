    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the answer provides relevant information about customizing user profile fields in XWiki with OpenID Connect. However, it includes irrelevant statements that do not directly address the input question, which prevents the score from being higher.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because there are no nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, making it impossible to attribute any part of the expected output to it.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the reasons for irrelevancy indicate that the retrieval context does not match the input at all.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no contradictions or factual alignments, indicating no hallucinations."
