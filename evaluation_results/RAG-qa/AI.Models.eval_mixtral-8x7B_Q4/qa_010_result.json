    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the majority of the response is relevant and useful for configuring access in XWiki, but it includes a couple of irrelevant statements such as an example of markdown syntax and a title that doesn't directly contribute to the solution.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because there are no nodes in the retrieval context to evaluate.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, so none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because there are no reasons provided for why the retrieval context is irrelevant to the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments or contradictions, indicating no hallucinations."
