    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because there are no nodes in the retrieval context to evaluate.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, and none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because there are no reasons provided for the irrelevancy of the retrieval context to the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments or contradictions, indicating no hallucinations."
