    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and mostly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect. However, it includes a statement about the inability to find specific information, which slightly detracts from its direct relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because there are no relevant nodes in the retrieval context to address the input question about configuring XWiki for automatic user account activation with OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, so none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any part of it.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because there are no reasons provided for the irrelevancy of the retrieval context to the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments or contradictions, indicating that the actual output is entirely accurate and free of hallucinations."
