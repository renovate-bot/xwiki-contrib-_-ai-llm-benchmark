    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant and provides useful information on configuring XWiki for team access. However, the apology for the lack of directly relevant information slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because there are no relevant nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, so no sentences from the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the reasons for irrelevancy indicate no relevant context was provided.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments or contradictions, indicating no hallucinations."
