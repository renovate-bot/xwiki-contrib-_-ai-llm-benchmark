    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about configuring access rights in XWiki. However, it includes two irrelevant statements that slightly detract from the overall relevancy.",

    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because there are no relevant nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context is empty, so no sentence in the expected output can be attributed to any node in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because there are no reasons provided for why the retrieval context is irrelevant to the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments or contradictions, indicating no hallucinations."
