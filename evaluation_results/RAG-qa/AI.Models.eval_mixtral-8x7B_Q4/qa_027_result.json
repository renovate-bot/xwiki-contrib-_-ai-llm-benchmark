    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because there are no relevant nodes in the retrieval context.",

    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because there are no reasons provided for the irrelevancy of the retrieval context to the input.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments or contradictions, indicating no hallucinations."
