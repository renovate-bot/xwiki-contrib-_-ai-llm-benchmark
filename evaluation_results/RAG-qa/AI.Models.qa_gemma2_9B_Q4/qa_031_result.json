  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements that are source URLs, which do not address the question about authenticating users with access tokens. This significantly lowers the relevancy, but the score is not zero, indicating there might be some relevant content present.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than some irrelevant nodes. The first node is about 'LDAP configuration and does not mention token-based authentication or JWTs', which should be ranked lower than the second node that discusses 'Authorized Applications Configuration', relevant to token-based authentication. Similarly, the third node about 'OpenID Connect and OAuth scopes' should be ranked lower than the fourth node, which provides a description of 'authentication using signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT)', directly relevant to the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.80 because most of the expected output sentences are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, particularly node 4 and node 2. However, there is one sentence that lacks direct support from the retrieval context, which slightly lowers the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about enabling the token authenticator, configuring authorized applications, and using JWTs, which aligns with the expected answer. However, specific details about JWT claims and the use of Ed25519 keys are not explicitly mentioned.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions the use of JWT for authentication but lacks details such as the required claims, Ed25519 signing, and configuration steps mentioned in the expected output."
