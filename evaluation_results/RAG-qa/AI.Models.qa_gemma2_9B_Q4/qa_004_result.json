  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about disabling notifications in XWiki without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'getting a notification RSS feed and enabling/disabling notification types', but it does not address 'how to disable notifications for pages you are not interested in'. The second node talks about 'following a user and default watch settings', which does not provide information on 'how to disable notifications for unwanted pages'. Subsequent nodes similarly fail to address the specific need of disabling notifications for unwanted pages, focusing instead on unrelated topics such as 'filtering notifications for hidden pages', 'enabling/disabling email notifications', 'administrative settings for notifications', and 'overriding default notification templates'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, demonstrating a perfect match. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and user profile settings but lacks details on major modifications automatically adding pages to watchlist and deleting custom filters.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides a general guide to notification settings in XWiki but lacks specific mention of 'Automatic page watching' and 'Custom Filters' as stated in the expected output. It does not address the automatic addition of major modification pages to the watchlist or the deletion of filters created that way."
