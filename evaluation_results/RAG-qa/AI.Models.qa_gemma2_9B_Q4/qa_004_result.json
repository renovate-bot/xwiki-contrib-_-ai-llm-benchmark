    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Watch and custom filters' and is relevant to modifying notification settings, is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes discussing enabling/disabling the notification module (first node), getting a notification RSS feed (second node), 'Clear All' link (fourth node), and choosing default frequency (fifth node) are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context partially supports the expected output, specifically regarding notifications for pages users created or updated (sentence 1), but lacks information on 'Automatic page watching' and deleting notification filters (sentences 3 and 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions settings for notifications and auto-watched mode but lacks details on major modifications, notification filters, and specific user profile settings."
