  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant to the issue of the notification bell not being available, with only a minor irrelevant closing statement that doesn't detract significantly from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, is ranked last (6th node). The earlier nodes are irrelevant as they discuss topics like 'custom notification filters' (1st node), 'alert menu and notification display' (2nd node), 'various ways to receive notifications' (3rd node), 'links to notification settings' (4th node), and 'notification email settings and auto-watch modes' (5th node), none of which address enabling notifications in the wiki settings. This misordering significantly lowers the precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions editing the xwiki.properties file (node 5), it does not specify the 'notifications.enabled' setting or setting it to 'true', which are key details in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the 'xwiki.properties' file or setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true'."
