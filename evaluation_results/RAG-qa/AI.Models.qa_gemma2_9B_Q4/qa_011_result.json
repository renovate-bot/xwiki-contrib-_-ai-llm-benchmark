  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response is highly relevant and addresses the issue with the notification bell icon, but the statement about not having access to the XWiki instance is unnecessary.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'discusses how to get a notification RSS feed and the settings related to notifications but does not address enabling notifications in the wiki settings.' This pattern continues with subsequent nodes, such as the second node which 'talks about overriding default notification templates and installation instructions but does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` or setting it to `true`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`."
