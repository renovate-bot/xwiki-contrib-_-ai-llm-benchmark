  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the response addresses the notification bell issue, but includes transitional and closing remarks that do not directly contribute to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node, which mentions editing the `xwiki.properties` file to enable notifications, is ranked sixth. The first five nodes are irrelevant as they discuss topics like 'custom notification filters', 'alert menu', 'ways to receive notifications', 'different notification settings', and 'customizing notification settings', none of which address enabling notifications in the settings. This lowers the score since the relevant information is not prioritized.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context (node 6) supports the mention of editing the xwiki.properties file, it does not specifically mention setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is crucial for the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`, which is the core information in the expected answer.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not address enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties`, and instead focuses on installation of the Notifications Application, which is not mentioned in the expected output."
