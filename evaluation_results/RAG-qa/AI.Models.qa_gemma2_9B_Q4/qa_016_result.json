    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context provide general information about prerequisites, installation instructions, dependencies, general capabilities, container authentication, endpoints, customization options, and configuration guides, but none address customizing user profile fields or mapping additional fields. For example, the first node discusses 'prerequisites, installation instructions, and dependencies,' which is not relevant to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a perfect match.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions the xwiki.properties file but lacks specific details on customizing user profile fields and the oidc.user.mapping property."
