  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the answer partially addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki, but includes irrelevant information such as sources and documentation links that do not directly help with the customization process.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect provider endpoints', the second node is about 'container authentication', the third node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and configuration guides', the fourth node describes 'the OpenID Connect authenticator extension and its features', and the fifth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect authenticator extension'. None of these contexts mention or address the mapping or customization of user profile fields, which is the focus of the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the information in the nodes in retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information on customizing user profile fields using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties` as described in the expected output."
