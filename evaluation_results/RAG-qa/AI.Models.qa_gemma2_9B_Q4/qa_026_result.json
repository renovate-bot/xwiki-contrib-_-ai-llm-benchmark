  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes repeated irrelevant URLs that do not address the specific question about customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (third node) is ranked lower than multiple irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'various authentication methods for the XWiki RESTful API, including OIDC, but does not address customizing user profile fields or mapping additional fields', and the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator for XWiki, including installation and compatibility details, but does not mention how to map additional user profile fields'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and 'OIDC' in the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the expected output, while key details such as 'oidc.user.mapping' property, examples of mapping properties, replacing 'myxproperty1' and 'myxproperty2', and saving and restarting XWiki are missing.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about customizing user profile fields or mapping properties in the xwiki.properties file."
