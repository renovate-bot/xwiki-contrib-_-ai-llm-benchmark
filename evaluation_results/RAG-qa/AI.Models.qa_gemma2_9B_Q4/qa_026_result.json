  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the response partially addresses the question about customizing and mapping user profile fields in XWiki, but includes irrelevant information about sources that do not directly relate to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'the authentication management class and OpenID Connect provider endpoints', which does not mention user profile field mapping or customization. The second node focuses on 'authentication methods like Container Authentication and Active Directory', without addressing user profile field mapping or customization. The third node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator', but does not mention mapping user profile fields or customizing them. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', which is unrelated to user profile field mapping or customization. The fifth node describes 'configuration guides and limitations for the OpenID Connect Authenticator', but does not address user profile field mapping or customization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context supports the general concept of customizing user profile fields and mapping them using 'oidc.user.mapping' (as seen in the 1st node in retrieval context), it lacks specific examples and details found in sentences 2, 3, and 4 of the expected output, such as the mapping example, replacing property names, and instructions to save and restart XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about customizing user profile fields or mapping them in xwiki.properties, which is the main focus of the expected output."
