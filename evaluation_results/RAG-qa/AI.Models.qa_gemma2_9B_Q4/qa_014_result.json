  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.55 because while the output contains some relevant information about disabling notifications, it is diluted by multiple irrelevant links to documentation pages and extensions that do not directly address the query about disabling notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are about topics such as 'attaching files and managing attachments', 'moving and deleting attachments', 'macros and functionalities', 'administrating wiki features', 'permissions and security modules', and 'XWiki extensions', which are unrelated to the input about disabling notifications. Therefore, irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than relevant ones.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about automatic page following, notification settings, or notification filters as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output suggests adjusting notification settings in general but misses the specific fact about auto-following pages with significant changes and managing custom filters as mentioned in the expected output."
