  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the main content addresses how to disable notifications, but the presence of multiple irrelevant source links prevents a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'attaching files', the second node is about 'moving and deleting attachments', and the third node covers 'macros and their functionalities', none of which relate to 'notification settings or disabling notifications'. Similarly, the fourth node is about 'administrating wiki features', the fifth node lists 'various extensions', and the sixth node mentions 'applications and extensions', all of which do not address the input query about managing notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about automatic page following, notification settings, or notification filters as mentioned in the expected output."
