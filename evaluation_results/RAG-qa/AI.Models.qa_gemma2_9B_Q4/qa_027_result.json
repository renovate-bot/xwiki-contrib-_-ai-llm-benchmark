  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in retrieval context, which provides information on group synchronization using the `oidc.groups.mapping` property and the `xwiki.properties` file, is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, such as the first node which discusses general OpenID Connect provider configuration without addressing group synchronization, and the second node which talks about container authentication without providing details on group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports configuring group synchronization, claims, and mapping, there is no support for specific actions like opening the file with a text editor, replacing placeholders, or saving and restarting XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization using 'oidc.groups.mapping' but lacks details on 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.separator'."
