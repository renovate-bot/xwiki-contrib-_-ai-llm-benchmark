  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the answer mostly addresses the question about configuring access rights in XWiki, but includes URLs that are not directly relevant to the specific task of configuring access rights.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node (rank 5) discussing 'how permissions are set for groups and users at different scopes' is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node 'explains how pages and spaces are created and managed in XWiki' but does not address configuring access rights for teams, and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights and creating spaces but lacks specific details on creating groups for each team and inheriting rights for child pages."
