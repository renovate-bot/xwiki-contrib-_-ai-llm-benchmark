    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because while the answer addresses the main issue, it includes several headings that do not provide actionable information, making parts of the response irrelevant.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node mentioning the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` is ranked third, while irrelevant nodes discussing topics like 'getting a notification RSS feed and various settings' (first node) and 'overriding default notification templates' (second node) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly supported by the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the exact information about enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
