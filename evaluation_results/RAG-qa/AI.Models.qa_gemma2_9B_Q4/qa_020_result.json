  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the response partially addresses the question about configuring access control in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links, which do not contribute to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Everything aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database support and programming features', which do not pertain to configuring access control for teams. The second node is about 'notifications and application details in XWiki', unrelated to team access permissions. The third node explains 'nested pages and subwikis', but not access control. The fourth node mentions 'managing users and groups', yet lacks specifics on team access rights. Lastly, the fifth node covers 'group synchronization and customization', without addressing team access permissions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.12 because only sentence 1 in the expected output can be linked to the 4th node in the retrieval context, which mentions managing users and groups. All other sentences lack corresponding information in the nodes in retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information related to access control steps or rights management mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output aligns well with expected output on creating groups and setting edit rights for team areas. However, it misses details on setting wiki-wide view rights for XWikiAllGroup and inheriting rights for subpages. Also, it introduces additional steps like assigning users to groups and creating pages not explicitly mentioned in the expected output."
