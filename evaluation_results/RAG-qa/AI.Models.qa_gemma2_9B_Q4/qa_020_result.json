  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the output mostly addresses the question about configuring team access and permissions in XWiki, but it includes several irrelevant links to documentation that do not directly relate to the specific configuration task.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'XWiki's database support and programming features', which are unrelated to configuring access control for teams. The second node is about 'notifications and the XWiki Development Team', not about setting access rights for teams. The third node explains 'nested pages and subwikis', which does not directly address team-specific access rights. The fourth node provides a link to 'managing users and groups', but does not directly explain how to set specific access rights for teams. The fifth node discusses 'group synchronization and customization', which is not directly related to configuring access control for teams in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.14 because only sentence 1 in the expected output is supported by node 4 in the retrieval context, which mentions managing users and groups. The rest of the sentences lack direct support from any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to the steps for achieving access control mentioned in the expected output."
