  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and helpful, but it includes an irrelevant link to the XWiki RESTful API documentation, which is not directly related to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly states that adding the claim `xwiki_groups` to the `oidc.userinfoclaims` property enables user info claims, while the retrieval context specifies that it enables default group synchronization.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node providing specific information on configuring group synchronization is ranked fourth, while irrelevant nodes discussing general OpenID Connect details, installation instructions, and customization options are ranked higher (first, second, third, fifth, and sixth).",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.21 because while the retrieval context mentions configuring group synchronization and mapping groups using the xwiki.properties file (supporting sentences 1, 3, and 6), it lacks details on locating and editing the file, specific examples, and instructions on saving and restarting (unsupporting sentences 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and the `oidc.groups.mapping` property but lacks detailed steps and specific properties like `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.separator` found in the expected output."
