  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the question about disabling notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help with the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are correctly ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The first three nodes discuss topics like 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode', 'Create global notification filters', 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', and 'Default Watch Settings', which are directly related to modifying notification settings as expected. The fourth node, which is less relevant as it focuses on 'RSS feeds and general notification settings', is appropriately ranked last. Great job on maintaining perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the supportive reasons show that most sentences in the expected output are related to the 3rd node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'auto watched pages' and user preferences. However, the unsupportive reason indicates that the retrieval context does not cover notifications about changes to one's work, affecting the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, aligning with the expected answer about automatic page following and filter management. However, it lacks explicit mention of modifying auto-watch settings in user profile notification settings."
