  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the question about disabling notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help in resolving the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The first three nodes in the retrieval context are directly related to modifying notification settings, discussing 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode', 'Create global notification filters', 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', and 'Notifications Custom Filters Preferences'. The irrelevant node, ranked fourth, discusses 'RSS feeds and notification macro settings', which are not directly related to the input query about disabling automatic notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because most sentences in the expected output can be linked to the 2nd node in the retrieval context, which covers topics like 'auto watched pages', 'notification applications', and 'custom filters'. However, one sentence lacks direct support from the retrieval context, leading to a less than perfect score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages, custom filters, and notification settings, which align with the expected answer. However, it lacks explicit mention of being notified of changes on your work and modifying the auto-watch setting in user profile notification settings.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention automatic tracking of pages after changes, the ability to modify this setting, or the removal of notification filters as described in the expected output. It focuses on disabling notifications, which contradicts the information in the expected output."
