  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant to configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, with only a minor mention of LDAP authentication that slightly detracts from the focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job on maintaining accuracy!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions '# oidc.enableUser=true', is ranked first. This directly relates to enabling user accounts on first login, as required in the input. The irrelevant nodes, discussing topics like domain-based authentication, general OpenID Connect information, container authentication, and LDAP configuration, are ranked lower, ensuring the most pertinent information is prioritized.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while some sentences in the expected output are supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, others lack direct support from any node, leading to a moderate recall score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes the commented property '# oidc.enableUser=true', matching the expected answer's requirement to uncomment and set it to true, but lacks explicit instructions to save and restart XWiki.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output aligns with the expected output, detailing the modification of the `oidc.enableUser` property and restarting XWiki. However, it does not mention uncommenting the property."
