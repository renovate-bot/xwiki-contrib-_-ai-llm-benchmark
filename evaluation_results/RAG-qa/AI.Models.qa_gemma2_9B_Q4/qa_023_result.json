  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer provides useful information about enabling notifications, but includes irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the query about notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node ranked 2nd mentions 'Filter your own events', which is pertinent to receiving notifications for one's own activity. However, irrelevant nodes ranked 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th discuss topics such as 'notification RSS feed', 'various notification preferences', 'overriding default notification templates', and 'various ways to be notified in XWiki', which do not address the specific issue.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions filtering own events and notification settings but lacks details on default behavior and advanced filtering options."
