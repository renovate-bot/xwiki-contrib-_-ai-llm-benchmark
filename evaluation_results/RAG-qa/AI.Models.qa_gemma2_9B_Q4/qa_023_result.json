  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the output includes irrelevant links that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked first, directly addresses the input question by stating, 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter.' The irrelevant nodes, ranked second to fifth, discuss topics such as RSS feeds, general notification settings, links to various settings, and notification preferences macros, none of which specifically address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence in the expected output is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the second sentence about disabling the filter in 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' is not supported by any node in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms users don't receive notifications for their own actions by default and mentions the option to change this setting, aligning closely with the expected answer. However, it lacks the specific mention of 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es'.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions enabling notifications for own actions but omits the default behavior and filtering options section."
