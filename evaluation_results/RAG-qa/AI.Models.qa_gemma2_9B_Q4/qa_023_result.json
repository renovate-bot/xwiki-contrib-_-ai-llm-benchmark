  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the output includes irrelevant links that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, ranked first, directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications for one's own activity and how to change this setting. The irrelevant nodes, which discuss topics like RSS feeds, lists of links, and general notification preferences, are appropriately ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a perfect match. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the option to change this setting, aligning with the expected output. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section."
