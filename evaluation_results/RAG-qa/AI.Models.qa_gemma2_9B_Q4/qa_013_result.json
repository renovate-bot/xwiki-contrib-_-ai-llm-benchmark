  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.33 because the output includes irrelevant source links that do not directly address the question about activating notifications for one's own activity.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'customization of page templates, internationalization, and other features unrelated to notification settings', the second node is about 'administrating wiki features and does not mention notification settings or user activity', and the third node covers 'various XWiki extensions like Office Importer and Syntax Highlighting, none of which relate to notifications or user activity settings'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about notification settings or user profile options, which are central to the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not contain any of the expected factual information about notification settings or how to modify them, and instead, it provides unrelated source links and an apology, indicating a complete mismatch."
