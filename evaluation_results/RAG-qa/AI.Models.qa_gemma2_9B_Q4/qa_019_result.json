  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.60 because the output includes a source link, which is helpful, but it fails to directly address the specific question of how to deny script rights to a range administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'form validation and JavaScript patterns', which are unrelated to script rights in XWiki. The second node is about 'templates and page creation in XWiki', not addressing script rights or administrative permissions. The third node involves 'a custom right check and configuration in XWiki', but it does not specifically address denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention anything about 'Rechte' or 'Admin-Recht', making it impossible to attribute the expected output to the context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to the admin rights or their implications in XWiki, as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not address the specific information in the expected output about admin rights not being deniable in XWiki. It instead provides unrelated sources and suggests consulting documentation, missing the key factual point."
