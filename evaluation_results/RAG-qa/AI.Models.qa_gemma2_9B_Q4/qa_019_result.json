    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.17 because the provided URLs and statements are irrelevant to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. The response did not address the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. For instance, the first node contains 'image links and references to various projects', the second node includes 'technical details about Kerberos authentication and LDAP configuration', and the third node discusses 'mail templates for resetting passwords and finding usernames'. None of these contexts address the question about denying script rights to a domain administrator in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence does not match any part of the provided retrieval context, which discusses images, LDAP authentication, and form utilization on XWiki, but does not mention admin rights or their implications.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about the admin rights or their implications in XWiki."
