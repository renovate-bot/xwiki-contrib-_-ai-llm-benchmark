  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant and effectively addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki. However, it includes a source link that is not directly relevant to the specific customization query, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and provides an example of mapping using 'oidc.user.mapping', is ranked first. This directly addresses the input query about mapping additional user profile fields from OpenID Connect to XWiki. Great job on getting it spot on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context supports the concept of mapping custom properties using `oidc.user.mapping` as mentioned in sentence 2 and 3 of the expected output, it lacks information on replacing placeholders with actual property names and the need to save and restart XWiki as stated in sentences 4 and 5.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all the information found in the expected answer, including the ability to customize user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, with examples provided."
