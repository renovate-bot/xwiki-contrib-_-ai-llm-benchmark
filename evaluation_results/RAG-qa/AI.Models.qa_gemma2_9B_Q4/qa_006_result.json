  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer partially addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki, but includes irrelevant statements like a source link and a reference to documentation that do not directly answer the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and provides an example of mapping, is ranked first. This directly relates to customizing user profile fields, while the irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing 'scopes and response types for OpenID Connect' (second node), 'endpoints and HTTP headers for OpenID Connect' (third node), 'group synchronization and customization templates' (fourth node), and 'in-wiki configuration and multiple configurations through cookies' (fifth node), are ranked lower. Great job on getting the order spot on!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the first node in the retrieval context supports the customization of user profile fields and provides examples of mapping them, it lacks details on replacing placeholders with actual property names and the need to save and restart XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes the information about customizing user profile fields using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in the `xwiki.properties` file, which matches the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Both outputs describe using the `oidc.user.mapping` property in `xwiki.properties` for customizing user profile fields from OpenID Connect. However, the actual output uses a different example and omits the restart step mentioned in the expected output."
