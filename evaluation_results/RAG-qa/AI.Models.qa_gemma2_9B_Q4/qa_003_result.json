    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed and general notification settings but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. The second node lists options for customizing notification emails and creating global notification filters but does not mention enabling notifications for one's own actions. The third node is about enabling and disabling the email feature and customizing live email notifications grace time, which is not relevant to enabling notifications for one's own actions. The fourth node lists different ways to be notified in XWiki, such as through the Notifications Application, Share Page by mail, RSS Feeds, and Mentions, but does not address enabling notifications for one's own actions. The fifth node discusses overriding default notification templates and installation instructions for extensions, which is not relevant to enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention that users don't receive notifications about their own activity unless explicitly targeted, nor does it mention the ability to disable this filter in the 'Advanced filtering options' section of the user's notification settings.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and the ability to enable/disable notifications, but does not specify disabling the filter for one's own activity or the 'Advanced filtering options' section."
