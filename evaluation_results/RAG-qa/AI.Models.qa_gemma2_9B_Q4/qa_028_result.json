    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes a URL that does not directly address the specific question about limiting file uploads to images or PDFs of a maximum size of 10 MB.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring file upload restrictions. For example, the first node discusses 'various macros and their functionalities,' the second node explains 'how to customize the PDF cover,' and the third node describes 'how to create a new page,' none of which address the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about configuring MIME types or setting attachment size limits."
