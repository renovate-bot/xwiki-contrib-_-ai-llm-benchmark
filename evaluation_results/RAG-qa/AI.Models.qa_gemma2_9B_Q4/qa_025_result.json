  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the main question about configuring OpenID Connect for automatic user activation in XWiki. However, it includes a minor irrelevant statement about the XWiki RESTful API, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context provide general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator or related topics, but none address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, including its developer, type, and license, but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context mentions 'automatic synchronization' and 'OpenID Connect Authenticator Extension,' which aligns with activating user accounts on first login, there is no specific mention of adding or updating properties, the property `oidc.enableUser`, or saving the file and restarting the instance.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or setting the `oidc.enableUser` property."
