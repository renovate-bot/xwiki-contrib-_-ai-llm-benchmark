  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information on how to deny script rights to a space administrator. However, it includes links to unrelated documentation that do not directly address the question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses methods for checking access rights and does not address the specific question of denying script rights to a space administrator. Similarly, the second node talks about the usage of the checkAccess() method without providing information on denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about rights implied by admin rights or their denial, focusing instead on access checks and methods like checkAccess() and hasAccess().",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention that admin rights cannot be denied, which is the main point of the expected output."
