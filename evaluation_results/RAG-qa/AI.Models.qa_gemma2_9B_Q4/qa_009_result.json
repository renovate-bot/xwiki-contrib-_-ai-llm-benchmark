  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the output includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not address the question about denying script rights, which detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. The first node discusses programming rights and script execution but does not address denying rights to a space administrator. The second node lists various rights and their properties but does not mention the inability to deny rights to a space administrator. The third node explains the script right and its default settings but does not relate to denying rights to a space administrator. The fourth node provides code snippets related to access checks but does not address the specific issue of denying rights to a space administrator. The fifth node discusses converting rights during page migration but does not mention denying rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The expected answer states that rights implied by admin cannot be denied, which aligns with the retrieval context indicating that admin rights are not deniable."
