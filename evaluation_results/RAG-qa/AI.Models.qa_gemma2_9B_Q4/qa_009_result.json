  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the main content effectively addresses how to deny script rights to a space administrator, but the inclusion of multiple source links that do not directly answer the question slightly detracts from the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Everything aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses programming rights and their implications, but does not address the denial of script rights to a space administrator. The second node provides a list of rights and their properties, but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator. The third node explains the script right and its default settings, but does not mention the inability to deny it to a space administrator. The fourth node is about checking access rights programmatically, which does not relate to denying script rights to a space administrator. The fifth node discusses converting rights during page migration, which is unrelated to denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The expected answer is fully supported by the retrieval context, which states that admin rights imply other rights and cannot be denied, aligning with the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides a method to deny script rights to a space administrator, contradicting the expected output that states rights implied by admin cannot be denied."
