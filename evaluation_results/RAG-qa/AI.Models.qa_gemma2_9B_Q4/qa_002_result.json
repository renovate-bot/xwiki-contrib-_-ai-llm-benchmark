    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the first node in the retrieval context is relevant, explaining how to follow a user to receive notifications, and the fourth node is also relevant, providing an overview of ways to receive notifications in XWiki. However, the second node, discussing filters and settings without addressing enabling notifications, and the third node, focusing on RSS feeds and settings, are both irrelevant and ranked higher than the fourth relevant node. Additionally, the fifth node, which is about the 'What's New' application, is not directly related to enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because half of the sentences in the expected output are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as the details on using the 'alert' menu and following a user. However, key setup instructions like enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and subscribing to pages are missing from the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on following users and watching pages, but lacks details on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching entire wikis.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions enabling notification types and checking filters, which partially aligns with enabling notifications in the expected output. However, it lacks details about setting notifications in `xwiki.properties`, watching pages or users, and using the 'alert' menu. No mention of the 'network' tab in user profiles is made."
