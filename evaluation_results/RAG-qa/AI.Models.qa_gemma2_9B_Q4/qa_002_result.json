  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.81 because most relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. The first node provides guidance on setting up notifications correctly, and the third and fourth nodes discuss enabling notification types and different ways to receive notifications, which are all relevant to the input. However, the second node, ranked second, discusses filters and settings related to hidden pages and personal activity, which does not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications, slightly lowering the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while the retrieval context covers how to watch pages, locations, and users (as seen in the 1st node), it does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or explicitly subscribing to pages or users.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions following users and watching locations for notifications, but lacks details on enabling notifications via xwiki.properties and watching pages or entire wikis."
