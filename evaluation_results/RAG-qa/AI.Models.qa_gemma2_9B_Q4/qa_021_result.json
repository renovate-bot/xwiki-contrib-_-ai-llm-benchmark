    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job staying faithful to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses how to get a notification RSS feed and the settings for notifications, but it does not address how to enable notifications in the wiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention anything about ensuring notifications are activated in the wiki or provide any information about defining the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about setting the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` to `true`."
