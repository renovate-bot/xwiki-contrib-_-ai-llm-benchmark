  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the issue with the notification bell icon, but includes irrelevant information about XWiki syntax and a general offer for further assistance, which do not directly resolve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior', which does not relate to enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The second node lists 'various notification-related features and settings' but fails to address enabling notifications through `xwiki.properties`. The third node describes 'different notification preferences and macros', without mentioning enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The fourth node provides a 'general description of the notifications application and its interface', again not addressing enabling notifications in the wiki settings. Lastly, the fifth node discusses 'RSS feeds and notification settings' but does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the first sentence is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, which discusses notification filters, but the second sentence is unsupported as there is no mention of setting the `notifications.enabled` property in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, which are key details in the expected output."
