  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the main content addresses how to refuse script rights to a space administrator effectively, but the inclusion of repeated source links that do not directly answer the question slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page,' is ranked second. However, the first node is irrelevant as it is about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki,' which does not pertain to script rights or administrative permissions. Additionally, other irrelevant nodes, such as the third node discussing various rights like VIEW, EDIT, COMMENT without addressing script rights, are ranked higher than they should be.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context, demonstrating a clear understanding of the topic. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that admin rights imply other rights and are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that admin rights cannot be refused, as mentioned in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output contradicts the expected output by suggesting a method to refuse rights, whereas the expected output states it is not supported."
