  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the main content effectively addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator. However, the inclusion of an irrelevant source link repeated multiple times slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the first node in the retrieval context is about 'language preferences and translations in XWiki', which is unrelated to the question about script rights, yet it is ranked higher than relevant nodes. Additionally, the fourth node discusses 'checking access rights programmatically', and the fifth node is about 'executing code with specific user rights', both of which do not directly address the question and should be ranked lower than the second and third nodes that are relevant to script rights and permissions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every part of the expected output is perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that certain rights like ADMIN are not deniable, but it does not explicitly state that administrator rights cannot be refused as mentioned in the expected output."
