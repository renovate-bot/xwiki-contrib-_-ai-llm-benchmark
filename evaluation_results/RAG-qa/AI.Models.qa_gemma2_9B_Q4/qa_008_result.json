  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about configuring attachment settings, but it includes some irrelevant details about XWiki syntax and access to configuration files that do not directly address the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which mentions that 'As an administrator you can set limits on the maximum size of an attachment,' is ranked first, while all irrelevant nodes are ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.45 because while the retrieval context provides detailed steps for setting the maximum attachment size (Step 2), it lacks information on configuring allowed mimetypes and editing the `xwiki.properties` file (Step 1).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains detailed steps for setting maximum attachment size and mentions mimetype restrictions, but lacks specific instructions for configuring the `xwiki.properties` file."
