    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which provides information on setting the maximum size of an attachment in XWikiPreferences, is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing linking to external files and images without addressing mimetype restrictions or maximum upload size configurations, and the second node explaining the structure of XWiki pages without relating to configuring attachment settings, are ranked higher. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (Sentences 5-10) are well-supported by the 3rd node in the retrieval context, the instructions for configuring allowed mimetypes (Sentences 1-4) lack direct support from any specific node.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specifics on configuring xwiki.properties for mimetypes and setting size to 10MB."
