    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the output contains irrelevant information, such as a link to XWiki skins documentation and a request for the user's question, which do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, containing 'image links and references that are not related to notifications or their settings' (first node), 'do not provide any information about notification settings or how to enable them' (second node), and 'include image links and references that are unrelated to the topic of notifications or their configuration' (third node).",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains no relevant information about enabling notifications or following pages and users as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not contain any relevant factual statements or information from the expected output. It is entirely missing the instructions on enabling notifications and following pages or users."
