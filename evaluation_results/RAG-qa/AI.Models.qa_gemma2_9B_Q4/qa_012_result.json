    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.38 because the provided URL is not directly related to notifications in XWiki, which is the main concern in the input.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'various XWiki applications like Meeting Application, Forum Application, and Ideas Application,' which are not relevant to enabling notifications. Similarly, the second node talks about 'access rights and executing tasks with specific user rights,' which is unrelated to enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about enabling notifications or following pages and users."
