  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a URL that does not directly address how to configure permissions in XWiki, which slightly detracts from its overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.20 because the actual output repeatedly mentions controlling permissions and creating spaces, while the retrieval context clearly states that the notion of space has been removed from the UI.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to configuring access rights for team spaces. For example, the first node explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki but does not provide any information on how to set access rights for teams. The second node describes various macros and their uses in XWiki, which is unrelated to configuring access rights for team spaces. Additionally, the third node discusses the parent/child relationship and nested spaces in XWiki, but it does not provide any steps or guidelines on setting access rights for different teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the steps or details in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, defining rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages."
