  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the response largely addresses the question about configuring team spaces in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly assist with the configuration process.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'XML metadata about a page', which is unrelated to configuring access rights in XWiki. The second node talks about 'sending representations to modify resources', which does not pertain to setting access permissions for spaces. The third node focuses on 'editing and managing comments', which is not relevant to configuring team access. The fourth node explains 'the creation of spaces and sub-pages', but does not address access rights or permissions. The fifth node provides 'a list of actions related to page migration and renaming', which does not relate to access control settings. Finally, the sixth node discusses 'configuration display scopes', which does not provide information on setting access rights for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because while there are connections between defining rights at the wiki and space levels to nodes in the retrieval context, key elements such as creating groups for teams and inheriting rights for child pages are not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about creating groups, setting rights at the wiki or space level, or inheriting rights for child pages, which are key elements in the expected output."
