  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the output provides some relevant information about configuring spaces and permissions in XWiki, but it includes multiple source links and a note about user groups that do not directly address the specific configuration question, reducing the overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node is about 'a specific page in XWiki and does not provide information on setting access rights or managing spaces for teams.' The second node discusses 'modifying resources using XML and HTTP methods, which is not relevant to configuring team access in XWiki.' The third node is about 'managing comments and attachments, which is unrelated to setting access rights for spaces in XWiki.' The fourth node explains 'how spaces and sub-pages work in XWiki, but does not provide guidance on configuring access rights for teams.' The fifth node is about 'migration actions and does not address configuring access rights for teams in XWiki.' Finally, the sixth node discusses 'configuration display options in XWiki, which is not related to setting access rights for team spaces.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to creating groups, setting rights, or managing access in XWiki, which are key elements in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output creates spaces for teams but misses creating groups for each team and setting wiki-level permissions. It grants read and write permissions instead of specifying modify rights only for team spaces. It lacks mention of inheriting rights for child pages."
