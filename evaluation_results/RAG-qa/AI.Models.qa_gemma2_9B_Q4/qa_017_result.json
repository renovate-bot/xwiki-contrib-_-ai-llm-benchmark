  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and the OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific process of group synchronization configuration. The second node describes the OpenID Connect Authenticator and its compatibility but does not provide information on configuring group synchronization. The third node mentions container authentication and other methods but lacks details on setting up group synchronization. The fourth node references group synchronization but does not provide the detailed steps or configuration settings required. The fifth node lists various configuration guides and files but does not provide the specific steps or properties needed to configure group synchronization.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output aligns perfectly with the nodes in the retrieval context, providing a comprehensive and accurate guide for setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization but lacks detailed steps and specific properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` found in the expected output."
