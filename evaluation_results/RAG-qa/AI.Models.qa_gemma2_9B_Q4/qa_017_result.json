  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response is highly relevant to the input question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, it includes source links that do not directly address the specific setup process, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints without mentioning group synchronization or configuration related to 'oidc.groups.claim' or 'oidc.groups.mapping'. The second node provides information about container authentication and Active Directory, which is unrelated to the group synchronization process between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The third node mentions automatic synchronization with an OpenID Connect provider but lacks specific details on configuring group synchronization, such as setting properties in 'xwiki.properties'. The fourth node lists dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension but does not provide any information about configuring group synchronization. Finally, the fifth node describes the OpenID Connect authenticator's general capabilities and compatibility but does not address group synchronization setup or configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, indicating a complete lack of relevant information.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about configuring group synchronization in the xwiki.properties file, which is the main focus of the expected output."
