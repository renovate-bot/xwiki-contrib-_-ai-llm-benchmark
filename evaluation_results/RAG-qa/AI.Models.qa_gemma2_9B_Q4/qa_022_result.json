  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help resolve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are perfectly ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'Enable and disable the extension' and 'Enabling notifications for all users by default', which directly relates to ensuring notifications are activated. The second node includes 'Follow a user', aligning with the need to follow users for notifications. Irrelevant nodes, such as the third node discussing 'Get a notification RSS feed' and 'Notifications Macro', and the fourth node listing various notification preferences macros, are correctly ranked lower as they do not directly address enabling notifications or following users. Great job on the perfect ranking!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the nodes in retrieval context support enabling notifications and following pages or users (sentences 1, 3, and 4), they do not mention specific details like 'xwiki.properties', the 'alerte' menu, receiving all user-triggered notifications, or the 'r\u00e9seau' tab (sentences 2, 5, 6, and 7).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "Retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties' and specifics on following pages or users.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks instructions on enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties`, following pages or users, and checking the 'r\u00e9seau' tab in user profiles. It asks questions instead of providing the expected procedural information."
