    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help solve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. Great job on the perfect ranking!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because most of the expected output is supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as enabling notifications and following users or pages. However, specific details like setting 'notifications.enabled' and the 'network' tab in the user profile are missing from the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting 'notifications.enabled' to true, following specific pages, and using the alert menu."
