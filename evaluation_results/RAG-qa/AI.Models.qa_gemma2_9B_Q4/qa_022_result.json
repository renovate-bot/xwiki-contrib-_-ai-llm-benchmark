  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications, but the inclusion of a URL that does not directly address this issue slightly lowers the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Watched Entities' and 'Follow a user', is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'getting a notification RSS feed and settings' and the second node about 'overriding default notification templates and installation instructions', should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks detailed steps on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` and specifics on how to follow pages or users."
