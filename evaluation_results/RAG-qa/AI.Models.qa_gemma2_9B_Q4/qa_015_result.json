  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a statement about the inability to provide a direct answer, which does not directly address the input query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator but does not address the specific configuration needed. The second node describes the purpose of the authenticator but lacks details on automatic user activation. The third node lists various configuration guides but omits the specific property `oidc.enableUser`. The fourth node mentions the `xwiki.properties` file but does not specify the necessary property for automatic user activation.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the 2nd node in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
