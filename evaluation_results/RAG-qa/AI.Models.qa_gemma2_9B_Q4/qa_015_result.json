  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant and addresses the main question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect. However, it includes a source link that doesn't directly solve the configuration issue, slightly affecting the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which is unrelated to the automatic activation of user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect. The second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and configuration guides,' but does not address the specific configuration needed for automatic activation. The third node contains 'metadata about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' which does not relate to the configuration of automatic user activation. Lastly, the fourth node provides information about 'various OpenID Connect endpoints and configurations,' but does not mention the specific property 'oidc.enableUser' or its configuration in 'xwiki.properties.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because the retrieval context only partially supports the expected output by mentioning modifying properties in the xwiki.properties file (node 4), but it lacks specific details about automatically activating user accounts with OpenID Connect and the exact property changes required.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information on adjusting `xwiki.properties` to enable automatic user account activation with OpenID Connect.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks the key instruction to uncomment and set `oidc.enableUser=true` in `xwiki.properties`, and instead adds unrelated configuration details. It omits the step to restart XWiki and the assurance that accounts will be activated automatically."
