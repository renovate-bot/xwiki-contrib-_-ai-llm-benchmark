  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes repetitive and irrelevant URLs that do not address the issue of not receiving notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node is about 'defining blocked attachment mimetypes,' which does not address notifications or their settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context provide information related to enabling notifications, following pages or users, or viewing notifications in the user profile.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses configuration, security settings, permissions, and storage, none of which relate to the input 'Ich erhalte keine Benachrichtigungen.'",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple critical details that are present in the factual alignments, indicating a high degree of missing or incorrect information."
