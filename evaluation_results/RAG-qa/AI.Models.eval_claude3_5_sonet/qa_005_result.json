  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant and there are no irrelevant statements in the actual output. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node that contains the specific property 'oidc.enableUser=true' in the 'xwiki.properties' file, which directly addresses the configuration needed to enable user accounts on first login, is ranked fifth. Irrelevant nodes discussing 'domain-based instances and session cookie configuration' (first node), 'general information about OpenID Connect and its limitations' (second node), 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect extension' (third node), and 'logging configuration and short URLs' (fourth node) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because while the 6th node in the retrieval context mentions `# oidc.enableUser=true`, it lacks specific instructions about adding or updating the property in the `xwiki.properties` file, uncommenting and setting the property to `true`, saving the file, and restarting the XWiki instance.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but it does not address how to configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output misses several critical pieces of information, such as updating the session cookie configuration, installation instructions, dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator, and logging configuration. These omissions indicate a high level of hallucination, as the output does not fully align with the necessary factual details."
