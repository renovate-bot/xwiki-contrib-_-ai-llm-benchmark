  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.81 because the answer mostly addresses the question about configuring access rights in XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not directly help with the specific configuration issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.94 because the actual output incorrectly states that 'espaces' are pages since version 7.2, while the retrieval context indicates that the notion of space has been removed from the XWiki UI without specifying a version.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node 'discusses the scope of configuration display in XWiki but does not address access control or team-specific permissions', and the second node 'explains the concept of spaces and sub-pages in XWiki but does not provide information on setting access rights or permissions for teams'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention any specific steps, guidelines, or information related to achieving access control in XWiki as outlined in the expected output.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context does not address the specific requirement of configuring visibility and edit permissions for team spaces in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several key details described in the context, including configuration options, creation of spaces and sub-pages, multi-tenancy and clustering capabilities, creation of children pages, page access rights, panels, and database support. There are no contradictions, but the omissions indicate a high level of hallucination."
