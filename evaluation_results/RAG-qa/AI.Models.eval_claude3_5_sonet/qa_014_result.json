  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the answer contains several irrelevant links that do not address the question about disabling notifications. However, the score is not lower because the core response still provides some useful information related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'blocked attachment mimetypes,' which is unrelated to disabling notifications. Similarly, the second node talks about 'setting the default language for a wiki page,' which does not pertain to notification settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like blocked attachment mimetypes, default language settings, directory cleanup, and programming rights, none of which relate to the input about disabling notifications.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple critical details that should be included, such as configuring blocked attachment mimetypes, setting the default language in a multilingual wiki, directory cleanup, database attachment store settings, editing translations, and various rights in XWiki. There are no contradictions, but the omissions lead to a high hallucination score."
