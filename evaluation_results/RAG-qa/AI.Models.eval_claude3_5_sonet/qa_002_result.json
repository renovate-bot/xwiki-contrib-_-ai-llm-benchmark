  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant to the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki, but it includes unrelated information about XWiki syntax, general features, and RSS features.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node explaining ways to receive notifications in XWiki is ranked third, while irrelevant nodes mentioning the What's New Application (first node) and various notification preferences macros (second node) are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because only parts of the expected output about receiving notifications and the alert bell were supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, while key details about enabling notifications, subscribing to pages or users, and following users were missing.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.60 because the context only provides information about the 'What's New Application' in XWiki and includes irrelevant parts such as 'Menu application', 'Invitation', and 'Other features can be added to your wiki by installing extensions not listed above', which do not address the issue of not receiving notifications in XWiki.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.00 because there are no factual alignments and multiple contradictions indicating that the actual output does not align with the provided contexts."
