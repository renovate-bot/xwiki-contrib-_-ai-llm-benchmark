  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is completely relevant and addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node provides general information about OpenID Connect authentication and configuration guides but does not mention the specific property `oidc.enableUser` or the `xwiki.properties` file. The second node discusses domain-based instance authentication and session cookie configuration, which is unrelated to automatically activating user accounts on first login. The third node talks about bypassing OpenID Connect and disabling it using the `oidc.skipped` property, which is not relevant to the automatic activation of user accounts.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the reference to adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file (sentence 1) can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context, while the rest of the instructions and details are not supported by the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context provides general information about OpenID Connect and various configuration guides, but it does not specifically address how to configure XWiki to automatically activate user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to include multiple critical details from the context, such as specific URLs, detailed steps, domain-based instance configuration, session cookie settings, dependencies, in-wiki configuration, and custom authentication using a Groovy script."
