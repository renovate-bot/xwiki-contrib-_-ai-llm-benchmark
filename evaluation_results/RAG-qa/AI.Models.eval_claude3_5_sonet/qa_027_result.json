  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes links to pages about scalability, Office Importer, and database support, which are not relevant to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining accuracy and alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which mentions that 'XWiki can authenticate with an OpenID Connect provider and perform automatic synchronization,' is ranked fourth. The irrelevant nodes discussing 'XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, and clustering' (first node), 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration' (second node), 'configuring an OpenOffice server with XWiki' (third node), and 'database support and programming features of XWiki' (fifth node) should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like multi-tenancy, clustering, and scalability of XWiki, which are not related to configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to mention several key details provided in the context, including XWiki's scalability, multi-tenancy, clustering features, domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, OpenOffice server configuration, OpenID Connect prerequisites and installation, and the use of relational databases with Hibernate support. There are no contradictions, but the omissions result in a high hallucination score."
