  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider, but it includes links about scalability, performance, and database support features in XWiki, which are irrelevant to the specific question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are unrelated to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookies,' which is not relevant to customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider. Similarly, the second node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator,' which does not address the customization of user profile fields. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context provide information related to customizing user profile fields in the `xwiki.properties` file, using the `oidc.user.mapping` property, or the steps to apply these changes.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, but does not address how to customize or map additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks critical information that is expected based on the contexts, indicating a high level of hallucination."
