  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the answer contains multiple irrelevant links that do not address the specific question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. However, the score is not lower because the core response still provides some relevant information regarding the customization process.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'authentication with a domain-based instance and session cookie configuration,' which is not related to mapping user profile fields from OpenID Connect. The second node talks about 'XWiki's use of a relational database and its programming features,' which also does not relate to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any information in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses topics like domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, and XWiki's scalability, which are irrelevant to the input question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output provides related documentation links but fails to address the specific details mentioned in the context, leading to incomplete and potentially misleading information."
