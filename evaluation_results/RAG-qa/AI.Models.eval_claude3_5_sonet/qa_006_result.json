  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the majority of the response is relevant and addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. However, the inclusion of unrelated URLs slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "Failed to measure after 3 attempts: Evaluation LLM outputted an invalid JSON. Please use a better evaluation model.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the first rank mentions that 'It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user' and provides an example of how to map custom properties using the `oidc.user.mapping` property. The irrelevant nodes in the subsequent ranks discuss topics such as domain-based authentication, group synchronization, and LDAP configurations, which are not related to customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because the retrieval context supports the customization of user profile fields and provides examples of mapping, but it lacks details on replacing property names and the steps to save and restart XWiki.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.20 because the context discusses domain-based authentication, session cookie configuration, and bypassing OpenID Connect, which are not relevant to customizing user profile fields or mapping additional user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output fails to mention several key aspects such as domain-based instance authentication, session cookie configuration, group synchronization, custom group synchronization, allowed or forbidden groups for authentication, and LDAP authentication or LDAP group configurations, which are the focus of the provided contexts. The only alignment is with the context mentioning the oidc.user.mapping property."
