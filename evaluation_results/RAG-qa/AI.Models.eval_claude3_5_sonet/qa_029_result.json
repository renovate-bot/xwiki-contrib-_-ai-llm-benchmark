  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator in XWiki. However, it includes a URL and a polite acknowledgment in French that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly claims that individual rights cannot be revoked for a space administrator, while the retrieval context indicates that administration rights are granted at the page or wiki level and implies the possibility of other permissions.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (rank 3) is ranked lower than multiple irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'Color Themes, access rights, and other unrelated issues,' and the second node explains 'the comment right and its implications,' both of which should be ranked lower than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses Color Themes, icon fonts, and forgot username/password functionality, which are irrelevant to the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to address multiple specific issues and details mentioned in the context, such as accessibility features, specific user rights, and configuration settings, leading to a high level of factual misalignment."
