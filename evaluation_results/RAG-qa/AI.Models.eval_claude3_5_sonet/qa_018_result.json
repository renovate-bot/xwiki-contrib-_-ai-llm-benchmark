  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the main content is highly relevant and addresses the input question well, but it includes URLs that are not pertinent to configuring file upload restrictions, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses 'HTTP methods and media types for accessing page history and children', which is unrelated to configuring MIME types or attachment size limits.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output match any specific parts of the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context describes API endpoints and HTTP methods for managing wiki pages and attachments, but it does not address file type or size restrictions for uploads.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks specific details and endpoints mentioned in the factual alignments, indicating a high degree of missing or incomplete information."
