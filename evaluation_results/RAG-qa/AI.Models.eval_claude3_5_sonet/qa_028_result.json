  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the answer contains useful information but includes several irrelevant links that do not directly address configuring attachment restrictions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'programming rights and security permissions within the XWiki system,' which is not related to configuring file upload restrictions. Similarly, the second node is about 'cookie protection and IP address usage for encryption,' which also does not relate to file upload restrictions or MIME type configuration.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses permissions, cookie settings, dependencies, and server configuration, none of which address file upload restrictions.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks multiple critical details that are present in the context, leading to a high degree of factual misalignment."
