  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer contains useful information about disabling notifications, but it includes several irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims that modifications will apply only to future events, whereas the retrieval context indicates that changes apply to both past and future notifications in post-filtering mode.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node mentions 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences' and 'Notifications Custom Filters Preferences,' which are directly relevant to modifying notification settings, while the second node mainly discusses email notifications and their configuration, which is not directly related to disabling notifications for pages that don't interest the user.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are well-supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the context discusses email notifications and technical details about XWiki, which are not relevant to the user's question about disabling notifications for pages.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks several specific details and technical information that are present in the context, leading to a high degree of factual misalignment."
