    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes a URL that does not directly address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses the AuthorizationSettler and right definitions but does not address the specific question about denying script rights to a domain administrator. Similarly, the second node provides technical details about registering and unregistering rights but does not mention the inability to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly aligned with the information from the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context discusses various authorization and rights management topics but does not address how to deny script rights to a domain administrator.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output does not align with any of the provided contexts. It fails to mention key elements such as the AuthorizationSettler, the process of registering or unregistering rights, specific rights like Comment Right, Edit Right, Delete Right, and Administration Right, implied rights, inheritance, limitations, API, or security references."
