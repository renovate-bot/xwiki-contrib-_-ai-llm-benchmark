  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the answer provides some relevant information, but includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the issue of the notification bell not appearing.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node lists various menu options and features available in XWiki but does not address the issue of enabling notifications. The second node provides links to various notification preferences but does not mention how to enable notifications in the wiki settings. The third node discusses following users and default watch settings but does not provide information on enabling notifications in the wiki settings. The fourth node explains different programming rights and permissions in XWiki, which is unrelated to enabling notifications. The fifth node provides installation instructions and dependencies for an extension, which is not relevant to enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the 1st sentence is supported by the 1st node in the retrieval context, but the 2nd sentence is not supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.00 because the context includes various unrelated information about different applications and features, which are not relevant to the issue of the bell icon not being available even when the 'Notification d'alerte' extension is installed.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 1.00 because the actual output consistently fails to align with the provided context, discussing unrelated troubleshooting steps instead of the relevant features, extensions, notification preferences, user following settings, access rights, and installation instructions mentioned in the context."
