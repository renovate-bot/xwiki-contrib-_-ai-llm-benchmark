  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information, but it includes a URL that does not directly address the specific configuration question about XWiki permissions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.45 because irrelevant nodes, such as the first node explaining space and page management without addressing access rights, and the third node discussing a migration plan, are ranked higher than relevant nodes. However, it is not lower because relevant nodes, like the second node providing information on XWiki's permission system and the fifth node explaining wiki-wide and page-level rights, are included in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.89 because most sentences in the expected output are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, particularly regarding setting rights at different levels and creating user groups. However, there is no specific mention of adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRelevancy": "The score is 0.40 because the context provided does not address how to configure permissions for teams in XWiki, focusing instead on unrelated features and processes.",
    "Hallucination": "The score is 0.60 because the actual output lacks several key details mentioned in the context, such as the creation of spaces and WebHome pages, the temporary emulation of sub-pages, executing a migration plan, server resource usage, migration recommendations, authentication mechanisms, the Distribution Wizard, and features of XWiki Standard. However, it correctly describes the permission system, which aligns with the context."
