  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because the answer addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context is relevant as it discusses the 'Script' right and its default permissions, which aligns with the input query. However, the first node is irrelevant as it discusses language preferences and translations in XWiki, which is unrelated to script rights or administrative permissions. Additionally, the third node is also irrelevant as it lists various rights without addressing the specific issue of refusing script rights to an administrator. These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than the relevant node, affecting the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because everything aligns perfectly! Great job on ensuring all the necessary information is covered accurately.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that certain rights are not deniable, but does not explicitly state that admin rights cannot be refused as in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides detailed steps for refusing script rights, which contradicts the expected output stating it cannot be done. It lacks coherence with the expected key fact that refusing administrator rights is not supported in XWiki."
