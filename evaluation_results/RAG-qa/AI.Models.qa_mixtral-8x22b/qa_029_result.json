  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the response mostly addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node in the retrieval context, which is relevant as it 'discusses programming and script rights, mentioning that script rights can be denied,' is ranked after the first node. The first node is irrelevant since it 'is about language preferences and translations in XWiki, which is unrelated to rights management.' Additionally, other irrelevant nodes, such as the third node, 'lists various rights and their default states but does not specifically address the inability to deny script rights to an administrator,' are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context, highlighting that administrative rights cannot be denied, as supported by the relevant node. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions that certain rights like ADMIN are not deniable, but it lacks specific information about the inability to refuse rights implied by admin rights, as stated in the expected output."
