  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and effectively addresses the question about limiting attachment types and sizes. The minor irrelevant statement about XWiki basic concepts slightly detracts from a perfect score, but overall, the answer remains focused and useful.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in retrieval context, which provides information on setting maximum attachment size and mentions the XWikiPreferences document, is ranked third. However, irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, such as the first node discussing linking to external files and image display, and the second node explaining the basic structure of XWiki pages, both of which do not address attachment upload settings or restrictions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.56 because while the retrieval context's 3rd node provides detailed steps for configuring the maximum attachment size (supporting sentences related to Step 2), it lacks information on configuring allowed mimetypes in the xwiki.properties file, which is crucial for Step 1.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting maximum attachment size and mimetype restrictions but lacks specific details on configuring 'xwiki.properties' for mimetypes and setting size to 10MB."
