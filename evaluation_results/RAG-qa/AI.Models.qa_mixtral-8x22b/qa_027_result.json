  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant information included. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which 'directly addresses group synchronization by mentioning the `oidc.groups.mapping` property and the process of synchronizing group claims', is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node that 'discusses authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints, but does not mention group synchronization', and the second node that 'provides information on different authentication methods and extensions, but does not address group synchronization with OpenID Connect', are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context supports the general concept of configuring group synchronization in XWiki, it lacks specific details such as locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, providing examples, and instructions on saving and restarting XWiki, which are present in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping but lacks specific details on configuring `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and saving changes in `xwiki.properties` as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "Actual output uses `xwiki_groups` in `oidc.userinfoclaims` instead of `oidc.groups.claim`. It also lacks steps on `oidc.groups.separator`, sequence of events does not fully align, and it suggests additional customization options not in expected output."
