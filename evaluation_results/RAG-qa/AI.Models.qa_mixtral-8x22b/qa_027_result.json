  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which is the third node, directly addresses group synchronization by mentioning the 'oidc.groups.mapping' property and the need to define a mapping between XWiki groups and provider groups. However, irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing authentication management and OpenID Connect provider endpoints without mentioning group synchronization, and the second node about container authentication, are ranked higher than the relevant node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.23 because while the 3rd node in retrieval context supports configuring group synchronization in XWiki using 'oidc.groups.claim' and 'oidc.groups.mapping', many specific details such as locating and editing the 'xwiki.properties' file, setting and replacing specific properties, and restarting XWiki are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and mapping using oidc.groups.mapping but lacks details on configuring oidc.groups.claim, oidc.groups.separator, and saving changes, which are present in the expected output."
