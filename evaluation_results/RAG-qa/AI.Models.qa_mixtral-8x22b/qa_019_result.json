  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.96 because the response is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. However, it includes source links that do not contribute to answering the question, slightly reducing the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output incorrectly specifies creating an XSheet named 'Custom Right Check', whereas the retrieval context only refers to a sheet contributing dt and dd elements without mentioning an XSheet.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'validation and programming aspects', which are unrelated to the question about denying script rights in XWiki. The second node is about 'template recommendations and terminal page creation', which does not relate to script rights or their denial in XWiki. The third node involves 'custom configuration and code related to XWiki classes', but it does not address the issue of denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output sentence about XWiki's admin rights cannot be linked to any node in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any information about XWiki not supporting the denial of rights implied by admin rights, as mentioned in the expected output."
