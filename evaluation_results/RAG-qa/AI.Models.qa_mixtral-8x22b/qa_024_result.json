  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.69 because the answer partially addresses the question about disabling notifications, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to solving the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The first three nodes effectively address the input by discussing 'Choosing the default auto-watched mode', 'Notifications Auto Watch Preferences', and 'Auto Watch' and 'Filters', which are all pertinent to managing notification settings. The irrelevant node, which discusses 'RSS feeds and general notification settings', is appropriately ranked last, ensuring a perfect score. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while most sentences in the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as node 1 and node 2, the sentence about being notified of changes on your work lacks direct support from the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information about auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, aligning with the expected output. However, it lacks explicit mention of modifying these settings in the user's profile notification settings.",
    "Correctness": "Both outputs mention 'Auto Watch' and modifying notification settings. The actual output adds steps to disable 'Auto Watch' and provides source links, which are not in the expected output. There's no mention of 'Filtres personnalis\u00e9s' in the actual output."
