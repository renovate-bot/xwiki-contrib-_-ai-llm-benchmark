  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the question about disabling notifications, but includes irrelevant details such as unrelated source links and discussions about notification timing, which do not directly help in solving the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant node. The irrelevant node, ranked fourth, discusses 'RSS feeds and settings for notification types', which are not directly related to disabling notifications or managing auto-watched pages. Great job on maintaining perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on auto-watched pages and custom notification filters, aligning with the expected answer, but lacks explicit mention of modifying settings for 'Suivi automatique des pages'."
