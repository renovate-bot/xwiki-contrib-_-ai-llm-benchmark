  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the question about attachment restrictions by focusing on relevant aspects, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly answer the query about file type and size limitations.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'trusted domains and PDF export customization', which is not related to attachment limits, and should be ranked lower than the fourth node, which mentions 'Size Limit' and 'Mimetype Restriction', directly relevant to configuring attachment limits and types. Similarly, the second node about 'ODT and PDF export features' should be ranked lower than the fifth node, which provides 'detailed steps on setting the maximum size for attachments'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the steps for setting the maximum upload size in XWikiPreferences (sentence 2 to 5) are well supported by node 5 in the retrieval context, the initial instructions about configuring MIME types and file size limits (sentence 1 and parts of sentence 2) are not directly supported by any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions configuring attachment size and MIME type restrictions, but lacks specific details on setting MIME types and exact steps for 10 MB limit as in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes the key facts about limiting upload size and MIME types, but it introduces discrepancies in the steps, such as using the Attachment Validation Application instead of modifying xwiki.properties, and provides extra information not present in the expected output."
