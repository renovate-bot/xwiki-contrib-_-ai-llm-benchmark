  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the response mostly addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but it includes unrelated source links that do not contribute to answering the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'upgrading XWiki' without mentioning 'user authentication with access tokens'. The second node talks about 'features of the Administration Application' but lacks any reference to 'authentication with access tokens'. The third node focuses on 'managing user rights and profiles' and, although it mentions an 'Authentication guide', it does not directly address 'access tokens for authentication'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication, JWT, or the specific configuration steps mentioned in the expected output."
