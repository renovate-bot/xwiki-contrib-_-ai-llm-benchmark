  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response mostly addresses the question about configuring XWiki for automatic user activation with OpenID Connect, but includes a workaround suggestion that doesn't directly solve the issue, slightly lowering the relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. The first node discusses 'domain-based authentication and session cookie configuration,' which does not relate to 'automatic user activation in XWiki using OpenID Connect.' The second node provides 'general information about OpenID Connect authentication and configuration guides,' but lacks specifics on 'automatically activating user accounts.' The third node describes 'OpenID Connect authenticator and its features' without mentioning 'the specific configuration change needed in the xwiki.properties file.' Finally, the fourth node lists 'various OpenID Connect endpoints and configuration options' but omits 'the `oidc.enableUser` property or how to activate user accounts automatically.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because only the instruction to update properties in 'xwiki.properties' is supported by node 4 in the retrieval context, while key details about 'oidc.enableUser' and automatic activation of user accounts are not covered in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about automatically activating user accounts with OpenID Connect in XWiki by modifying the xwiki.properties file."
