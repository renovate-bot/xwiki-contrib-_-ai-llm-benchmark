  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is fully relevant and directly addresses the question without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node in the retrieval context is ranked fifth, while the first four nodes are irrelevant. The first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, the second node mentions various configuration guides and dependencies, the third node lists endpoints and customization options, and the fourth node discusses container authentication and other methods. These contexts do not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.20 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' and configuring OpenID Connect in the 4th node in the retrieval context supports the expected output, while the rest of the specific instructions and details are not covered.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain specific instructions about modifying the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
