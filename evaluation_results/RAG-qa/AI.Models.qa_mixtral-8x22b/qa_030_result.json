  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the answer is mostly relevant but includes a URL that does not directly address the question about configuring permissions in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses the creation of spaces and pages in XWiki but does not provide specific instructions on setting access rights for teams. The second node lists various macros and their uses in XWiki, which is unrelated to configuring team access rights. Additionally, the third node explains the parent/child relationship and the Nested Pages concept in XWiki, but it does not address how to set access rights for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain information about creating groups, defining rights at the wiki and space levels, or inheriting rights for child pages."
