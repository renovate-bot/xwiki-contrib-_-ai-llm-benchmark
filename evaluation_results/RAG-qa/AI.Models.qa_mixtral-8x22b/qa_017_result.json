  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the output provides relevant information about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, but it includes several irrelevant statements such as source links and references to unrelated documents, which detract from the overall focus on the setup process.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the actual output references 'Ergebnisdokument Nr. 1' for property listings, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context. This minor discrepancy slightly affects the faithfulness score.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question about setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. The first node discusses 'authentication management and endpoints for OpenID Connect, but does not provide specific instructions on group synchronization.' The second node provides 'information on container authentication and other authentication methods, but does not address group synchronization between XWiki and OpenID Connect.' The third node describes 'the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension and its capabilities, but does not detail the process of setting up group synchronization.' The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, which is not relevant to the group synchronization setup process.' Finally, the fifth node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, including compatibility and installation, but does not cover group synchronization setup.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.11 because only the mention of 'xwiki.properties' in the 1st node in retrieval context supports the expected output, while the rest of the expected output sentences lack corresponding information in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks details on configuring group synchronization, claim names, separators, and mappings as outlined in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output contains steps for setting up group synchronization but refers to `xwiki.cfg` instead of `xwiki.properties`. It mentions `oidc.syncgroups` while the expected output does not, and lacks detailed configuration examples for `oidc.groups.separator` and `oidc.groups.mapping`."
