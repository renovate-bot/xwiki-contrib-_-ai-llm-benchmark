  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.65 because while the output attempts to address the question about configuring team access and editing permissions in XWiki, it includes several irrelevant links and statements that do not directly relate to the specific configuration task, thus lowering the relevancy score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'databases and programming features in XWiki,' which does not relate to configuring team access and editing permissions. The second node is about 'notifications and application details,' which are not pertinent to the task of setting access or editing permissions for teams. The third node explains 'using nested pages and subwikis,' which is not directly related to the configuration of access and editing rights for teams. The fourth node provides a link to 'managing users and groups,' but it does not directly address setting specific access or editing permissions for teams. Lastly, the fifth node discusses 'group synchronization and customization,' which does not directly relate to configuring team access and editing permissions in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.29 because only sentences 1 and 4 from the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specifically nodes 4 and 3. The majority of the sentences, including those about achieving access control, setting wiki-wide and area-level rights, summarizing the steps, and adjusting rights for additional teams, lack direct support from the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to access control steps or team-specific rights management as outlined in the expected output."
