  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the answer partially addresses the configuration question, but the repeated irrelevant URLs lower its relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. The first node discusses 'creating children pages, changing page access rights, and other advanced features', which does not address configuring access for teams in XWiki. The second node provides information about 'different macros and their functionalities', which is not related to team access and permissions. The third node explains 'various aspects of XWiki Syntax 2.1', but does not mention configuring access for teams. The fourth node talks about 'XWiki applications and extensions', which is unrelated to team-specific access permissions. The fifth node is about 'language preferences and translations', which does not help in configuring access control for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about creating groups, setting wiki-wide rights, setting area-level rights, or inheriting rights for child pages."
