  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about not receiving notifications in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. However, the second node, which discusses 'filters and technical settings that do not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications or how to enable them,' and the third node, which focuses on 'RSS feeds and notification macros, which are not directly related to enabling notifications or ensuring they are received,' are ranked higher than the fourth node. The fourth node outlines 'different ways to receive notifications in XWiki, including the Notifications Application and mentions,' which is relevant to the input, and should be ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because half of the expected output sentences are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as the details about using the 'alert' menu and following users, while the other half, like enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and subscribing to pages, are not directly supported by any nodes.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context includes information on following users and notification settings but lacks details on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties and watching pages.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output correctly advises enabling notifications settings but lacks instructions about subscribing to pages or users. It mentions default settings for new users and customization, which is additional information not found in the expected output."
