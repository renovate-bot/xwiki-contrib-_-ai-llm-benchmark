    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is mostly relevant but includes a URL that does not directly address the issue of the notification bell not being available.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses getting a notification RSS feed, which does not address enabling notifications in the wiki. Similarly, the second node is about overriding default notification templates and installation instructions, which are also not relevant.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention the `notifications.enabled` property or how to set it to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
