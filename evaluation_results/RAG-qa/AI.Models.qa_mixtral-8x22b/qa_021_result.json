  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the response mostly addresses the issue about the notification bell icon, but includes irrelevant source links that do not directly resolve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job maintaining perfect alignment!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. Each node, from the first to the fifth, fails to address 'enabling notifications in the wiki settings', which is crucial for the input query. Instead, they discuss topics such as 'custom notification filters', 'various notification-related features', 'notification preferences', 'notification application and its features', and 'obtaining a notification RSS feed'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, which is the key information in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties`, which is a key fact in the expected output. It provides unrelated troubleshooting advice about the notification bell icon and extensions, which are not mentioned in the expected output."
