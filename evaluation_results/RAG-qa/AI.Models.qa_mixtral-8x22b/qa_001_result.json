  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the output contains useful information related to XWiki, but it includes multiple irrelevant statements that do not directly address the specific issue of the missing bell icon.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'installation instructions for extensions', which does not help with enabling notifications. The second node describes 'functionality of the Alert menu', not addressing the issue of enabling notifications. The third node lists 'dependencies', offering no information on enabling notifications. Finally, the fourth node talks about 'customizing notification templates', unrelated to the problem of enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the expected output about enabling notifications and setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties` is not supported by any information in the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks any mention of enabling notifications via the 'notifications.enabled' setting in 'xwiki.properties'.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides troubleshooting steps for the Alerts and Notifications Applications, but does not mention enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` as specified in the expected output."
