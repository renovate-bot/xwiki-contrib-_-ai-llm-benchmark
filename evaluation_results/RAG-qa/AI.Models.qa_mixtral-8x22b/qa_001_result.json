  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the response is largely relevant and helpful, addressing the issue of the bell icon not appearing in XWiki. However, it includes repeated irrelevant source links that do not directly solve the problem, preventing a perfect score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the actual output inaccurately describes a manual method for accessing the Alert Notifications application, whereas the retrieval context specifies the manual method pertains to installing extensions instead.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'installation instructions and prerequisites for extensions', which does not help in enabling notifications. The second node describes 'the notifications menu and its features' without addressing how to enable notifications. The third node lists 'dependencies related to the notifications extension' but fails to resolve the enabling issue. Lastly, the fourth node talks about 'overriding notification templates and installation instructions', which are unrelated to the problem of enabling notifications.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as there is no mention of enabling notifications or the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`, which is the key information in the expected output."
