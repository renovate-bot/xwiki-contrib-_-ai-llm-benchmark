  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.77 because the answer provides some relevant information on how to disable notifications, but it includes several irrelevant details about default settings, appearance of the switch, and receiving notifications after enabling types, which do not directly address the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.37 because the first two nodes discuss enabling/disabling email features and RSS feeds, which are not directly relevant to disabling notifications for specific pages. The third node, which is relevant, is ranked lower. Additionally, the fourth node talks about the 'Clear All' link and grouping notifications, which is also not relevant, while the fifth node, which is relevant, is ranked even lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only some parts of the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Specifically, the retrieval context supports the idea of being notified about changes on your work (sentence 2) and selecting notification types (sentence 3), but it does not mention 'Automatic page watching' (sentence 1) or deleting notification filters (sentence 4).",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions settings and filters for notifications but lacks specific details about automatic page watching and deleting custom filters."
