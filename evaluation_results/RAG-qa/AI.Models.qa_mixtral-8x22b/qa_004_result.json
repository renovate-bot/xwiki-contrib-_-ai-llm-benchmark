  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant with no irrelevant statements, directly addressing the question about disabling notifications in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.95 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. However, the fourth node, which 'primarily discusses email notifications and server settings,' and the sixth node, which 'is about overriding notification templates and installation instructions,' are not directly relevant to the user's query about disabling notifications for unwanted pages and should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is fully supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, showcasing a perfect alignment. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and user profile settings but lacks specific details about automatic page watching and deleting notification filters as described in the expected output."
