  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is highly relevant and directly addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions in XWiki. However, the closing statement 'If you have any further questions, please let me know!' is generic and does not contribute to the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context discuss various aspects of notifications, such as RSS feeds, customization options, email features, and notification templates, but none address enabling notifications for one's own actions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to the nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions default notification settings and the ability to enable or disable notifications but does not explicitly mention disabling the filter for one's own activity in 'Advanced filtering options'."
