  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the output mostly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki, but it includes irrelevant source links that do not directly contribute to answering the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management and OpenID Connect endpoints,' but does not mention 'user profile field customization or mapping.' The second node is about 'container authentication and various authentication methods like LDAP and Active Directory,' without any reference to 'customizing user profile fields or mapping them.' The third node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, including installation and compatibility,' but does not address 'user profile field customization or mapping.' The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension,' which is unrelated to 'user profile field customization or mapping.' Lastly, the fifth node describes 'configuration guides for specific systems and general configuration,' but does not mention 'mapping user profile fields or customizing them.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the nodes in retrieval context support the general concept of configuring OpenID Connect and mapping user profile fields in 'xwiki.properties', they lack specific examples and instructions found in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention customizing user profile fields or mapping them in the xwiki.properties file using oidc.user.mapping, which is the core information in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output uses `xwiki.cfg` instead of `xwiki.properties` and provides a different mapping method using JSONPath. It lacks the specific example from the expected output and introduces new mapping elements not present in the expected output."
