  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response mostly addresses the question about customizing profile fields in XWiki with OpenID Connect. However, it includes irrelevant information about sources, which does not directly help in solving the issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'authentication management class and OpenID Connect provider endpoints' without mentioning 'user profile field mapping or customization'. The second node talks about 'container authentication and Active Directory', which does not address 'OpenID Connect user profile field mapping'. The third node provides 'general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension' but lacks details on 'mapping user profile fields'. The fourth node lists 'dependencies for the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension', which is unrelated to 'user profile field customization'. Finally, the fifth node mentions 'configuration guides for specific systems' but does not provide information on 'customizing user profile fields with OpenID Connect'.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context supports the general idea of customizing user profile fields using 'xwiki.properties' and OpenID Connect (as seen in the 1st node in retrieval context), it lacks specific examples and detailed steps mentioned in the expected output, such as using 'oidc.user.mapping', replacing property names, and the need to save and restart XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention customizing user profile fields or using `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties`, nor does it provide examples or instructions related to these mappings."
