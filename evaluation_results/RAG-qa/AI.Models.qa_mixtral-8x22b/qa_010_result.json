  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information on configuring access rights in XWiki, but it includes a URL that is not directly relevant to the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because the relevant node discussing the configuration of wiki access rights is ranked fifth, while the first four nodes are irrelevant as they discuss topics such as the creation of spaces and pages, parent/child relationships, macros, and XWiki Syntax 2.1 links, which do not address configuring access rights for teams.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output is supported by the retrieval context, specifically the 2nd node, which discusses access control, rights management, and setting rights at various levels in XWiki.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights and groups but lacks specific steps for creating groups, setting space-level rights, and inheriting rights for child pages."
