  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because the response provides relevant information on configuring permissions in XWiki, but the inclusion of multiple source links that do not directly address the configuration question lowers the score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.67 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are generally ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. However, the second node focuses on the 'parent/child relationship and the introduction of nested pages', which does not directly address configuring view and edit permissions for teams, and it is ranked higher than a relevant node that explains the XWiki permission system. Additionally, the third node is about 'string formatting and OpenID Connect properties', which is unrelated to configuring access rights in XWiki, yet it is ranked higher than another relevant node that provides basic rules about setting wiki-wide and page-level rights.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because most of the expected output sentences are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, particularly node 4, which covers aspects like creating groups, setting wiki-wide and space-level rights, and rights inheritance. However, the retrieval context lacks specific information on adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces, which slightly affects the score.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions setting rights at different levels and inheriting rights, aligning partially with the expected answer. However, it lacks specific details on creating groups for each team and setting 'Edit' rights for team spaces."
