  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about configuring OpenID Connect for automatic user activation. However, it includes an irrelevant link to the XWiki RESTful API documentation, which doesn't address the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, but does not address the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts. Similarly, the second node discusses container authentication and mentions OpenID Connect in passing, but does not provide the specific configuration details required to solve the problem.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context nodes mention 'xwiki.cfg configuration file', 'OpenId Connect Authentication', and 'automatic synchronization', they do not provide specific instructions to add or update properties, uncomment settings, or restart the XWiki instance as detailed in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file or the `oidc.enableUser` property."
