  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.64 because the response partially addresses the question about authenticating users with access tokens, but includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not contribute to answering the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating a perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first node, ranked 1, is irrelevant as it focuses on 'LDAP configuration' without mentioning access tokens. The second node, ranked 2, is relevant as it discusses 'configuration of authorized applications', which aligns with using access tokens for authentication. The third node, ranked 3, is irrelevant since it addresses 'OpenID Connect scopes and response types', not directly related to access tokens. The fourth node, ranked 4, is relevant because it describes 'authentication with JWT', supporting the use of access tokens. The fifth node, ranked 5, is irrelevant as it covers 'various authentication mechanisms in XWiki' without focusing on token-based authentication.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.71 because while several key aspects like authenticating users with JWT, enabling the token authenticator, and configuring authorized applications are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specific details about generating a JWT token with required claims and including the token in the 'Authorization' header are missing.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions the use of JWT for authentication and the configuration of authorized applications, but lacks details on token claims and the specific process of including the token in the request header.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output matches the expected output in terms of JWT token authentication and property settings but lacks details on claims, signing key, and 'Authorized Applications' configuration. It also incorrectly mentions a fallback authenticator, which is not in the expected output."
