  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant to the input, addressing the customization of user profile fields in XWiki with OpenID Connect without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which discusses the 'xwiki.properties' file crucial for configuring OpenID Connect settings, is ranked higher than all irrelevant nodes. These irrelevant nodes discuss topics like container authentication and LDAP (second node), general OpenID Connect information without specific field mapping (third node), metadata about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension (fourth node), and dependencies for the extension (fifth node), none of which directly address the customization of user profile fields.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context lacks information on customizing user profile fields with `oidc.user.mapping` in `xwiki.properties` as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output mentions OpenID Connect and user field mapping but lacks specific instructions found in the expected output, such as editing `xwiki.properties` and using `oidc.user.mapping`."
