  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.93 because the response is highly relevant to the question about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes an unrelated statement about LDAP authentication, which slightly detracts from its focus.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions the commented property '# oidc.enableUser=true' as directly relevant to enabling user accounts on first login, is ranked first. This ensures that the most pertinent information is prioritized, leading to a perfect score. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the 1st node in the retrieval context supports the need to define and set the 'oidc.enableUser' property, it lacks specific instructions on adding or updating the property, saving the file, restarting the XWiki instance, and the automatic enabling of new user accounts.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains the necessary information about the 'oidc.enableUser' property, but lacks explicit instructions to uncomment and set it to 'true', save the file, and restart the XWiki instance."
