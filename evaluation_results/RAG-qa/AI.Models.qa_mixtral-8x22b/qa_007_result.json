  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer is perfectly relevant, addressing the specific question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions; the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first three nodes in the retrieval context provide crucial information on configuring group synchronization, such as the `oidc.groups.claim` property and `oidc.groups.mapping`, which are essential for the process. The irrelevant nodes, ranked fourth and fifth, discuss installation instructions and authentication management, which are not directly related to the group synchronization setup. Great job on achieving perfect precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the nodes in retrieval context provide specific examples and mention properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping`, they do not cover the general instructions found in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains all necessary details for configuring group synchronization, including setting the 'oidc.groups.claim', 'oidc.groups.separator', and 'oidc.groups.mapping' properties, as well as saving changes and restarting XWiki.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output includes additional information on OpenID Connect provider support and claim setup, which is not part of the expected output. It correctly mentions configuring `xwiki.properties` for group mapping and separator but uses different claim names and properties like `oidc.userinfoclaims` not mentioned in the expected output."
