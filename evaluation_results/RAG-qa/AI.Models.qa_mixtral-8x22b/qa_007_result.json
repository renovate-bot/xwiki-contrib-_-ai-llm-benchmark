  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and provides detailed instructions for configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, the inclusion of the URL 'https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiRESTfulAPI' is irrelevant to the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which provides information about group synchronization including the use of the `oidc.groups.mapping` property, is ranked fourth. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node which provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator without specific steps for group synchronization, and the second node which mentions the ability to authenticate with an OpenID Connect provider but lacks specific steps for group synchronization, are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions group synchronization and the xwiki.properties file but lacks detailed steps and specific property configurations found in the expected output."
