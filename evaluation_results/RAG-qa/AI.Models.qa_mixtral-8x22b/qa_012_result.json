  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but it includes irrelevant details about sources and XWiki skins, which slightly detract from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node contains 'a list of image links and references, which are unrelated to the topic of enabling notifications or following users/pages for notifications.' The second node also 'contains image links and references, which do not provide any information relevant to configuring notifications or following entities for updates.' Similarly, the third node 'includes image links and references, offering no guidance on notification settings or following users/pages.'",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, which only contain image links and references, not the detailed instructions or settings mentioned.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context contains image links and references unrelated to notifications or user settings, lacking any relevant information from the expected output."
