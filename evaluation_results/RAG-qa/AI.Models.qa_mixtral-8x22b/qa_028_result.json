  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response partially addresses the question about file upload restrictions, but it includes multiple irrelevant source links that do not directly relate to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses 'language support and translations in XWiki', which is unrelated to configuring file upload restrictions. The second node is about 'creating tour guides and administrating wiki features', which does not relate to setting file upload restrictions. The third node discusses 'CSS and XSL for PDF exports', which is not relevant to configuring file upload restrictions. The fourth node is about 'various features and macros in XWiki', none of which pertain to file upload restrictions. The fifth and sixth nodes contain 'image links and references', which are not relevant to configuring file upload restrictions.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context, as the context lacks any relevant information or instructions related to the topics covered in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information related to configuring MIME types or setting maximum attachment size in XWiki, as described in the expected output.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output fails to mention editing the xwiki.properties file and configuring MIME types specifically. It lacks precise instructions for setting the upload size in bytes, only providing a general approach. The expected output gives detailed steps, which are missing in the actual output."
