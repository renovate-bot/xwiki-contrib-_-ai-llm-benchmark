  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the issue of not receiving notifications directly. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly states 'Vous ne recevez pas de notifications.', while the context indicates that users do receive notifications by default under certain conditions.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which mentions 'Watched Entities' and 'Follow a user', is ranked third. Irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing RSS feed settings and the second node about overriding notification templates, should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.33 because only a few aspects of the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context, such as enabling notifications by clicking on the bell and following a user. However, key details about 'notifications.enabled', 'xwiki.properties', specific instructions on following pages or users, and viewing user events in the 'r\u00e9seau' tab are missing.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` and specific steps for following pages."
