  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.89 because the response mostly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, but includes irrelevant links that do not directly help solve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are perfectly ranked higher than irrelevant ones. The first node discusses 'Enable and disable the extension' and 'Enable and disable the email feature', which is crucial for ensuring notifications are activated. The second node includes 'Follow a user', aligning with the input about receiving notifications. The irrelevant nodes, ranked third and fourth, discuss RSS feeds and notification settings without directly addressing enabling notifications or following users, and displaying notification preferences, respectively. Great job on the ranking!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while some aspects like enabling notifications and following users are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, specific details such as setting 'notifications.enabled' in 'xwiki.properties', using the 'alert' menu, and the 'network' tab in the user profile are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "Retrieval context mentions enabling notifications and following users, but lacks details on setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` and specific steps for following pages or users.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output lacks specific instructions about enabling notifications in 'xwiki.properties' and following pages or users, which are critical data points in the expected output. It contradicts by focusing on application and filter settings not mentioned in the expected output."
