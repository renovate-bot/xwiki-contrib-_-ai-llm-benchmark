  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the response partially addresses the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, it includes irrelevant links and additional information that do not directly answer the question, preventing a higher score.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating that the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which states 'By default, you won&#x27;t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,' is ranked first and directly addresses the input question. The irrelevant nodes, discussing topics such as RSS feeds, general notification settings, and technical aspects, are appropriately ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context confirms that by default, users do not receive notifications for their own actions and mentions the option to change this setting. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output describes how to enable notifications for one's own actions, which aligns with the expected output about disabling a filter to receive such notifications. However, it includes procedural steps and additional external links not present in the expected output, and lacks direct mention of the 'Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es' section."
