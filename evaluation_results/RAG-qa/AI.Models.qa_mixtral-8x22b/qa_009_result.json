  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the response is highly relevant to the question about denying script rights to a space administrator, with only a minor irrelevant mention of content organization and nested pages migration.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first three nodes in the retrieval context provide pertinent information about the inability to deny script rights to a space administrator, such as 'programming rights can only be granted from the wiki preferences page' and 'ADMIN rights are not deniable.' The irrelevant nodes, ranked fourth and fifth, discuss unrelated topics like 'checking access rights programmatically' and 'converting rights during page migration,' which do not address the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output is fully supported by the information in the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The expected output is fully supported by the retrieval context, which states that admin rights imply other rights and cannot be denied, matching the expected answer."
