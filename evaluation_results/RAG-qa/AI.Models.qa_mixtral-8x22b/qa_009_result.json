    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the answer is mostly relevant and provides useful information about denying script rights to a space administrator. However, it includes URLs that do not directly address the question, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses methods for checking access rights in code, which does not address the specific question about denying script rights to a space administrator. Similarly, the second node talks about the checkAccess() method and its security implications, which is also not relevant to the question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention that certain rights cannot be denied if implied by admin rights, nor does it provide any information about the inability to deny rights implied by admin rights.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention that rights implied by admin right cannot be denied."
