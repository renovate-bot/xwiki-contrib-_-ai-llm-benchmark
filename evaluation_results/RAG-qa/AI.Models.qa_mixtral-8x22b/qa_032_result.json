    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant to the question about authenticating users with access tokens. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses 'group synchronization and customization for OpenID Connect,' which is not relevant to authenticating users with access tokens. Similarly, the second node is about 'cookie protection levels and security strategies,' which does not relate to access token-based user authentication.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention any of the key concepts or instructions related to 'Benutzer mit Zugriffstoken', 'Token-basierten Authentifizierung', 'externen Anwendungen', 'JWT', or the specific steps and limitations of the authenticator.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not contain any information about token-based authentication, JWT, or the specific steps for using the LLM-Anwendung (BETA) extension."
