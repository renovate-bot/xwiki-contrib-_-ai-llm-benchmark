  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the response largely addresses the issue of the unavailable bell icon, but includes irrelevant source links that do not contribute to solving the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node, ranked sixth, discusses 'editing the xwiki.properties file, which is directly related to enabling notifications by setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.' However, it is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'custom notification filters and their behavior, which is not directly related to enabling notifications in the wiki settings,' and should be ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while there is a connection between configuring settings in the retrieval context (node 5) and the expected output sentence about editing `xwiki.properties`, there is no specific mention of setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`, leading to incomplete alignment.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties` or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`."
