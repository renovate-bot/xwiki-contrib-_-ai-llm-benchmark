  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and addresses the input without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'editing the `xwiki.properties` file', is ranked last (6th). This node is relevant to enabling notifications, as suggested in the input. However, it is ranked lower than irrelevant nodes that discuss 'custom notification filters', 'alert menu and notification display', 'various notification methods in XWiki', 'links to notification-related settings', and 'notification settings for administrators', none of which address enabling notifications in the wiki settings.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the 5th node in the retrieval context mentions editing the xwiki.properties file, there is no mention of setting 'notifications.enabled' to 'true', which is a key detail in the expected output.",
    "CustomContextualRelevancy": "The retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications through the `xwiki.properties` file or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true`.",
    "Correctness": "The actual output provides troubleshooting advice and references XWiki sources but lacks specific instructions on enabling notifications in xwiki.properties as stated in the expected output. It also includes irrelevant information about contacting support."
